{"author":"MindBody360","body":"Just a comment re: the glass bottom. I believe that the rules differ from state to state. Here in Cali, Los Angeles specifically, there is a huge homeless population. A homeless child  (excuse the expression) trumps an adult, always. A woman with a child trumps men. However, there are a cornucopia of shelters in L.A. that co-exist; men's only, women and children only, women no children, etc. There are more men that are homeless. There are more women that remain with their children even after collapsing into homelessness. There are more male veterans, but more women get raped on the street. Some shelters have rules about capacity as mandated by the Fire Marshal, so if the rule is get to intake by 8:00 A.M., it's a hard number, not a suggestion. And lastly, in terms of getting help, there are programs for people of all kinds that assist individuals and families getting back on their feet. It generally would provide vouchers for immediate housing, but even if that runs out, a Case Manager or Social Worker can help get SSI, SSDI, GR, job training, clothes and medication with absolutely no discrimination. Homelessness is a huge problem for human beings, so one quarter of beds going to women is not inappropriate, to me.\nSource: Me.

{"author":"guy_from_sweden","body":"Almost all subreddits strive to become echo chambers, while simultaneously condemning them. To be honest, that also includes this one. What seems like a reasonable, justified ban in one subreddit is often easily spun to look very much the opposite in another one.\n\nIn this case, OP went into \/r\/feminism and spoke out against the notion that women have a right to *feel* safe. To us it looks a lot like OP was banned for saying something that makes perfect sense - you can't just claim that you are supposed to feel safe without a reasonable basis behind it. To them, it probably looks a lot like OP is promoting behaviour that is technically legal but considered sexist. Think stuff like cat calling. If you're a woman walking out during the evening and you pass by a group of men that cat call you - you're going to feel very unsafe although statistically the chances of them doing anything illegal in this situation is very low. That's the type of \"feel safe\" that \/r\/feminism consider obvious and that it looked to them as if OP was arguing against, even though I bet most of us in here would agree that no woman should feel unsafe while out and about on her own because other people act like pigs around her.\n\nEDIT: Lots of good responses coming in. Allow me to clarify a few things.\n\nCat calling as a behaviour should not be outlawed. I believe however that we men have a greater responsibility to speak up against it. Likewise, women cat calling should also be spoken up against. The behaviour isn't harmful per se but it really doesn't fit in a modern society in my opinion. If somebody wants to do it, that is fine I guess? But right now a lot of people seem to be convinced the behaviour is okay.\n\nNo, OP should not have been banned. That was sort of the point with this comment. I think both OP and the \/r\/feminism user had valid thoughts on the matter but due to OP being banned it seems that he had no option to clarify that and make them understand.\n\nAnd no, I don't actually think this subreddit is ban happy in particular. When I type \"strive to become\" the word 'subconsciously' fits in there too. What I mean is that hivemind thinking is commonplace here as with most other subs and this caused us to view stuff one sided, as I believe this post to be an example of.","created_utc":1482128114000,"comment_id":"dbcvqo7","parent_id":"t3_5j16nd","score":675,"submission_id":"5j16nd"}

{"author":"shaolin_cowboy","body":"Hello everyone. I'm a single dad. I feel like my son is many times more safe with me than with his mom. Before I got my son, my ex had lots of boyfriends, and the last one she was with was an ex-con who was in and out of jail a lot. \n\nI've come to realize a couple things. One, it is easier for a woman to find a man in the dating world than the other way around. Everyone knows this but few admit it for whatever reason. So the probability of a woman having multiple men in their lives is higher than most men having multiple women. Multiple people coming in a child's home probably increases the odds of something bad happening to the child, but I don't have the data, except from my own experience with my ex. I would think it would create a less stable environment. I have had my child for three years now, and in that span of time I only had one relationship with a woman and it only lasted a month. That was it. I don't really see myself meeting anyone new any time soon either. The dating scene is very bad for men these days if you ask me. I've also learned recently that women without kids don't want to date men with children. The reverse is not as true I don't think. Personally, I would not want to date a woman with more than two kids (but I might make an exception depending on the circumstances), mostly because that is a lot of responsibility, but one or two kids, I'm ok with that as long as the mother is a responsible person, and I was even this way before I had my son. However, I have seen lots of online dating profiles where women don't want guys with kids and I also had a lady turn me down recently because I had a kid. \n\nSo for the past three years, it has mostly just been me and my son. He has had his own room (for the first time in his life) and a safe environment in which to grow. I'm also college educated and work in computers. We have a total of four computers in our apartment and his computer skills have increased a great deal because of this. He sometimes surprises me and learns things I never even knew about. He actually installed hardware like the Steam Link himself and configured a programmable keypad on his $45 gaming mouse all by himself. He never really had these opportunities before. \n\nThe point is that society needs to stop assuming that the mother is always the better choice. I can't stress enough how much this needs to change. I wanted to tell my own story because I know there are dads out there still struggling, still being stereotyped by society, and still not seeing justice. Some guys out there might disagree with my story, and to this I would say I am speaking from my own experience in life. My experience may not be typical, but it is true to my own existence. \n","created_utc":1495667016000,"comment_id":"dhzan4d","parent_id":"t3_6d1h12","score":115,"submission_id":"6d1h12"}

{"author":"malpheres","body":"I had an older girlfriend right out of high school. I thought I was a baller. She'd abuse me all the time and think it was hilarious, and when I would tell her to stop she would call me a pussy. It started with just punches to the arm and it slowly graduated to slaps in the face just for her amusement. \n\nOne Sunday, we were laying around and she said 'hey, let's go to Best Buy so I can get a cd.' (I know, I'm old as fuck). And I told her no, I didn't feel like it because the Best Buy was 30 minutes away. After about 20-30 minutes of whining and complaining I gave in. We were in my car riding there, when she said, 'why are you being an asshole?' To which I replied 'how? I haven't even said anything.' Which was true because the whole car ride I was silent. \n\nShe then said 'just stop being an asshole.' And then I gave her a mockingly 'okay!' And then she punched me in my right cheek. Closed fist punch to the face while I was driving down the highway. I had enough. I pulled onto the shoulder and I grabbed her thigh and I told her to never fucking do that ever again. And then she told me to stop being a fucking pussy. \n\nI threw my car back into drive and made u-turn and went back to her house. When we got in front of her house I put the car in park and said 'get out of my car.' And then she turned on the cutesy sweet girl act like she always did and the I yelled 'GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR YOU CUNT'\n\nShe slapped me in the face again. I then got out of the car and started to walk to the passenger door. I was so mad I was going to rip her out of the car. She got out quickly and then I just turned back, got back into my car and sped off.\n\nThe next day I went over to her house to get my things while she was at work. I never talked to her again. \n\nI actually saw her a few years ago while I was hopping around the local bars when I was home visiting my parents for a long weekend. She was with some younger guy and she put on about 75lbs. It felt good to see her looking like a mess, but I felt bad for her new boyfriend.

After weighing her options, the female may choose abortion. Once she aborts the fetus, the female's interests in and obligations to the child are terminated. In stark contrast, the unwed father has no options. His responsibilities to the child begin at conception and can only be terminated with the female's decision to abort the fetus or with the mother's decision to give the child up for adoption. Thus, he must rely on the decisions of the female to determine his future. The putative father does not have the luxury, after the fact of conception, to decide that he is not ready for fatherhood.

I'm a 19 year old male that made the mistake of trusting the person I was with to take her birth control like she was supposed to. She had missed three consecutive doses of birth control and knew it. She lied and said she had taken it and wanted me to finish inside of her. She reassured me that everything is fine and that no condom is needed. She obviously ended up pregnant. We were both immature and just about homeless at the time we found out she was pregnant. I told her neither of us were ready for a child. I suggested an abortion and became an \"asshole\" for it. We eventually settled with adoption and found a great family for the baby to go to. But after explaining all this to friends and family, I was still the one at fault. They said \"well you should have made sure she was taking her birth control,\" and \"it takes two to tango.\" Some of my family doesn't talk to me because I talked her into adoption. And you know what the girl that missed the birth control and did all this got? She had everyone praising her and admiring her for going through with something as hard as adoption. I guess I could have made sure she was taking her birth control, but honestly she is an adult. That's an adult's responsibility. I just can't believe this is how it is. I can't believe everyone blames males for pregnancies even when there is clear evidence that the female was at fault. But I am glad there is this woman that can understand.

{"author":"Detective51","body":"My uncle once rolled up on a deputy sleeping in his car in a cemetery at 4:30 am.  My uncle was there to work that day removing branches that fell from a recent storm.  It really bugged him that the officer had been sleeping on the job so the next day he drove to the Sheriff's Office to complain on him.  Once there He found out that every year that officer spends the night in the cemetery (on his own time) on the anniversary of the killing of one of his best friends who was killed in the line of duty.  My uncle felt pretty shitty when he found that out and apologized to the deputy and offered to stay out there with him next year and keep him company to make up for it, but the deputy gratefully declined saying it would be weird because he mostly talks to buddy (killed deputy) all night about stuff that happened through out the year.  \n\nI did some further digging when he told me this story and found out that the Deputy who was killed was named Deputy Roger Lynch.  He was shot making entry into a home to stop a man from beating his wife and daughter on June 2nd 2005 in Livingston County Ky.  Deputy Lynch was shot 5 times by a high powered rifle at close range while both men were in tight stairwell.  Deputy Lynch drew his weapon and was able to squeeze off one shot before he died despite having being shot in the mouth on the first or second shot from the bad guy.  That one shot from his Glock .40 cal struck the bad guy in the center chest (got the aorta) killing him almost instantly.  The bad guys daughter was also shot in leg by her own dad but later recovered. Crazy thing was that Deputy Lynch actually knew that man.  They went to church together.

Regardless, just because there was no \"spice\" to this unlawful sexual connection with a minor (call it USCM) case (i.e. things to make it a \"worse\" case of USCM, like physical abuse, directly-inflicted mental trauma), that doesn't mean the crime of USCM should be tried under any lessened severity within the context of the law.","created_utc":1473728842000,"comment_id":"d7jrivt","parent_id":"t3_52f5sf","score":922,"submission_id":"52f5sf"}

Neither could consent, yet the male is the culprit. It's the same basic process that assumes males are always the aggressors in domestic violence and the women are only defending themselves. \n\nAll of this comes from the same basic thought that men are responsible\/aggressive\/violent\/etc and women are victims\/children\/innocent\/pure\/pick your positive adjective. So when young boys are raped, or sexually assaulted, they are usually made fun of with no where to turn except their own minds.

She was great and as good as pretty much  any of the men. \nShe was weaker than about 80% of the men, but then so we're 20% of the men.  She earned the respect of us all.\nSo time moved on and none of the women trying after her  for the job could pass the basic tests.\nBare in mind plenty of men trying couldn't pass either and not that many women were applying, after all you can't make women want to join.\nThen the inevitable happened. Under pressure from the politicians and feminists they lowered the test standards. They lowered them so much they had to dig a hole in the ground to get them low enough. \nPractically every woman that came in after her was on a quota. Why did they need quotas?  Because to get standards low enough for lots  more women to come in, every man that took the test pissed it. Frankly many of the women were a liability. \nIts a shame. Had they kept the standards and been patient waiting for the relatively exceptional women that could meet them to enter the workforce there  would have no problems with women in the job.\nSadly this short clip by \"man woman myth\" of a female firefighter on a gameshow is a perfect example of where quotas gets you.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/tUnNaMmA9IY\n\nBtw I watched a documentary last night.

{"author":"Red1220","body":"I worked in retail about nine years ago, and I was a bit down on my luck at the time so I had these jeans that had a hole around my ass (not that big mind you, but if you looked for it, it was noticeable). One day I was leaning on a counter doing some work and one of the girls working there (the pretty and entitled type) ran up behind me and shoved her finger in the hole and up my asshole. I felt slightly violated (and I'm a victim of long term childhood sexual abuse, I might add) but after my initial reaction and bitching for a few I was cool with it. \n\nSo I went in for my revenge. I mean, she basically finger raped my ass which definitely would count as sodomy if I were a girl- and would for me too, except for the fact that she's a girl and I'm the guy so it would somehow be me who assaulted her or something. So one day when she came in, I went up to her and slapped her ass, not as hard as possible- but definitely not a pat either. And of course, cue the typical reaction- omg you're such a disgusting pig, how dare you do that to me, a girl! ad infinitum. I was flabbergasted. My young 20 year old eyes were definitely opened that day and at that job in general. Man, I shudder to remember how I acted around the girls that worked there and the things I said to them- I could've been in some serious trouble if it were today.

{"author":"ggihhpy","body":"Never forget, Lena Dunham molested her younger sister over the course of several years.  \n\n\n\n\n> One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me. Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn\u2019t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked. My mother came running. \u201cMama, Mama! Grace has something in there! My mother didn\u2019t bother asking why I had opened Grace\u2019s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. She just got on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.\n\n\n>As she grew, I took to bribing her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a \"motorcycle chick.\" Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just \"relax on me.\" Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl, I was trying. Maybe, I thought, she would be more willing to accept kisses if I wore the face mask my grandmother had for when she did her dialysis. (The answer was no.) What I really wanted, beyond affection, was to feel that she needed me, that she was helpless without her big sister leading her through the world. I took a perverse pleasure in delivering bad news to her\u2014the death of our grandfather, a fire across the street\u2014hoping that her fear would drive her into my arms, would make her trust me.\n\n\n>\"If you don't try so hard, it'll be better,\" my father said. So I hung back. But once she was sleeping, I would creep into her room and listen to her breathe: in, out, in, out, in again, until she rolled away.\n\n>I shared a bed with my sister, Grace, until I was seventeen years old. She was afraid to sleep alone and would begin asking me around 5:00 P.M. every day whether she could sleep with me. I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. Her sticky, muscly little body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out.\n\n- Lena Dunham\n\nTo summarize.  \n\n* She bribed her much younger sister to make out with her.  \n\n* She bribed this much younger sister to \"relax on her\"  In context it has some sexual overtones.  \n\n* She admits to having some sort of titillation with having her sister sleep next to her.  \n\n* She masturbated next to her sleeping sister while she was turned on by her sitting next to her.  \n\nShe never fully admitted to molesting her sister,  Somehow, she expects us to believe she kept her hands to herself when she was trusted to sleep alone next to this girl she was so turned on by that she couldn't help but masturbate with her right there.  She should be part of this hollywood public shaming as well.  ","created_utc":1509269853000,"comment_id":"dp16p4y","parent_id":"t3_79c1fu","score":55,"submission_id":"79c1fu"}

{"author":"svenskbitch","body":"It feels like it has been only in the past five years that this issue has been taken seriously. I have ran across scores of incidents. Mostly, punishment has been light - but that is not only because of sexism, but also because of the political incentives that have led us to punish (male) sex offenders with incommensurate severity (in a recent case, a German immigrant got four years for grabbing a woman's breast - the same as for manslaughter). \n\nIf you consider all cases of adults having sex with minors as (statutory) rape, then I think there are MORE female than male perpetrators. Not because women are more predatory, but because they think it is ok. They have never learned to watch themselves or respect male sexuality like men have. \n\nThat does not necessarily mean that female predation is a more serious problem than male ones. We know too little about how men are affected - by all signs, more than most people think. And because of how we socialise gender, it may well be that men who predate are more dangerous - for the simple reason that they have to know what they are doing is predatory and would need an almost psychopathic lack of empathy to do it anyway.\n\nI find it scary that on a topic that is so important to our society, protecting children, we know so little about this, let alone are able to have a grown-up (no pun intended) conversation about it. Feminism mostly ignores or downplays it; MRM has not come up with any solid solutions and often gets mired in tit-for-that gloating outrage. Understandable, but hardly productive.

{"author":"Opiumbrella33","body":"This is infuriating. I was a victim of sexual violence as a teenager.  I ended up with an addiction because of it. After treatment and lots of therapy I began working addicts myself. \nThe amount of men who are victims of horrific sexual abuse, is so much more than anyone talks about, or even realizes.  And the resources out there are almost all for women.  Obviously women need these services, but men need them just as much.  \nPeople say there is an issue with the way that society treats and responds to women who are victims of sexual violence.  The fact of the matter is that there is problems with the way society responds to and treats victims of sexual violence PERIOD.  while there is a different dynamic between the reactions to men and women, from what I have seen, it is actually much worse, and more prolific an issue for male victims.  \nWomen seem to have the ear of society right now, when it comes to this subject.  And I really think that we need to start shouting about what is happening, and start demanding that male victims of sexual violence are given the support, resources, and belief that women are (rightfully) demanding.  This is not a women's issue.  This is effecting both men and women, and we need to stand together on this, to make changes in the way that victims of abide are treated.","created_utc":1584146587000,"comment_id":"fkep57z","parent_id":"t3_fhy5ki","score":10,"submission_id":"fhy5ki"}

It was a kind of contest, lots of different posters were created by different people and the selected ones were put up around town. Other posters presented that year: [\"This doesn't happen to guys\" poster](http:\/\/www.joyfulheartfoundation.org\/sites\/default\/files\/NoMore_ANDRE_1in6Print_022216.jpg) and [\"When your girlfriend is \"jealous\", that's abuse](https:\/\/crimestoppers-uk.org\/media\/509825\/domestic-abuse-campaign-suffolk-man-jealous_500x669.jpg).

{"author":"dragonsandgoblins","body":"I actually wrote an article inspired by this exact webpage in 2013 that was published by http:\/\/rightnow.org.au\/\n\nOr at least it was published for about 4 hours before they pulled it. I'll copy paste it here because people may as well read it:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n[This webpage](http:\/\/dcp.wa.gov.au\/crisisandemergency\/pages\/domesticviolencehelplines.aspx), hosted by the Government of Western Australia Department for Child Protection, contains two short paragraphs describing the domestic helpline services provided by this state government. The women's helpline offers a range of services for women experiencing domestic violence. The men's helpline on the other hand is more singularly focused, only offering counselling, and only for \"men who are concerned about becoming violent or abusive\".\n\nThe Government of WA does not offer a helpline service to male victims, instead assuming that women are the only victims and that men will always be the perpetrators. This is despite a growing body of evidence that males do suffer from domestic and family violence in significant numbers. For example, the [*Personal Safety Survey \\(2006\\)*](http:\/\/www.ausstats.abs.gov.au\/ausstats\/subscriber.nsf\/0\/056A404DAA576AE6CA2571D00080E985\/$File\/49060_2005 %28reissue%29.pdf) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) found that, 780,500 women and 325,700 men aged 15 years and over experienced violence from a current or previous partner in the last twenty years. In other words, 29.4 per cent of victims who suffered domestic violence were men.  92.5 per cent (301,400) of these male victims suffered this violence at the hands of a female partner. \t\n\n[The Publications and Resources](http:\/\/dcp.wa.gov.au\/CrisisAndEmergency\/FDV\/Pages\/PublicationsAndResources.aspx) webpage from the Government of WA provides domestic violence resources aimed at the general public and they are as gendered as the helpline services. Out of the \u201cFreedom From Fear\u201d resources, three fact sheets and one booklet are targeted at the violent party and, excluding the fact sheet \u201cHow do I know if I\u2019m abusive?\u201d, they all use gendered language that exclusively refers to the violent party as male and the victim as female. All of them bear subtitles describing themselves as being \"for men who want to change\", with no reference to women who may want to do the same. The fact sheet aimed at victims also uses the same gendered language.\n\nWA isn't alone. For example, NSW Legal Aid offers a [Domestic Violence Practitioner Service](http:\/\/www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au\/what-we-do\/services\/domestic-violence-practitioner-scheme) and a [Women's Domestic Violence Court Advocacy Program](http:\/\/www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au\/what-we-do\/community-partnerships\/womens-domestic-violence-court-advocacy-program) which aid women and children who are victims in legal matters such as getting Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders (ADVOs) and victims\u2019 compensation. The NSW Government Family & Community Services [Staying Home Leaving Violence](http:\/\/www.community.nsw.gov.au\/docs_menu\/parents_carers_and_families\/domestic_and_family_violence\/stayhome_leaveviolence.html) program \"...aims to prevent homelessness by working with the Police to remove the perpetrator from the family home so that women and children can remain safely where they are.\" If the NSW Government offers similar programs specialising in male victims, I was unable to find them.\n\nThe federal government also discriminates against male victims. [*The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children*](http:\/\/www.fahcsia.gov.au\/our-responsibilities\/women\/programs-services\/reducing-violence\/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children) (The National Plan) paints a pitiful picture of the federal stance on male victims. Along with use of gender biased language *The National Plan* has seen the Commonwealth commit $[86 million](http:\/\/www.fahcsia.gov.au\/our-responsibilities\/women\/programs-services\/reducing-violence\/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children\/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-questions-and-answers#5) to support women and children who are victims and only [$0.75 million](http:\/\/www.fahcsia.gov.au\/our-responsibilities\/women\/programs-services\/reducing-violence\/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children\/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-questions-and-answers#5) to male victims. This discrepancy in funding is justified through the use of misleading statistics from the ABS *Personal Safety Survey*. [The section of the page that discusses male victims](http:\/\/www.fahcsia.gov.au\/our-responsibilities\/women\/programs-services\/reducing-violence\/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children\/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-questions-and-answers#5) provides statistics that only 4.4 per cent (21,200) of men who were physically assaulted in the 12 months prior to the survey were assaulted by a current\/previous partner compared with 31 per cent (73,800) of women who were physically assaulted. This is misleading because it doesn't compare the quantity of male victims to female victims \u2013 instead it compares what percentage of all assaults against men were domestic violence to what percentage of all assaults against women were. Looking at just  these numbers \u2013 21,200 male and 73,800 female victims \u2013 the divide in funding  is twenty-five times greater than the divide in victims. *The National Plan* claims only \"a small proportion of men are victims\", yet the ABS survey shows that  they are roughly a quarter of all domestic violence victims. Is that really such a minority as to warrant less than one per cent of the funding committed under The National Plan?\n\nOur state and federal governments are perpetrators of gender discrimination. Those discriminated against are not only men, they are victims. Victims who are denied services and support they need based on their gender. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nI apologise  for the fact that some of the figures are out of date (for example I am pretty sure the funding disparity under the national plan has incresed since 2013), and any dead links.

If those so called ''feminazis'', aka misandrist feminists, are the the swords that are fucking men up, then those who are defending feminism as a movement are the shields that are making it possible for those man hating feminists to have a powerful voice and to have a powerful platform from where they can fuck men up as we have seen from the sexist laws that they have passed, or from the bills, that would have made things equal for men, that they have blocked. \n\nFeminism has a very strong presence in the West and It has a very big influence on campuses and in the political field. So if there are some misandrists in the movement and especially if they are in a position of power, they can do some serious shit to men as we have seen already. It's not always some sexist bitch who is just a no one in the Internet and who is just saying some sexist stuff, a lot of times it's in fact a sexist bitch that can carry on with what she's saying and wil actually hurt men. \n\nAnd with how much men's rights movement has no power to oppose those sexist feminists, especially because of how feminism has branded anyone who wanted to be an MRA as a ''mysogynist'' for the past 50 years, and we know sadly how much weight does that word have as opposed to the word ''misandrist''. Even politician don't or can't in some cases oppose them cause even if those feminists are wrong, the first word that they will scream is '' mysogynist'' and that will make those politician loose support. So now only the '' real and good feminists '' that are defending feminism on the Internet are left to actually do something, yet they really think that denouncing this shit on the Internet when they sense that feminism is being targeted will actually fix things, when in fact what they are doing is only defending the platform that misandrist bitches will use to shit on men without any actual opposition.","created_utc":1534997484000,"comment_id":"e4nhs39","parent_id":"t3_99c6c3","score":22,"submission_id":"99c6c3"}

It's really common on Reddit to see comments along the lines of \"your partner should be perfect when you meet them, because you can never reasonably expect them to change\". I think this is good advice to an extent, but it is one sided.\n\nAs I said, everyone is flawed. Sometimes the best thing you can do is find someone whose flaws you can live with. But I've seen couples work out personal issues more effectively together than they would have on their own. It's actually pretty well documented that men especially excel when they are faced with the potential for starting a family. \n\nSometimes we need help to become more functional people. No one should be obligated to be partners with a dysfunctional person, but sometimes that's a means for improvement.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom and *losing* a partner to trigger improvement.

{"author":"gmcalabr","body":"There's a middle ground here. Like a lot of things feminists do, theres a logical basis for the feminist philosophy that often gets totally hidden later on. Stick with me for a sec.\n\nIf your friend Jane (or John or whoever) tells you that they were raped, there's little harm in treating it as truth. It's not reasonable to tell Jane \"you're a liar, I don't believe you.\" Better off being supportive to a friend who may be in great need of support.\n\nHowever, once the accusations come, it becomes reasonable to try to keep a standpoint of innocent until proven guilty. Jane says Gary raped her? Ok, let's support her as a real victim but let's not try to ruin Gray's life just yet.\n\nSo like all things, yes, it's inhuman to treat a potential rape victim like a liar right off the bat, but it's also medieval to treat someone like a rapist without some proof.\n\nAlright, I'm sitting and prepared for the downvotes. Go ahead. Seriously though, everyone has a philosophy for a reason. Feminists are tired of the doubt and wish to support rape victims. I think this is great.

{"author":"tenchineuro","body":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bradley_Amendment\n\n**This reinforces the approach that inability to pay is no excuse.**\n\n#Notable cases\n\nThe Amendment has been a controversial law and has resulted in several notorious examples:\n\n*    Bobby Sherrill, a Lockheed employee in Kuwait from North Carolina, was captured by Iraqis and spent nearly five months as an Iraqi hostage. Sherrill was arrested the night after his release for not paying $1,425 in child support while he was a hostage.[9][10][11][12]\n\n*    Clarence Brandley, a Texas high school janitor, was wrongly convicted in 1980 of murder.[13] After spending many years in prison and on death row,[14] he was released in 1990 and he then sued the state of Texas for wrongful imprisonment in 1993.[15] The state then responded with a bill for nearly $50,000 in child support that had not been paid while in prison.[10][11] Dianna Thompson of The American Coalition of Fathers and Children told the Houston Chronicle that federal law makes it illegal for states to forgive child support payments regardless of circumstance.[16] Michael McCormick, of the American Coalition of Fathers and Children said, concerning child support payments, \"I'm not aware of any state where it says a wrongly convicted individual is relieved of their obligation.\"[17] Despite paying child support every month since his release via wage garnishment, Brandley's child support total reached $73,000 in 2003, when a judge reduced his total to $22,000; however, this amount is still more than triple the $7,000 in back child support Brandley owed at the time of his arrest in 1980.[15] Recently, Brandley lost his job in the economic downturn in 2008; he has since lost his car and house as the child support bills and interest keep coming.[15]\n\n*    Taron James, a U.S. Navy veteran from California, was forced to continue to pay child support until 2006, even after the child was demonstrated by DNA test in 2001 to be not his; James paid $12,000 in such payments.[18][19] A California District Court of Appeal eventually set aside the paternity judgment against James in 2006, but the same court denied James' request to have his child support payments reimbursed.[20]\n\n*    Larry Souter was wrongly convicted of murder in 1992 and spent 13 years in prison[21] before being exonerated and released in 2005. Upon release, he was ordered to court to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt for failing to pay $38,000 in combined back child support, interest, and penalties.[21] Payments were not suspended for at least 3 years while he was in prison.[21] The interest and penalties accumulated while he was still in prison, and presumably unable to pay.\n\n*    Geoffrey Fisher was taken to court in 2001 due to being delinquent on child support payments, and had his driver's license suspended.[22] Fisher pushed for custody, and a state-ordered paternity test determined he was not the biological father.[22] In January 2002 a judge determined he no longer had to pay child support, but the attorney general's office claimed that Fisher still owed $11,450, approximately 3 year's worth of back support payments from the time of the child's birth until the time of the paternity test.[22] State officials have stated that this is because Fisher failed to file a court motion to relieve himself of financial responsibility to the child, and that Fisher is thus regarded as the legal father and responsible for child support.[22]\n","created_utc":1537392690000,"comment_id":"e6952gy","parent_id":"t3_9h51g6","score":718,"submission_id":"9h51g6"}

Typically woman (not saying it's right or wrong just commonly true) that bear the burden of the daily cost of raising a child by providing housing and food. To place the custodian in jail would mean the state would also have to assume responsibility for the child which costs even more. The reverse of this could easily be true if the father was the full time custodian. In the real world though how small is the percentage of deadbeat parents that actually do jail time for that and that alone? \nThe system is of course absurd.

{"author":"AngryGlenn","body":"Came here from \/r\/All, so forgive me for jumping in where I'm not familiar, but I want to make a point to perhaps inspire some discussion.\n\nI think that the main problem feminists have with the objectification of women is that there is an established history of women being valued for nothing except their bodies. Women have been, by and large, traditionally viewed strictly as sexual objects, and their merit comes from how attractive they are. Things are changing in this regard, but very slowly. Posts like this that objectify females are strong reminders of that history.\n\nMen don't mind being objectified because it doesn't come at the expense of being valued as a whole, complex person. People do not see men strictly as sexual objects, so it's easy to take this objectification in a light-hearted way.\n\nNow, I'll admit that there are a lot of people who do want their cake and to eat it, too. (I think they're disparagingly referred to as Tumblrinas?) Those are not people that are furthering the conversation. I'm not defending them here. They are the equivalent of the neckbeard who tells women that they \"belong in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant.\"\n\nI do think that there is the possibility for a lot of really good discussion here, if people try to avoid easy japes and try to look past the opportunity to get outraged, and instead think and perhaps make some progress.\n\nSorry to intrude on your sub.

{"author":"Chris153","body":"This is a gross oversimplification of larger issues. It's not as though these boys need more or less masculinity in their lives. It's that they may be getting it from other subpar sources.\n\nSociety, at present, communicates the idea that children should grow up to be more like the adults of their own gender than the adults of the opposite gender. You could say this is a good thing, or that it's bad. Either way, a male child in a single mother household is going to look to other role models for notions of what a 'man' is. Single mothers may be more likely to expose their boys to subpar masculine models (dude on the street corner, irresponsible celebrities, etc.). Or, there may be a representation bias whereby aggressive and criminal men are the ones we know came from single-mother homes whereas we never hear about the success stories. \n\nIt's not a matter of degree of masculinity (more or less, positive thing or negative), it's a matter of what that masculinity means in context. Does it mean aggression and criminality? Or does it mean moral fortitude and responsibility. Y'all remember that [karate mentorship video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ooAOc9Fwg0U)?

{"author":"gg2late","body":"BBC pay review will give men more rises than women\n\nMatthew Moore\n\nMore men than women will receive salary rises at the BBC after managers carried out a review of presenter pay to address allegations of discrimination from female staff members.\n\nNearly 200 on-air staff will be entitled to automatic pay boosts as the corporation looks to impose a clear structure for talent salaries for the first time. The broadcaster was forced to take action after dozens of female staff complained that they were earning less than male colleagues.\n\nHowever, the \u201cfair and transparent\u201d framework announced yesterday will benefit a larger number of men than women. Analysis by the auditors PwC identified 98 male presenters and 90 female presenters who are entitled to a rise because their salaries are below the new pay ranges for their roles.\n\nThe prospect of male presenters being awarded larger salaries threatens to inflame tensions within the corporation at a time when many women staff feel that their complaints about pay inequality are not being taken seriously.\n\nLord Hall of Birkenhead, the BBC\u2019s director-general, and Sir David Clementi, its chairman, will be questioned today on the proposals by MPs. The development comes after Carrie Gracie resigned this month as China editor, accusing the BBC of illegal gender discrimination and reviving the pay dispute.\n\nThe PwC review of 824 presenters\u2019 salaries found that the BBC\u2019s excessive respect for established male stars, combined with a lack of consistency and transparency, was to blame for on-air pay \u201canomalies\u201d. There was no evidence of unlawful gender bias, however: the 6.8 per cent gender pay gap among presenters was smaller than its overall figure of 9.3 per cent.\n\nThe worst disparities occurred in lower-profile presenting roles. Among the top tier of hosts and correspondents, the gender pay gap was 0.4 per cent. Some male stars, including John Humphrys, have agreed to a pay cut.\n\nThe BBC Women campaign, which represents more than 170 employees, demanded a full equal pay audit. \u201cThere has been no transparency on which individuals were included or why,\u201d it said. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said the review\u2019s rejection of gender bias in pay \u201cflies in the face of reality our members say they are experiencing\u201d.\n\nJennifer Millins, a partner at Mishcon de Reya who is advising several BBC women, accused the corporation of giving \u201cpretty extraordinary\u201d justifications for paying some men more. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t deal with individual complaints of discrimination,\u201d she said, adding that the risk of litigation \u201cis pretty high\u201d.\n\nThe PwC report found that \u201ctoo much weight had been placed on the prominence and profile of certain individuals\u201d, mostly male, resulting in instances of very high pay. But pay disparities between those in similar jobs appeared to be driven by \u201cmaterial and justifiable factors unrelated to gender\u201d, such as different levels of experience, skill and market influences. In response, the BBC proposed a new grading structure for presenter pay, with narrower bands and clear criteria. The corporation is proposing a pay cap of \u00a3320,000 in its news department.\n\nAlthough the new framework will benefit more men, the BBC said that a greater proportion of female presenters were receiving increases. About 34 per cent of women in the relevant career bands are entitled to rises, compared with 25 per cent of men. On average the women will get larger increases.\n\nSeparately, the BBC said yesterday that 230 pay grievances had been lodged since July, with salaries adjusted in 90 cases. Most beneficiaries were thought to be women. Lord Hall told Channel 4 News last night: \u201cI don\u2019t believe there has been illegality in the BBC to the point where someone said you\u2019re a woman therefore you\u2019re going to be paid less.\u201d He said his reaction on hearing Humphrys make light of Gracie\u2019s pay complaint was \u201cWhy, why, why?\u201d","created_utc":1517435387000,"comment_id":"dtindvj","parent_id":"t3_7u6w1r","score":63,"submission_id":"7u6w1r"}

There have also been several other posts here over the past months to raise funds for this. Thanks to our help, CAFE successfully reached their $50,000 goal to open the shelter!\n\nReddit was auto-deleting comments with the GoFundMe link, but if you go to the AMA linked above it has the link there. They are still raising additional funds so you can still contribute if you haven't yet. From the GoFundMe link:\n\n>We're so grateful that with your generous support, we've reached our goal of raising $50,000! But if you haven't contributed yet, you still have a chance to donate now and be a part of this special moment. Additional funds translates into a bigger shelter that will support many more families in need, along with improved services that will help men and children heal and rebuild their lives.\n\nThis is a major accomplishment for the men's rights movement and for \/r\/mensrights specifically. Thank you to everybody who donated!\n\nMore encouraging news: While previous fundraising efforts like this have relied almost solely on MRAs, men's rights is finally becoming mainstream enough to draw support from the general public. This includes a **$10,000 grant** from the Ontario REALTORS Care\u00ae Foundation for this shelter.","created_utc":1515294591000,"comment_id":"dsaa12u","parent_id":"t3_7ol5st","score":73,"submission_id":"7ol5st"}

I also added that, for further illustration, a man can in some contexts be described as pretty. They started giggling and said \"*you're* pretty\" and one girl reached out and ran her hand along my arm. \n\nMiniature panic inside.

Good! End of story. The husband got more money and the ex is upset. Big whoop, she can deal.\n \nHowever, on the other side, IF this was the US, I'm almost positive that his company would have to be listed in the tangible and non-tangible assets that each person owns at the time of divorce. If the husband didn't bring up the company at all because it \"wasn't worth mentioning\", he's gonna get shitcanned out of his money. However if I'm misinterpreting this, and he didn't bring up talk about the IPO (which I think is the case here), then that's fine. Company business is company business. If the divorce is settled already, he has no obligation to give her any of the shares or any of the revenue.\n \nThis is of course excludes consideration of any kids, alimony, and that this is Australian divorce law, and I don't really know how that works.","created_utc":1491424647000,"comment_id":"dfuy6x7","parent_id":"t3_63l074","score":449,"submission_id":"63l074"}

Men are more lenient with gender roles. PERIOD. PERIOD. It is THAT simple, and no amount of endless discussion changes this very obvious fact. A tomboy is taken infinitely more seriously in both sex and business by both men and women than a feminine man. Period.\n\nUntil women change dating and sexual patterns to better reflect modern times, men will do what they have to do to have sex.

Yeah sure men can be very shallow and are turned on by physical attributes just as often as women can be as well but emotions and mental image play a very large role in what we do. Using a strip club as an object of male sexuality is really really assinine.\n\nThe key thing is that you cannot fucking generalize people like that it's utter nonsense. The thing to really say is that men are really hardwired to be sexual beings in most cases as a result we often need to find a release for that high sex drive. That does not mean we do not have emotional attachment to our partners or we go about fucking and enjoying ourselves as often as possible.\nI've been in open relationships and while i can go through the act of fucking some complete stranger i care nothing for i often come back feeling empty and unfulfilled because emotions play a larger role in sexual fulfilment than we are lead to believe.

{"author":"Attentive1","body":"So let me get this straight. A 34 yo woman illegally has sex with a juvenile. She's convicted of raping a minor in Criminal Court but Family Court deems the minor equally responsible for the outcome (pregnancy\/birth) by saying that the minor was a willing participant. Yet the Criminal Court pressed charges on behalf of society because the minor cannot legally give consent. \n\nLet's see: \n\n* The male minor had no authority over whether the pregnancy should be terminated. Had it been a female rape victim she would be entitled to a late term abortion caused by rape. \n\n* The minor cannot get a job without parental and school consent and at that age it can only be a part-time job.\n\n* He can't sign legally binding documents at that age. \n\n* He can't legally move out on his own much less quit school\n\n* He can't join the military at that age. \n\n* He can't smoke or drink alcohol at that age. \n\n* Also, legally the 15 yo is both underage and the victim of rape. Why is his identity not protected by the court? \n\nIt seems to me that the minors legal rights are seriously restricted. I'm willing to guess that they're restricted because his judgment is deemed immature. \n\nSo the idea is to saddle this minor with a debt that keeps accumulating until an unspecified date in the future. \n\nWhere are the adults, the good people, that should be stepping up and saying that this is a secondary abuse of the minor?

The run-down is that this guy runs a small barber shop where he and his employees are only trained\/qualified to cut men's hair. He said in an interview that barber training is only 6 months, while hairdresser training is 3 years.\n\nHis shop is surrounded by hairdressers on all sides, so when women do come into his shop he simply refers them to one of the salons within 20 steps of his front door. It's never been a problem, until now.\n\nThe complainant here is Sydney lawyer Amy Carr, who demanded that he cut her daughter's hair and did not accept his refusal. She ultimately hauled him into court and he's been forced to settle the case before going to trial so he isn't ruined by legal costs. She has the advantage of being able to represent herself in court, so naturally cost isn't a concern to her.\n\nMany people are contrasting this case with women-only gyms, which are explicitly granted a legal exemption from anti-discrimination legislation. Despite the fact that barbers like this guy aren't professionally qualified to cut women's hair, they have no such legal protection. They're in a no-win situation: cut a woman's hair and risk being sued for doing a job they're not qualified to do, or refuse to cut a woman's hair and face a discrimination lawsuit.\n\nHere are a couple of other stories about this case:\n\n[\u2018Exhausted\u2019 over haircut refusal](https:\/\/www.themorningbulletin.com.au\/news\/sydney-barbers-legal-battle-refusal-to-cut-girls-h\/3463651\/)\n\nFrom April: [Lawyer breaks silence in Barber dispute](https:\/\/weeklytimes.com.au\/lawyer-breaks-silence-in-barber-dispute\/)","created_utc":1531336098000,"comment_id":"e26niz1","parent_id":"t3_8xylkw","score":1627,"submission_id":"8xylkw"}

{"author":"--Edog--","body":"my wife is divorcing me because I did not provide enough, did not move upward enough, did not \"pan out\" - she saw potential in me but I did not pay off. I stayed with a job that I loved but did not pay that much and I did not study to get a better job that paid more. The marriage was a business, and I was an underperforming salesman. She was hoping at this point in our marriage she would be able to \"cut back\" to working 2 days a week once I worked my way up to six figures - this was her plan. All her co-workers support her on this. Along the way - she treated me badly when she saw I was not really motivated to make more money -  and I developed chronic pain, which can only be treated by meds that make me really tired most of the time which makes it hard to work full time - so I earn even less money. I will never believe in marriage or the love of women again.For reference: IF I married a woman and she wanted to keep the same job for 30 years making about the same amount of money, I would not use it as a reason to dump her. If ANY man used lack of professional and financial advancement as a reason to dump his wife he would be crucified on social media. Edit: My wife has shared stories of other \"unfortunate\"  female friends of hers who bet on the wrong horse: Married a guy who didn't live up to his potential professionally. The fact that people are debating this issue tells me there are a lot of younger folks on this SUB. All I ill say is this - you can say Chris is wrong and I am wrong - but Come back to this issues 10 or 15 years from now - see if your thoughts change. Oh - my brother is also getting divorced from his wife for the same financial issues - his wife continues to earn more than him - and he has just not moved forward at all - creating a big financial stress and problems in their marriage -  they cannot continue to afford the mortgage on the $600,000 house they bought together - and it's basically really is his fault for not being able to come up with his share of the mortgage. It's true - he cannot. They could sell the place and move to a cheaper condo -but she is fed up with it all and is dumping him. He'd do anything to stay with her - she is getting full custody of the kids - including his 3-year-old son. he's pretty crushed.

She got that job when there was an incident where a few firies were found to be running a facebook page rating the bonkability of some of their female colleagues. They were dickheads but they certainly didn't reflect the fire service as a whole. For political reasons, this turned into a massive scandal, the old fire service commissioner was sacked, and Katarina, who was then the assistant-commissioner of the cops at the time was selected to rid the fire service of its 'endemic sexism'.\n\nAs soon as she took up the job, she announced she wanted 50\/50 recruiting of men & ladies. None of the firies I knew had a problem working with the ladies in the job at that stage as they were all recruited to the same standard as the men. They were excellent. Now, although the bar was still officially the same, the standard was dropped dramatically. Strength tests were removed and replaced by more fitness tests. 5ft-nothing women started getting into the job. During one years recruitment, there was 11,000 male applicants. The fire service took approximately 100, the top .9%. That same year, there was 300 female applicants, 50 getting jobs, the top 17%. By the high standards of the fire service, a lot of them were terrible. Now all of sudden, all new women firies are viewed with suspicion; Is she one of the good ones who perform to the same standards as the men or is she a 'diversity hire' and will need to be baby sat during incidents to stop her injuring herself or a member of the public. \n\nAfter seriously watering down the QFES standards and causing division amongst the female and male firies that never existed before her, she was hailed as a hero and given the top job as the top cop, and her first new policy? Abandoning 50\/50 recruiting! Fuck me!","created_utc":1571296819000,"comment_id":"f3zexxs","parent_id":"t3_diwjlj","score":108,"submission_id":"diwjlj"}

If anything it could maybe be some kind of simple assault and it should be taken into account it was a moment of passion. But if it was so bothersome why did she not stop having sex? I didn't read anything more than her asking him to stop touching her boobs and if she did ask him to stop(sex) then obviously he must have as she isn't accusing him of rape or anything so that would be clear he wasn't trying to commit a sex crime. If a woman grabbed a mans boobs like this that he was insecure of and pleaded her to stop would that be a sex crime? Its so unfair to classify him as a sexual predator and ruin his life over something like this but the woman that stabbed someone on a similar life path doesn't deserve to have her actions fuck up her life some. To those that think its not comparable that to me is how it is, making a woman's life more valuable not worth being thrown away over a mistake(much worse one!!)

When is it ok to have sex with someone without consent?\n\n* if the couple is planning on getting married\n* If the couple is married\n* If the one partner lead the other on \n* If they had sex before \n* never \n\nI am sad to say very few kids said never.  The girls in that class tend to be a little more outspoken than the boys and they started the conversation off arguing that being married or having had sex before implies consent forever. I thought I did a good job explaining why that isn't the case. (For example, the couple has a big fight. One person wants to make up with sex, the other doesn't even want to look at their spouse. So the one that wants to have sex insists, saying it'll make the other feel better, and forces it. That is rape.) Unfortunately, when we moved on to the next task, reading through different scenarios to decide if the scenario described consent or coercion, we read about a girl inviting another girl up to her room. She was taken advantage of, but the students said, \"why did she invite her up to her room then, what was she thinking?\" Again, this was a female student that called out. There is a lot that young kids don't know. They don't know the norms about sex and they're too uncomfortable to talk about it, so there's plenty of miscommunication. \n\nAdd that to the fact that society slut shames girls who are open and honest about wanting sex. So most girls play hard to get. How is a guy supposed to know if the girl is saying stop because she really wants him to stop, or if she wants him to continue but doesn't want to feel like a tramp? We need to be more open when talking about sex and what we want. \n\nSame holds true for guys. Girls assume that guys would never reject sex. So when a girl gets rejected, there can only be two reasons: he's gay, or he's got a small dick. A guy can say no and a girl can press on, and rape him  (especially if he is too drunk to overpower her), and she'll think she's doing him a favor. He must've wanted it - he's a guy. \n\nWe really need to attack these social expectations for men and women in regards to sex and have an open and honest conversation with the youth in this country about enthusiastic consent.","created_utc":1481018937000,"comment_id":"dau7slv","parent_id":"t3_5gmam0","score":14,"submission_id":"5gmam0"}
{"author":"remarker","body":"Unpopular opinion here, but I'm not a fan of this critique, it's illogical at various times and makes claims bigger than the narrative actually enforces. To be clear, I do despise the narrative, but this list was made emotionally and not based on sound logic and organized thought. Clearly whoever made this wanted it to be shared, and if you want a list shared, it should be accurate, clean, and sound. I'm here to tell you why I believe it's not.\n\nMy thoughts, point by point:\n\n1. Not every \"teach men not to rape\" ad or whatever starts with this assumption, but a lot of them do, some simply assume instead that all men are *capable* of rape, which is a distinct but also bullshit premise.\n2. The narrative does not specifically tell people not to ALSO defend themselves from rape, but by focusing on this narrative *at all*, it takes away from where \"advice\" can actually help with the problem. This list definitely needs the word \"focus\" to appear in it way more often instead of outright stating directly that the narrative says to stop defending yourself, which you know, it doesn't.\n3. Insensitive maybe, logical yes. If their premise is accurate, hypothetically, then yes it's not wrong to tell a victim not to do that same action against someone else. Can anyone tell me that rape victims have never raped anyone in the future? The logic would be the same as telling someone who got something stolen from them never to steal from anyone. It's not an inconsistent position. So, this point is bullshit.\n4. A statement about one thing (in this case men) does not make a statement about another thing false. The problem again, is taking focus away. But I believe this narrative is flawed as a whole because it specifically targets the message to perpetrators, which is as useless as the \"rhinos are endangered, stop poaching rhinos\" ads you see occasionally. But the narrative does *not explicitly* erase female crimes, it simply states where it believes there is a bigger problem.\n5. This is the best point in the list, because this is what I believe the problem to be. I would just add the word \"immoral\" to the list with the word \"illegal\".\n6. Isn't this basically the same point as #1?\n7. Nothing wrong with paranoia, everyone could use a bigger dose of it, again, its about focus, people need to be paranoid about *everyone* not just your average guy at a park with his kid. As for hysteria, really? The nuts you see in some of the videos we've seen are just localized to protests and such.\n8. This is the biggest effect of the campaign\/narrative, it teaches and enforces the idea that men specifically are inferior or something to be feared.\n\nAfter all that, I realized I really want someone to start a campaign of paranoia in general, and not targeted just to a specific group of people. Like a series of ads reminding you to watch your back at 2am even around people you might not suspect capable of a crime, or to never leave anything you own anywhere in public.","created_utc":1480990954000,"comment_id":"datktfi","parent_id":"t3_5gmam0","score":58,"submission_id":"5gmam0"}

{"author":"mhandanna","body":"Great article on this issue, from a fantastic webiste, I could not recommend enough:\n\n[https:\/\/becauseits2015.wordpress.com\/2020\/06\/07\/conscription-a-gender-based-injustice-around-the-world\/](https:\/\/becauseits2015.wordpress.com\/2020\/06\/07\/conscription-a-gender-based-injustice-around-the-world\/)\n\nCovers all the common FAQ questions, common rebuttals etc \n\n**Can conscription be a gender injustice against men if those in power who implement the policies are mostly men themselves?**\n\nAt least in a democracy, you can\u2019t simply blame policies on the government with no regard for the population that puts the government in power. In some countries the population even voted directly to support conscription in a referendum. Conscription was supported by 60% of voters in [Austria](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2013_Austrian_conscription_referendum) and 73% in [Switzerland](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/swiss-conscription\/swiss-voters-reject-bid-to-scrap-military-conscription-idUSL5N0HI0MR20130922). That can\u2019t be *only* men.\n\nI can\u2019t find a gender breakdown from those countries, but a 2011 Pew poll in the U.S. found that men were 1.4\u00d7 more likely than women to want to activate the draft ([23% versus 16%](https:\/\/archive.is\/6kN6T#selection-711.0-711.105)). On the other hand, a 2016 Rasmussen poll in the U.S. found that men were 1.6\u00d7 more likely than women to want to extend draft registration to both sexes ([61% versus 38%](https:\/\/archive.is\/nsH8d#selection-1525.0-1533.133)).\n\nEven if we\u2019re discussing a country where conscription is entirely the fault of a mostly male group of rulers, that doesn\u2019t stop it from being a gender-based injustice. It\u2019s entirely possible for them to discriminate against or mistreat men, especially (but not only) if they themselves are exempt. Them being male doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily feel any sort of gender-based solidarity with the male part of the population they\u2019re ruling over. It\u2019s possible for them to have attitudes that we could refer to as \u201cinternalized misandry\u201d (by analogy with the concept of \u201cinternalized misogyny\u201d for women).\n\n**If a system of gender-discriminatory conscription is upheld in a referendum (or is just known to be widely supported in the country), does that legitimize it?**\n\nI think that gives it democratic legitimacy, which is better than not having democratic legitimacy, but it doesn\u2019t make the policy exempt from criticism on other grounds like gender equality or individual rights. Ireland had a referendum on abortion in [1983](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland), which the anti-abortion side won with 67% of the vote. This gave the ban on abortion democratic legitimacy. Should that have made people who support abortion give up their criticisms? If they had given up, maybe the [2018 referendum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thirty-sixth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland) on abortion wouldn\u2019t have been held or won by the pro-abortion side this time (with 66% of the vote).","created_utc":1594329664000,"comment_id":"fxf4d3p","parent_id":"t3_hnwxq0","score":18,"submission_id":"hnwxq0"}

If anything, I want the best for my wife, daughter, mother...etc. When my wife was denied an incremental yearly pay rise due to the fact she'd had a few months of maternity leave it was two women who tried to deny her the entitlement. I had to get some men from the union to sort it out. They were all overwhelmingly sympathetic to the injustice and did what was right in order to fix it.  \n  \nIMO it's really easy to jump onto the bandwagon of an activist movement and claim disadvantage by association.

If you're a male then I don't give a fuck if you were bashed because as an outsider to our group your experience doesn't matter to me.  \n  \nHopefully more people can adopt the stance of 'I believe they are all worthy of listening to'.

{"author":"BIGJFRIEDLI","body":"Just for the sake of posterity, I go to Baylor. I had friends on the football team. The girl who accused him of sexual assault he had been seeing for some time as a side piece to his longterm gf from penn state, and walked with him to his home from the local bar they were drinking at that night. Which does indicate that she would know what would happen if she went back with him, seeing as it was a regular thing. Which may have been the reason he was found not guilty.\n\nOn the other side of things, any one of my friends who I asked had no hesitation in saying they thought he did it. The girl had, if I remember correctly, 6 vaginal tears and other bruising that was consistent with being held down and brutally sexually assaulted according to the medical professional who examined her. Aside from that, the few times I met him, he just seemed a bit... I don't know how to express it. Even in groups of people his shoulders were always hunched, head forward, scanning constantly, and acted aggressive with little provocation at one bar that I met him in. That's not to say that people can't have off days, but as this was a regular occurrence and his typical demeanor according to the people that played with him, I took that as being a part of his personality.\n\nNobody knows what happened between the two of them at his place. Could be he got too rough and she wanted him to stop and he didn't (since you don't get tears and bruising from going slow), but it's also possible she was trying to cash in on him going to the NFL. Which, also to be fair, the dude was *not* going in the first round of - SI was talking out their asses at the height of the memes at the time. He was a 2nd or 3rd round prospect, someone they'd have to teach a *lot* of technique to and someone who took a lot of plays off. He mostly just out-physical'd the offense which doesn't work as well in the NFL as it does in college.\n\nPoint is, I don't think this is a good example of a case where a man clearly in the right has his life ruined by false accusations. They could absolutely be false, and I could definitely see them as being true but difficult to prove seeing as she went home with him - though even if she went back and said no, that's still no room to just take what you want. Either way he's been given the \"not guilty\" and is currently in a smaller football league, and if he works hard enough I have no doubt he has the physical skills to work his way towards a much better pay in the future.","created_utc":1551974406000,"comment_id":"ehzbzjc","parent_id":"t3_ay8j6u","score":360,"submission_id":"ay8j6u"}

{"author":"IAmFireAndFireIsMe","body":"With my future wife, my sisters, my mother and my female friends I honestly do feel appreciated and loved. It's amazing how much love women will give you.\n\nHowever, and I do this because my future wife has asked me not to, and as it goes against everything I have ever been taught by my parents, I will no longer help any women I do not know personally.\n\nFive years ago, if I saw a someone and yes especially if they seemed to be struggling, on the side of the road with a flat tyre, or a broken down car, I would always offer to help. Now, I do nothing I just keep driving. I don't even make eye contact with a strange woman, I'll cross the street if I must. My, let's just call her my wife otherwise it's annoying, wife has said that it isn't worth the risk and that anyone, especially women can acuse me of something and I'd just be locked up no questions asked.\n\nHer primary point is that I'm a pretty big guy, with a big beard and I don't really smile while I'm outside in public. Obviously I smile when my family, friends, or when my wife are\/is around but otherwise I do not smile so they'd just lock me up before believing anything I said. \n\nEven at work, I know where the cameras in the office are and I always now make sure that I only go down hallways that are fully covered by cctv, I moved desks to sit below a camera that doesn't move. I keep a gopro in my car just in car I get in an accident with a woman. I'll attach it and won't move. I'll have that recording and my phone recording myself constantly until the police arrive. I won't even get out of the car as I will not have my life destroyed by someone who is encouraged, enabled, and allowed to destroy a life on a whim. \n\nAnd the cameras at work thing, yeah a woman on my work team once accused me of touching her inappropriately (the only time I ever touched her was to shake her hand when I first met her). Majority of peopled instantly believed her, my boss and my team coworkers were on my side. They all said I wouldn't have done that but she kept insisting it was true and it got hard at work for me. I was openly called a rapist by multiple women and men at work! I was then asked to work from home until they decided what to do with me. Which took over a month. \n\nAt this time I admit I did contemplate suicide as my dream job was being taken away, people looked at me with disgust, I luckily had an amazing woman on my life who would ask me how I was feeling, would hug me when she knew I was down, I had friends both male and female who would just come round to sit with me and speak. So that helped me a lot. \n\nWhat saved me? Another woman on my team who happened to be recording some stuff (she was off on her honeymoon at the time of the accusation) and had asked me to help her so I was sat on camera during the time I supposedly had forced my accuser into a corner and felt her up. She told everyone a time and date and went on and on about how she checked her phone for the time once it was over. \n\nMe? I had people on my side, I had a witness that I was on tape being recorded at the time and then the accusers best friend came forward with message where she said via WhatsApp she had made it up as I never smiled at her when we walked past each other. She made it up because I didn't smile. She wanted to teach me a lesson because I should cheer up or fuck off. Her words. \n\nWhat happened? She got a promotion, pay rise, company car, an extra three week paid holiday added for emotional stress. \n\nMe? I had to have an interview with HR and was reminded that I should be more open to others in the office, because if I was this wouldn't have happened in the first place. And I was interviewed by two women one of who just kept smirking when I explained what I went through, including the moments of stupidity with the suicide stuff. \n\nYeah, I moved pretty quick to areas that were covered by cctv at all times after that. Yes, I still work there but I'm still looked at weird, but luckily I have friends who support me at work.\n\nEdit- English","created_utc":1572936428000,"comment_id":"f6k8u8h","parent_id":"t3_drf0l2","score":11,"submission_id":"drf0l2"}

{"author":"WickedClassy","body":"I don't think anyone would argue that men (not male children) are sexually assulted less often than women, but that shouldn't mean that those incidents when it does happen should simply be ignored or disregarded. Although I'm not surprised that it does, considering the current culture in the US.\n\nMy neighbor's son is 21 now, but when he was 17, he was literally raped by a girl he thought was his best friend.\n\nThe victim was of average weight and height, but the girl who raped him was probably about 5'5\" tall and easily weighed between 300 to 350 pounds. \n\nThe saddest part of the story is that the victim befriended this girl after witnessing some other guys giving her a hard time. He stuck up for her against the guys who were teasing her and then became her friend. \n\nAccording to his parents (my neighbors), everyone knew this girl had a crush on him... except him. But they all thought it was just a little crush and nothing to worry about. \n\nOne night, the girl's mother was gone and she asked my neighbor's son if he'd come and watch movies with her so she didn't have to be alone. He went over and the girl had somehow gotten a bottle of alchohol and asked him to do shots with her. \n\nThat's the last part of the story that the boy remembered. \n\nFast forward to a couple months later and the girl tells the boy that's she's pregnant with his child. He was shocked because to his knowledge they'd never had sex or even kissed for that matter. The girl tells him that after they drank the bottle of whiskey, he was laying on the couch and she started to undo his pants. She admitted that he put his hand on hers like he was trying to stop her from undoing his zipper and then he mumbled something, but she said \"I promise you'll like it\" and since he didn't respond she kept going and \"had sex with him\". \n\nHe was super upset and told the girl that she shouldn't have done that to him and said he no longer wanted to talk to her. When he told his parents, they wanted to call the police, but he said he was embarrassed that \"he'd let this happen\" and begged them not to call the cops, so they didnt. \n\nAfter that, the girl wouldn't leave him alone and after he repeatedly ignored her, she had the audacity to act like he was somehow wronging her. And once the baby was born (a girl), the rapist and her mother started running their mouths around town about how the boy, the victim, was a \"deadbeat dad\". But because the guy was so embarrassed, he never tried to defend himself or to tell people what really happened. \n\nThat situation definitely changed my perspective on this topic and it's really sad to me that this society is one where male victims feel unable to get justice.\n","created_utc":1498788368000,"comment_id":"djkfts6","parent_id":"t3_6k818v","score":113,"submission_id":"6k818v"}

{"author":"PTMegaman","body":"Never thought I'd post a comment in this subreddit, but I'm working on animated shorts related to this poster and it popped up in my r\/all so I feel compelled to respond with additional information. \n\nOur work is for a branch of the U.S. Army called S.H.A.R.P. (Sexual Harassment and Assault Response and Prevention). I've been animating short training videos for about two years now. Over the course they've included some interesting tidbits of data, including that about 2\/3 of sexual assault and harassment incidents in the army are male on male. Sexual assault isn't just physically attacking someone with the intent to have sex with them, it is filming a squadmate taking a shower without their knowledge, hazing a member of the unit by \"pantsing\" them infront of everyone, and, sadly some people need to be told this, placing an object in anyone's orifices without their consent is sexual assault.\n\nThe SARC (Sexual Assault Response Coordinator) is an active duty member who takes on the additional responsibility of being the first responder when an incident is reported, and coordinates with a VA (Victim Advocate), and an investigation is initiated. \n\nI believe heavily in this project and though I know many active duty members bemoan SHARP training as death by powerpoint, many of their peers need this training. When you become a member of an armed service you are supposed to be held the highest standard of professionalism, responsibility for your actions, and learn to work with others as a team. Many enter fresh out of highschool and do not have this skillset or understand it's necessity. You are on a team doing dangerous work and that requires a lot of trust, responsibility, and care for and from all members of the unit. Assault or harassment at one members expense can damage their trust in their battle-buddy and affects unit efficiency and readiness.\n\nHopefully a few readers will find this enlightening, encouraging, and helpful. Working the last few years on these animations tackling real issues has been incredibly fulfilling.","created_utc":1498788569000,"comment_id":"djkg0z1","parent_id":"t3_6k818v","score":8,"submission_id":"6k818v"}

Rather, we seek to expand those equal rights to include men.\n\n[These are some of the best discussions we've had](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/wiki\/discussion). There is also [a documentary made by a feminist who investigated our movement](http:\/\/theredpillmovie.com\/). If you want to know more about the issues we are concerned with, try these books: [The War Against Boys by Christina Hoff Sommers](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2000\/05\/the-war-against-boys\/304659\/) or [The Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Myth_of_Male_Power).\n\nThank you for being open minded.\n","created_utc":1505485099000,"comment_id":"dn15nic","parent_id":"t3_706n2s","score":23,"submission_id":"706n2s"}

{"author":"Afrobean","body":"Hillary Clinton's actions as a senator in 2002 were instrumental in getting Congress to approve the invasion of Iraq in 2003. And Congress is the only entity in the US who is allowed to declare war. Furthermore, she threatened to use the military against Russia last August based on the allegations that the Russian government was involved with Wikileaks somehow. Don't even get me started on her time as Secretary of State. If she had won the election, I'm confident the US military would be directly fighting Russia today. \n\nThe problem isn't the gender of the warmonger.

{"author":"mollywop","body":"But doesn't this all come from the same source? We all participate in a flawed system. Men aren't allowed to show their emotions or talk about their feelings, and they're under pressure to be $uccessful providers. This may make them more susceptible to suicide. Women open up more and are able to show their feelings and talk to their support system, but these traits are seen as weak. Women are seen as more nurturing and made for baby making = society's bias in custody battles. But these same \"rights\" for both genders screw the other over. The same logic that says women are better at rearing children and celebrating their sensitivity and \"softness\" creates bias towards them in the working world. It means they don't get hired for those dangerous labor jobs or put on the front lines, while men are seen as less valuable and tough so they fill the spots. In GWS when learning about feminism, it was never \"men have it better\". It was how both men and women, you and me, participate in a system where these beliefs and biases screw both parties. Royally, in many cases. The first step is to be aware of your participation in this system to make changes in the right direction. If a women's rights subreddit exists, they could make a poster just as believable and rage inducing as this with different stats.

How am I going to get there?\" After explaining that, of course, the company would pay for flights and all other expenses, I didn't expect what she said next: \"This job is 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. How can I be on a course in California on Monday at 9AM? I can't travel there in zero time!\"\n\nShe refused to do any travel outside working hours. Had no flexibility at all. Yet complained immediately when two other colleagues were sent to the UK for two weeks (taking an evening flight, I might add), because \"male colleagues are getting all these opportunities that I don't get\".\n\nLuckily, within less than a year, she resigned, saying \"the team never accepted me\". I guess it was \"proof of the bro culture in tech\" in her mind.","created_utc":1566778079000,"comment_id":"ey2vi5j","parent_id":"t3_cv5m2e","score":9,"submission_id":"cv5m2e"}

{"author":"dick-dick-goose","body":"In all my years, of all the penises I've seen firsthand, exactly zero have been uncut. Nobody had a foreskin. When I had my son 20+ years ago, some moms were choosing not to circumcise. It was odd to me, but I live in a part of the US that's home to people from all over the world, so I didn't question their choice no matter how odd I thought it was. I also never questioned that I would have my own son circumcised, because circumcision was the standard. It's just what I thought was normal. Becoming a mother, I was told what I'd already heard before - that circumcision was more hygienic, prevented infections, and reduced the risk of prostate cancer. Now I realize what I'd been told was something between pseudo- and quasi-science. And I have come to see the practice as the mutilation that it is. I wish I'd been presented with facts at the time, instead of lies. We're not even religious. I don't know what anyone gained from circumcising my son. All I know is that an actual piece of him was removed under false pretenses. I would never have consented to such a thing had I been informed that it wasn't necessary. If my son had grown up and decided to get cut for cosmetic purposes, that would've been his choice to make. Instead, he's never had a choice. I hope more and more boys are spared the knife each year, and more men grow up with autonomy and agency and choice.

{"author":"gramsespektrum","body":"I think we need to define feminism whenever we discuss it. I know some girls who call themselves feminist who really want female privilege instead of equality. But I also know girls who call themselves feminists who want actual equal rights between genders.\n\nIf we're bashing feminists, I feel it's important to define what we're bashing. Surely, \/r\/mensrights support equal rights?\n\n**EDIT:** Okay, I just looked up a couple of difinitions of feminism.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary says: *\"The advocacy of women\u2019s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.\"*\n\nWikipedia says: *\"...to define, establish, and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal, and social rights for women. This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities for women in education and employment.\"*\n\nI think the classic definition is pretty clear. It's about giving women the same rights as men.\n\n***EDIT 2:*** A lot of you are arguing that all feminists are crazy, that feminism is hateful, and that feminists don't want equality. I never claimed that *some* feminists aren't like that. The whole point of my post was to remind you that we need to define what feminism is, when we're criticizing it. Also, lots of women call themselves feminists without being like you guys describe them. Some of you seem to think that all women are crazy. Good luck with that.

{"author":"II-Blank-II","body":"I left my wife years ago. I still remember the night I left like it was yesterday. She always was abusive. It was embarrassing to have to go to work and see friends with black eyes and explain them away.\n\nOne night I came home from work and she smashed a plate on the counter and cut my face open. I have a deep scar to this day running down the left side of my cheek.\n\nI remember my three year old son was sitting on the floor holding his hands over his ears crying. Asking mom to stop hitting dad after she had cut my face open. I tried to take my son. But it would have put him in danger at that time because she wouldn't let me.\n\nI called the police and went downstairs with my son and locked the door. This was at my breaking point. The police came and I was escorted out of my home that I had worked so hard for. They told me no matter what the situation the male is always deemed the aggressor in domestic disputes.\n\nI wasn't allowed to take my son. I had to leave my home and possessions and live in a hotel temporarily. No one ever called me. What stings is after what she had done they had a domestic abuse counsellor contact her and gave her all the support she needed even though I had to go to the hospital with stitches and a loss of everything I ever had.\n\nThis is from my point of view how men can be treated in life. No regard for my life, my safety, my mental well being. It got far worse after that when it came to the family law when I fought and went heavily in debt just to have equal time with my son that I raised from birth (she suffered a third degree tear during labor and I raised him without her help as she was bed ridden.)\n\nI fed my son his first bottle, took a year off work, lived without money to do so to make sure I was a good father. This is how I was repaid. 50,000 dollars in debt to have equal time with my son that I deserved. Lost my home. My dog, my vehicles and almost everything I ever owned.\n\nThe only thing I got out of that poor decision of a marriage was a scar down my face and a slap in the face of what reality for some men truly is. Whenever I think of this, I always think of how proud of a father I was. I read my son books every single night and sang him to bed every single night since his birth. That kind of joy and parenting was taken from me and I will never forget that till the day I die.","created_utc":1574083690000,"comment_id":"f7xet37","parent_id":"t3_dxsjz8","score":23,"submission_id":"dxsjz8"}

No. He was unconscious? Yes. So that is most likely he didn't even know what was going on? Yes.

This is a substantial amount of wealth and should not be overlooked.\n\n[https:\/\/www.credit-suisse.com\/about-us-news\/en\/articles\/news-and-expertise\/global-wealth-report-2018-women-hold-40-percent-of-global-wealth-201810.html](https:\/\/www.credit-suisse.com\/about-us-news\/en\/articles\/news-and-expertise\/global-wealth-report-2018-women-hold-40-percent-of-global-wealth-201810.html)\n\nU.S. women in particular control about 51% of U.S. wealth or $14 trillion, which is comparable to the gross domestic products of China and India combined.\n\n[https:\/\/www.wilmingtontrust.com\/repositories\/wtc\\_sitecontent\/PDF\/Women-Investors.pdf](https:\/\/www.wilmingtontrust.com\/repositories\/wtc_sitecontent\/PDF\/Women-Investors.pdf)\n\nWow, didn't know this was what oppression looked like.\n\n>Women do more unpaid labour\n\nDo you really think one should be paid for cleaning their own house and taking care of their own children? Why should anyone else pay you for doing things that only benefits you and your family? You get paid for labour when it benefits *someone else*. Women are the benefactors of their own \"unpaid labour\" so in fact they *are* paid- they are paid in the form of the benefit produced by their own labour.\n\nYou might argue that the labour they do benefits their husbands as well, but most times the husband is working more hours at the office and paying more of the living expenses so what the husband contributes more than often covers the cost of her labour. And unless you want to start making it so that husbands are required to pay their wives a formalised wage for the \"labour\" they perform, you really have no business making this argument. (And just remember, it'll get counted under income and will be taxed accordingly).\n\n>There are almost no women that rape men\n\nPlease read some actual studies on female perpetration before you comment.\n\nThe CDC in their National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys found that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers and the form of non-consensual sex that men are most likely to experience) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.\n\nData collected by BJS under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) found that for men and boys in detention, the staff perpetrators were overwhelmingly female. Overall, among all adult prisoners reporting any type of staff sexual victimisation, 80.0% reported only female perpetrators.\n\n[http:\/\/webshare.law.ucla.edu\/Faculty\/bibs\/stemple\/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf](http:\/\/webshare.law.ucla.edu\/Faculty\/bibs\/stemple\/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf)\n\nA study called \"Sexual Coercion Context and Psychosocial Correlates Among Diverse Males\" found that 43 percent of college men and high school youth reported sexual coercion. 95 percent of the respondents identified women as the perpetrators.\n\n[https:\/\/www.apa.org\/pubs\/journals\/releases\/men-a0035915.pdf](https:\/\/www.apa.org\/pubs\/journals\/releases\/men-a0035915.pdf)\n\nSelf-reports show that women are no angels when it comes to forcing people into sex. \"Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d\n\n[https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator\/503492\/](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator\/503492\/)","created_utc":1583411142000,"comment_id":"fjj3i11","parent_id":"t3_fdodu0","score":177,"submission_id":"fdodu0"}
{"author":"LabTech41","body":"Her only real counter-argument to his position is her statement about women being the ones who are mostly raped, which isn't even true if you take into account male-on-male rape in prison.  It's just like their argument that domestic violence is a problem about men, when statistically women are the aggressors more often, and lesbian partners are the demographic with the most overall domestic violence by a wide margin, gay men the least by roughly the same amount.  It's a zombie myth that refuses to die like the wage gap, because without it feminists would have nothing to say.\n\nThe only reason that women in non-prison situations are raped more often is because rape requires the predator to physically overpower the victim, and men by and large are more physically powerful than women.  If you want to see what happens when that dynamic is flipped, just see what grown women who are given supervision of much younger males do:  every fucking day you read a brand new story of a teacher molesting, raping, and in some cases even having the children of their victims; societal pressure and the abuse makes the boys think there was nothing wrong with it, or at least not as bad as the reverse.  Bottom line:  if women and men were equal in physical ability, the rape rates would be similar, if not swung against women due to their inherent instability in this domain.\n\nEdit:  link to DV statistics [here](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=2ahUKEwil5uigk4PoAhV1lXIEHU1bB68QFjACegQIBhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwilliamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2FIntimate-Partner-Violence-and-Sexual-Abuse-among-LGBT-People.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2lrYboEJm39HRVhm1P8H9-)  (link pops up a pdf file)","created_utc":1583410573000,"comment_id":"fjj2ran","parent_id":"t3_fdodu0","score":341,"submission_id":"fdodu0"}

But because many women choose not to get in certain fields... \n   \nThings like this convert feminism and its fight for equality into \"feminazism and bullshit\".\n\n\nMen and women are different, obviously. But they have to be the same when it comes to laws, work, child custody... Equality means equality. And that's something some people find hard to understand...","created_utc":1497221363000,"comment_id":"dir7ttp","parent_id":"t3_6gkrzz","score":49,"submission_id":"6gkrzz"}

{"author":"Blitzsturm","body":"**Apparently related to an article found: [HERE](https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/katiejmbaker\/vulnerable-women-routinely-jailed-false-rape?utm_term=.wymzllBBNy#.fsP1ooDDgd)**\n\n\n> At least 200 women in the UK have been prosecuted for lying about being raped in the past decade, according to a BuzzFeed News analysis of press reports. Most of these women were sent to prison, dozens of them with sentences of two or more years.\n\nThat's actually pretty amazing.  I like the idea of lying being taboo.\n\n> Prosecutors went after teenagers, and women who reportedly had mental health issues, had experienced past physical and sexual assault, or were grappling with drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nIf anyone in these classes had stabbed someone to death I doubt they'd be shown leniency.  They are still a danger to society and can ruin other's lives.\n\n> Women were prosecuted even when they reportedly went to police only under pressure, quickly recanted, or never named their attacker at all.\n\nAll problems which can be solved by not lying about a serious crime\n\n> The CPS has prosecuted women who police were not sure had lied. In one instance detectives declined to charge the woman for making a false complaint. Prosecutors went ahead anyway.\n\nThis may be a little much.  I'd like there to be a clear indication the intention was to mislead as not to deter legitimate victims.  Under no circumstances should real victims feel fear about coming forward.\n\n> Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the influential home affairs select committee, described BuzzFeed News\u2019 investigation as \u201cvery troubling\u201d and called on the CPS to make sure the guidance is followed so that \u201cvictims are not deterred from coming forward\u201d and \u201cvulnerable women are not inappropriately prosecuted\u201d.\n\nI'd think it would be fair to need evidence of a crime to convict someone of a crime; wether that be an act of sexual assault or attempting to use the justice system to destroy someone's life.  Either way follow the evidence, and if it's substantial enough take action.  If there's no evidence, little evidence or contradicting evidence take a light touch.","created_utc":1530395891000,"comment_id":"e1jvo1m","parent_id":"t3_8uzj3l","score":22,"submission_id":"8uzj3l"}

{"author":"tenchineuro","body":"There's a lot more...\n\n* https:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2018\/08\/sarah-jeong-new-york-times-anti-white-racism.html\n\n* Is the newest member of the New York Times editorial board, Sarah Jeong, a racist?\n\n* From one perspective \u2014 that commonly held by people outside the confines of the political left \u2014 she obviously is. A series of tweets from 2013 to 2015 reveal a vicious hatred of an entire group of people based only on their skin color. If that sounds harsh, let\u2019s review a few, shall we? \u201cWhite men are bullshit,\u201d is one. A succinct vent, at least. But notice she\u2019s not in any way attacking specific white men for some particular failing, just all white men for, well, existing. Or this series of ruminations: \u201chave you ever tried to figure out all the things that white people are allowed to do that aren\u2019t cultural appropriation. there\u2019s literally nothing. like skiing, maybe, and also golf. white people aren\u2019t even allowed to have polo. did you know that. like don\u2019t you just feel bad? why can\u2019t we give white people a break. lacrosse isn\u2019t for white people either. it must be so boring to be white.\u201d Or this: \u201cbasically i\u2019m just imagining waking up white every morning with a terrible existential dread that i have no culture.\u201d I can\u2019t say I\u2019m offended by this \u2014 it\u2019s even mildly amusing, if a little bonkers. (Has she read, say, any Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson?) But it does reveal a worldview in which white people \u2014 all of them \u2014 are cultural parasites and contemptibly dull.\n\n* A little more disturbing is what you might call \u201celiminationist\u201d rhetoric \u2014 language that wishes an entire race could be wiped off the face of the earth: \u201c#cancelwhitepeople.\u201d Or: \u201cWhite people have stopped breeding. you\u2019ll all go extinct soon. that was my plan all along.\u201d One simple rule I have about describing groups of human beings is that I try not to use a term that equates them with animals. Jeong apparently has no problem doing so. Speaking of animals, here\u2019s another gem: \u201cDumbass fucking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants.\u201d Or you could describe an entire race as subhuman: \u201cAre white people genetically disposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins.\u201d And then there\u2019s this simple expression of the pleasure that comes with hatred: \u201coh man it\u2019s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men.\u201d I love that completely meretricious \u201cold\u201d to demean them still further. And that actual feeling: joy at cruelty!\n\n* ...\n\n* But the alternative view \u2014 that of today\u2019s political left \u2014 is that Jeong definitionally cannot be racist, because she\u2019s both a woman and a racial minority. Racism against whites, in this neo-Marxist view, just \u201cisn\u2019t a thing\u201d \u2014 just as misandry literally cannot exist at all.\n\nEDIT; the OP should have used the picture of her with the pink hair, she looks a lot like Big Red, and she and Big Red seem to be kindred spirits.\n\nEDIT2: Why thank you kind stranger.","created_utc":1601853792000,"comment_id":"g7orcke","parent_id":"t3_j4zhxb","score":373,"submission_id":"j4zhxb"}

{"author":"ParisHL","body":"My goodness, some of the facebook comments:\n\n**Man 1:** There's nothing like a woman scorned haha\n\n**Man 2:** If your getting beat up by your girlfriend you have a boyfriend\n\n**Woman 1:** must have been the female beating him up! its called paypack (sic)\n\n**Woman 2:** Pretty sure there is never a reason to hit a girl.\n\n**Man 3:** Violence against men should be looked at a little differently...many times the men that are victims of DV are more than capable of physically overpowering their partners but CHOOSE not too ...While under attack and while tensions are high these men still choose not to react to the violence they are the victim of but rather be controlled enough in the moment to understand that if they were to react they would then quickly become the aggressor in the situation... and turn something bad into something worse ... So it's not protection these men need it's acknowledgment, acknowledgment so other men take note and see that it is possible to be controlled and think ahead in the most heated of situations ...and that not reacting to violence unless your life is in danger is a way of rising above and essentially being a stronger and happier person .... So what I am saying is domestic violence against men should be more looked at as a group of men that have the type of self control that all men should have rather than the male version of what women endure in domestic violence situations....\n\n**Man 4:** This will be [name removed] Haha. What do u think [Tagged numerous other names]?\n\n**Woman 3:** I'm currently doing a research study into this topic (woman perpetrators of dv) so far after looking at the statistics & talking to some woman whom have been arrested, my findings so far are that some of those 1 in 5 woman have previously had an avo out on their partners in the past and on the occasion of arrest had simply had enough of a piece of paper not protecting them for the continual abuse from the male (not always physical, most often the emotional & physcholgical abuse from the male). Unfortunately for these women arrested the law does not act on other forms of dv abuse besides physical. Some of these women (not all) see themselves as standing up for themselves, their children by retaliating physically towards the male. My question to those woman was why. Some of their responses were the male was calling them belittling names, keeping money from them, abusing their children. On the other hand when male perpetrators (those that actually weren't in denial) were asked the same question, why did they physically hurt the female. Some responses were the female didn't clean the house properly, dinner was late, they went out with their friends for too long. My personal thoughts on this topic of woman as the perpetrator. Two wrongs do not make a right. However it is much more complex & not always as it looks.\n\n**Woman 4:** I have serious doubts about these figures after working for 21 years in the NSW police force. Reported assaults on males by female partners were very rare and I only ever came across one injury. None of the men were afraid of their female perpetrators but only reported on the basis that if they had hit her they would have been arrested. By comparison women were often terrified when they were assaulted by their male partners. No assaults are good but trying to pretend that men are afraid of their violent wives is, frankly, a joke.\n\n**Woman 5:** And 4 in 5 were for females...\n\n**Man 5:** LOL man up.. as if you'd let anyone touch you ESPECIALLY your woman.. #growsomeballs #girlsgonewild #trythatgetslapped\n\n**Man 6:** Judging from the one black eye he got it right the second time","created_utc":1421662567000,"comment_id":"cntejxr","parent_id":"t3_2svm1o","score":141,"submission_id":"2svm1o"}

{"author":"titan_toss","body":"I am divorced now, but my then wife abused me.  Really in more ways than one, but this is about a time she physically abused me enough to make me call the Police.\n\nWe were having an argument, per the norm, and things got a little heated. We were both in the Kitchen and I was holding my then infant son, and my daughter was at the table eating dinner.  Well, I said something that she didn't like and she punched me in the face WHILE I was holding my son, in front of my daughter.  I put my son down, walked upstairs, took pictures of the mark on cheek, and tried to cool off.  I came back down a few minutes later, and she starts going off again.  I calmly tell her that our daughter is right there watching this, and she needs to wait until later to have this discussion.  She pushes me and states that she doesnt care and that I better do whatever it was she was demanding that I do.  I again, said something (that wasn't polite, under my breath) and she started wailing on me.  I had enough, I called the cops and took pictures of the red marks all over my torso to include obvious hand prints.\n\nHere is the just of the story:\n\nThe cops arrived about 3 hours later, my wife had since left the house.  \nThey came in, asked what happened, and then asked if i HIT HER?!  \nThey didnt write a fucking thing down, and I could tell that they could care less what happened to me.  They then asked for her number, and said they will contact me later.  WTF?!\n\nThey never contacted me, they never did a damn thing, except call my wife and ask her if she was ok, and if I had hit her.\n\nEven though this is a issue that occurs 20% of the time in domestic violence cases, it is still not taken as seriously as it should be.  As a matter of fact, before we even had kids a few years earlier, we had a huge fight in which my ex broke a bunch of my valuables.  She threw my iPod in the sink, and when I went to grab it I broke a glass on accident in my haste.  She then called the cops and said i was hitting her.\nThey were there in 5 FUCKING MINUTES, handcuffed me immediately, and then took our statements.  One of THREE cops that showed up came in after a few minutes, and whispered to me, \"I'm sorry, but we have to take you in.  There is ZERO evidence on her that you even touched her, but the law is the law.\"  I went to state prison for a day, had to get bailed out for $15000, had to get an attorney (another $2000), and then got to court where the case was immediately dismissed.\n\nAnd just for context, she is in the Air Force, and I was\/am a DoD Contractor, it is not like we are some Jerry Springer couple.  \n\nTL;DR  Wife beat me, called cops, they did nothing.  She falsely accused me of DV, and I went to jail.\n","created_utc":1421715359000,"comment_id":"cntxnrv","parent_id":"t3_2svm1o","score":5,"submission_id":"2svm1o"}

Kids want alcohol, and cigarettes and any number of other things that you have to be a legal adult to get.  These laws are in place to protect our children from making decisions that they are not old enough to understand the ramifications of.  I suppose you also think a kid should be able to walk into a convenience store and buy liquor.  And that the even though it's illegal, the clerk shouldn't get in trouble \"cause the kid wanted it.\"  Jesus shit, I'm getting mad just thinking about it.  This lady knew what she was doing was illegal, immoral and *wrong* on so many levels.  \n  \nLet me ask you sicko's this. If it was your 14 year old daughter and a 30 year old man, would you say \"she wanted it\" ?  Or would you want that sack of shit hanging from a flag pole?  If you view that situation and this one differently then you are the *opposite* of what this sub is standing for.\n  \nIf you have a problem with those laws, then go lobby your congressman.  I doubt you'll get very far.  \n  \n ","created_utc":1467336828000,"comment_id":"d4u81jx","parent_id":"t3_4qmjnh","score":233,"submission_id":"4qmjnh"}

{"author":"SrBlueSky","body":"As a teacher myself, I would be lying if I said I haven't seen both male and female teachers try to instill their own philosophy into their students.  Sometimes its feminism, sometimes its their religion or poltical ideology.  The point of our job is not to indoctrinate our students, but to rather give them tools and knowledge they need to make up their own mind.  My #1 Rule of Teaching: Don't push your personal agenda on your students. Please do not blame the profession, the gender of the teachers or specific subjects for the actions of asshole teachers that break this rule.\n\nThere are many more factors (like interest in the subject) that I feel are not taken into account in this study.  I'm not disagreeing completely, male students perform worse for my female colleagues, but the opposite is true in my classes.  Removing bad teachers (like those who push feminism on their students) is always going to help.  However, I know teachers who constantly have trouble with some of their male students who do not respect them simply because they are women.  These teachers shouldn't be forced to call on a male coach every time they have an issue.  If those students would talk to their teacher and get to know them, they would have a much better time in class and their score would improve.\n\nTldr: Not all teachers are assholes.

{"author":"dbgb1986","body":"I'm amazed this isn't already a law!\n\nIt should be a federal crime to falsely accuse any person of any type of sexual crime.\n\nConsidering the LIFE-LONG stigma attached to accusations, a person who is found guilty of a false allegation of a sex crime should get a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison, with **ZERO** time off for good behavior. I don't care if the accusation in question has to do with a misdemeanor or felony or both.\n\n**Even if a man is found not guilty at trial, there will still be people who say, \"He got off on a technicality\" or \"He raped her, but the prosecutor didn't do a good enough job\" or \"He got lucky with the jury\" or \"He just had a great lawyer, so he got away with it\"!**\n\nIn other words, even if the man was a thousand miles away from the false accuser during the alleged incident, and even if there was zero contact between them ever, their entire lives, and even if no digital or electronic or email or video or Internet was used at all, and even if the accuser is proven to be lying, and even if a jury unanimously says \"THIS GUY IS 100% INNOCENT!\", the public **still** thinks of the man as a rapist. Practically speaking, **ALL** someone has to do is accuse a man of rape, and boom, automatically, half the world thinks that man is a rapist.\n\nBecause of that, I also believe that a man falsely accused of rape should receive some type of compensation that takes into account his previous jobs (if applicable), pain and suffering, mental anguish, a divorce that resulted from the accusation (if applicable), loss of the ability to find a new wife or girlfriend or husband or boyfriend (if applicable), and any other damages resulting from the false accusation.\n\nFinally, a false accuser should be **legally** required to **REGISTER** as a false accuser -- **FOR THE REST OF HIS\/HER LIFE. PERIOD. And all people on the false accuser registry should be barred from living or working within 100 yards of any school, any daycare, any park, any theater.**","created_utc":1587710902000,"comment_id":"foda0np","parent_id":"t3_g6njr9","score":7,"submission_id":"g6njr9"}

{"author":"Gambizzle","body":"I don't get angry, I just laugh. I've heard this one before so many times.  \n  \nHaving worked in prisons, it's common knowledge that women only go to prison for seriously fucked up crimes. Usually they are 'looking after' kids (while on drugs, stealing heaps of stuff, neglecting the kids, bashing people...etc) or have some other excuse like that so their sentencing is reduced significantly. Also men have a massive sense of chivalry and will go out of their way to protect women (bet you didn't know that feminists). So men often end up in prison because they don't wanna see their partner\/sibling end up in prison... whereas women are more likely to falsely dob in their partner\/brother in order to get off.  \n  \nFor a woman to be in prison long-term they'll have do have done something REALLY messed up (e.g. murder somebody or lock their kids up in a shed for 30 years and bash\/rape them regularly). I invite feminists to work with women in prisons. GOOD LUCK!!! They are much worse than the men and much more disgusting offenders. Also... look around every corner + through every window! They have a habit of putting jam jars in the microwave then cracking them over other people's faces... just because. The women's section of the prison is where you're gonna get hurt by such sly tactics. The men will just swear at you and stuff, but won't attack you from around a corner for absolutely no reason...

Equality is often only given lip service in feminism where the definition of equality always changes to paint women as victims and men as privileged.\n\nFeminists have developed a extensive toolbox to conceal their misandry. They have re-defined sexism to exclude sexism against men. They use academic-sounding language like 'patriarchy', 'toxic masculinity', and 'systemic hegemony'. They use shaming tactics like 'male fragility' or 'not all men'. They appeal to the mystical 'women's way of knowing' when their theories contradict statistics.

{"author":"Svenskbtch","body":"There is so much men and women can learn from each other. \n\nThat is not only a more benevolent, less adversarial way of putting it. It is true. \n\nWe discuss quite a bit what women can learn from men. Be less worried, but of course not unconcerned, about sexual assault. Take on more responsibility. Stop overobsessing about victimhood. Step up. Show more self confidence, but do so wisely and strategically. \n\nBut there is just as much men can learn from women. Do not be blinded by beauty, but judge the character of your partners carefully - there is mental illness out there, and with a bit of common sense, you can often spot it. Take care of yourself better - do yoga, eat healthy, learn to love yourself, ask yourself if obsessive work fulfills you. Insist on your right to be an engaged father. Avoid unnecessary risk - your safety matters. Speak out about your problems and needs without overobsessing about them.  Take care of other men just like you would women and children. \n\nThe worst thing men can do: engage in the same myopic, outraged defeatism of the kind of feminism we here, rightly but at times obsessively, criticise. Nothing good can come of that, neither for the gender debate nor for our own personal well-being. \n\nPerhaps, as a gay man, this is more clear to me than to most men.","created_utc":1575511842000,"comment_id":"f9nessn","parent_id":"t3_e60g3b","score":30,"submission_id":"e60g3b"}

{"author":"tenchineuro","body":">Author and psychologist Meredith Fuller says, \u201cThere is a societal idea that it\u2019s easy to have children, you should be able to cope and feel blessed. Abusive mothers are a very real problem and we have to start talking about it to be able to help. We have no language around it. We have made it completely impossible for a mother to say, \u2018I feel violent. I want to harm my child. I\u2019m overwhelmed and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019 **Mothers lash out because they\u2019re frustrated, angry and feel despair.

{"author":"Tsaranon","body":"The conclusion of this article troubles me. It quotes a psychologist doing what abusive people do, explaining it away as someone else's fault. \n\n> Mothers lash out because they\u2019re frustrated, angry and feel despair. They want the noise to stop, the pain to stop and they don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThe context here is that the lack of discussion of and resources for struggling mothers makes them isolated. The same ought to be said about struggling fathers. The language here reflects the same thought processes of an abusive male, and it's shifting blame off the abuser. In men, it's shouted down as what it is, excuses, and the actions are deemed unjustifiable. Why is it that we suddenly need to rally together as a community to develop support methods for it when it's a mother who is feeling these feelings?\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve created a culture where children can stand with their hands on their hips and say to their parent, \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to touch me. You can\u2019t hit me.\u2019 Parents feel powerless. \n\nVictim blaming. Flat out. It's not the abusive mother's fault, *it's the snobby kid putting her in a situation where she has no option but to hit them because she doesn't know what else to do!* Disgusting.\n\n>They can\u2019t cope and we see the result of that, but we\u2019re not willing to talk about what we can do to help before it gets to breaking point.\u201d\n\nI can agree with this, and I appreciate that the psychologist they're quoting here makes it inclusive at the end.

{"author":"vicsj","body":"This makes my fucking blood boil.\n\nI've been trying to help my boyfriend get in touch with his emotions after an abusive childhood. At one point in his life, he went numb and his go-to coping mechanism is to shove everything under the rug and never deal or confront it again. It's so harmful, and I know he hurts a lot...\n\nI've spent months upon months not being pushy and making him feel comfortable and safe enough around me to allow himself to be vulnerable with me. I've been with him for almost 3 years now, and the only time I've ever seen him cry was the day his dad died. \n\nIt would mean the world to me if he had opened up to me like this. It wouldn't make him weak or less of man. I know it would take a massive amount of courage and trust for him to do something like that. Still, I am proud of him regardless, he has done a lot of progress although he is still extremely uncomfortable with emotions. \n\nHe was raised to be a \"manly\" man.

I still let him see his son, and if he was a stable person I would share custody. When I found out I was pregnant I gave him the option to walk away (wasn't a serious relationship, and birth control failed).

{"author":"MagicTampon","body":"Correct.  Self-intoxication is not like other forms of disability. Self-intoxication is a state brought about by the intentional consumption of alcoholic beverages by an adult who knows what the consequences of drinking will be. \n\nA person who self intoxicates assumes responsibility for their self-intoxicated actions.\n\nOnly a completely morally defective jerk self-intoxicates, then holds other people responsible for their own drunken actions.  Ditto for any state that allows for incarceration on that basis.\n\nThere are those who make comparisons between civil contracts and criminal law to try to support the incarceration of counter-parties to conscious, but drunken sex. This is morally defective.\n\nBeing self-intoxicated is little excuse for much of anything of significance, because being self-intoxicated is a state induced by one's own choice and actions, for which one is ultimately accountable.  This is true in virtually all areas of law.\n\nA car salesman for example is acting in a professional capacity and has obligations that are far over and above what either party has when two people transacting as equals in a casual \/ non-business situation. Two people consensually fucking are just that -- two people with no one having more of an obligation than the other. If one is acting like a self-intoxicated drunken idiot, the other may be just as idiotic, for whatever reason, drunken or otherwise.\n\nAs much as feminists may whine otherwise, sex is not at all the equivalent purchasing shoes from a shoe salesman, where you get to return the shoes to the salesman the day afterwards if you later discover that you are unsatisfied.\n\nAnd also note, in the case of the car dealer, the drunk consumer may be entitled to a return of the car (which they may even get if they weren't drunk when they bought the car). But note, it's not considered theft of the drunk person's money, and the car salesman does not go to prison under any circumstance for theft or for any other crime. It's simply the unwinding of a fiduciary \/ civil contract (if possible), which is the most that might (or might not) occur.\n\nIf it's possible, the salesman *might* simply be required to give your your money back in exchange for the car.  Then again, he might not be.  And of course, if you ruined or trashed the car in the interim and the car is not returnable, the drunk person would be entitled to exactly jack shit.\n\nConsider it a form of restricted clemency for self-intoxicated people -- if the courts as a civil matter can unwind a transaction entered into while a person is self-intoxicated, and if the courts can unwind the transaction with a minimal of harm to the counter party, the court may choose to do so as an act of clemency.  But causing significant harm to the counter party to a self-intoxicated action, or imprisoning a counter party, is not a form of clemency for a self-intoxicated person, and is something that the court should never do.\n\nSo, in summary, a self-intoxicated person who chooses to have sex may be entitled to politely ask for their \"fuck\" back, but since that's completely impossible, they are shit out of luck.  Under no circumstances does anyone go to prison.  Because it's a tall order to send someone else to prison just because you self-intoxicated \/ jacked your own shit up and wound up choosing to do something you later regretted. That's just completely retarded.\n\nAnother illustrative example is when a 40 year-old ridiculously self-intoxicates himself \/ herself in the presence of a  15 year old.  If the 15 year-old and the self-intoxicated 40 year old then both chose to have sex with one another, guess who is going to go to jail? Not the 15 year-old -- even if the 15 year-old were a hundred times more clear-headed than the adult had been at the time. The person going to jail is the self-intoxicated 40 year-old. Why?  Because choosing to self-intoxicate is not much of an excuse for anything. You are largely responsible for anything that you do while self-intoxicated.  If you can't be held accountable, your only choice is to not drink.\n","created_utc":1500551270000,"comment_id":"dkgm57a","parent_id":"t3_6od631","score":198,"submission_id":"6od631"}

So it follows that the majority of \"can't remember rapes\" were actually consensual encounters (the alternative is they were forced rapes, which is difficult to believe).\n\nThe other kind of drunk is black out, falling over, puking into your own pints kinda drunk.

{"author":"p3ngwin","body":">**Dear teenage boy at skate park: You're probably about fifteen years old, so i don't expect you to be very mature or for you to want a little girl on your skate ramp for that matter.**\n\nWow, you really can't even hold back from the start with the sexism and prejudice eh ?  \n\nThey're fifteen, and that somehow makes them \"immature\" and can't \"accept\" a girl at the park ? You even presume they think of the park as \"theirs\", as opposed to them neutrally enjoying a public park like everyone else would. These aren't criminal gangs on home turf, they're fifteen year olds skating, at the park where they should be doing that.  \n\n>**What you don't know is that my daughter has been wanting to skateboard for months.** \n\nSo what? Why do they need to \"know\" anything about your daughter? YOU are the parent, it's YOUR job to be the guardian and satisfy her mental, and physical, needs, the rest of the world isn't obliged to consider parenting duties to your daughter. Clearly you want to world to coddle your daughter the way you feel she should be, and you think \"*it takes a village to raise a child*\" as you irresponsibly expect other people to do your role as a parent.  \n\n>**So when we walked up to the park and saw that it was full of teenage boys who were smoking and swearing she immediately wanted to turn around and go home.**\n\nYes, it's a PUBLIC place, where people are allowed to smoke and swear,a place you have no entitlement at all to how you feel the place should be enjoyed. I'm sure you wouldn't have written this if there were girls also skating and smoking, but here you are happy to rant about toxic boys and their behavior right ? \n\nYou're the type of adult who tells people they can't record video in public because \"i didn't give  you permission\". Well that would be right, because you HAVE no permission, you have no authority to give or take away from others. Other people don't \"need permission\" because it's already given in the first place by default, in the form of the right to record in public places.\n\nThe same goes for smoking in public, and swearing, you don't have to \"*put on your mom voice*\" because you don't *have* any authority to tell other people how to enjoy the freedoms of a public place. You certainly don't have any right to demand everyone in public artificially restricts their freedoms to a lowest common denominator that you decide is acceptable for your child.\n\nThese aren't teenagers smoking and swearing in a McDonalds kids cr\u00e8che, they're in a public skate park that was designed for them to enjoy.\n\n '*Censorship* is telling a man he *can*'*t* have a *steak* just *because a baby can*'*t chew it*.'  - Mark Twain\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**I secretly wanted to go home too because i didn't want to have to put on my mom voice and exchange words with you.**\n\nOh fuck off !\n\nThere's that entitlement again, you dislike the way the public enjoys the park and you feel you have the authority, \"*as a mom...*\" to condescend the teenage boys that they aren't \"welcoming\" your little girl as you feel they should ?  \n\n>**i also didn't want my daughter to feel like she had to be scared of anyone, or that she wasn't entitled to that skate park just as much as you were.**\n\nA privilege is given, and entitlement is earned. You're not entitled, you're privileged, just like the other people there.\n\n>**So when she said '*****Mom it's full of older boys*****' i calmly said '*****So what, they don't own the skate park*****'.**\n\nAgain, here you reveal yourself to be prejudice, and sexist, in how you presume how the other people at the park think and feel. You're projecting your own fears onto  your child, and creating a situation that didn't exist. What you should do as a parent is tell her the reality of the fact that many skaters are boys, but that it's irrelevant, and doesn't mean girls can't skate, or enjoy skate parks with them.\n\nIt's a shame you tried to reinforce your own prejudice, and sexism, instead of educating your child on the realities of gender preferences, such as skaters being mostly boys, just like many hospital nurses are female, etc and that even if true it's doesn't have any relation to an individual gender choosing to to be anything. But no, you told your child the boys feel \"entitled\" to the park and gave your child artificial fear, perpetuating your own insecurities on a child that had none.  \n\n>**She proceeded to go down the ramp in spite of you and your friends flying past her and grinding rails beside her.**\n\nAh the boys did things to \"spite\" her eh ? Or, maybe they were using the park as it was intended, and again, you have no right to tell other people how to enjoy public spaces. They are under no obligation to help you parent your child, that's YOUR job. \nWould you take your child a swimming pool, and complain there's a \"deep end\" that people shouldn't enjoy because it might scare your child? Or is it YOUR job to monitor your child and take them to areas, even within larger areas, that are safe for your child ?\n\nThe other skaters are not obliged to stop jumping, and grinding, just because you dislike it, in the same way you don't get to ask people to stop smoking, and swearing, in public spaces.\n\nAgain, it's not the role of other people to raise your child, so YOU have to make sure they are safe, and only experience the appropriate for them in public spaces.\n\n>**She only had two or three runs in before you approached her and said \"*****Hey, excuse me....*****\" i immediately prepared to deliver my \"*****She's allowed to use this park just as much as you guys speech*****\" speech ...**\n\nThere's that fear, sexism, prejudice just dying to burst out so you can validate your \"*mommy authority*\" complex.\n\n>**You proceeded to spend almost an hour with my daughter showing her how to balance and steer, and she listened to you, a feat no attained by most adults!**\n\nHere you admit how much of a bad parent you are, when a teenager outclassed you, because you would rather instill sexism, prejudice, and fear, into your child, yet a teenager did what you couldn't.  \n\n>**...I even heard you tell her to stay away from the rails so that she wouldn't get hurt.**\n\nYes, because again this teenager is showing how to raise your child better than you, by telling the child which parts of the public park as safe for her to enjoy. In the same way only an entitled moron expects people not use the deep-end of the swimming pool while their kid is there, and it certainly should embarrass you to watch a teenager for a moment raising your child as you should have. \n\nUnfortunately, i doubt you learned any introspection in that moment about your own individual sexism, and prejudice, let alone your failure as a parent.\n\n>**I want you to know that i am proud that you are part of the community...**\n\nYep, there's that \"*it takes a village to raise a child*\" mentality again. \n\nIt's nobody else' responsibility to raise your child, or lower their freedoms to levels that satisfy your needs in public places. It's your responsibility as a parent, or guardian, to accompany your child in public places, until they learn enough to not need supervision, so they can roam the world freely without you.\n\nOther people in public spaces are not responsible for your child.\n\n>**She left with a sense of pride and with the confidence that she can do anything, because of you.**\n\nYour daughter didn't enjoy the park, with a \"*sense of pride, and confidence*\" *because* of that teenager, she got all that *despite* your failings.\n\nIt wasn't the boy that broke out of a boundary that needed breaking, it was *you* who broke out of your presumptive, sexist, prejudice, allowing your child to benefit from the public benefits already available to her.","created_utc":1582115823000,"comment_id":"fi2riu1","parent_id":"t3_f5vff9","score":8,"submission_id":"f5vff9"}

He uses language to engage directly with the public with the aim of making the world more humane. His work has been summarised as 'art as debate'.\n\nIt a series of billboards. from his work which also [includes this billboard which says men are really great](http:\/\/www.martinfirrell.com\/powerandgender-men\/05\/image\/05.jpg)\n\n>Power and Gender (Men)  \n>  \n>6 Digital Billboards, UK, January to March 2019  \n>  \n>The Power and Gender (Men) series examines the changing archetype of masculinity, the impact of social conditioning on men's emotional responses, and the characteristics of power when held by men rather than women.\n\n'Art as debate' is obviously his justification for pushing his agenda via billboards. Billboards aren't a debate, they are a lecture.\n\n**Edit: more info about the 'art'**\n\n[http:\/\/www.martinfirrell.com\/powerandgender-men\/01\/indexm.html](http:\/\/www.martinfirrell.com\/powerandgender-men\/01\/indexm.html)\n\nMartin Firrell - All Men Are Dangerous - 2019\n\nThis text (which first appeared in a [projection by the artist](http:\/\/www.martinfirrell.com\/all-men\/00\/indexm.html) at Tate Britain in 2006) uses the term 'men' ambiguously.\n\nThe work may be advising caution in relation to men in particular (excluding women) or it may be using the word 'men' to imply all mankind.\n\nThe 'dangerousness' may be subtle and diffuse like the risk-taking that caused the financial crisis in 2008 or the growing impact of climate change.\n\nThe work includes an image of [Eugen Sandow](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eugen_Sandow) the world's first professional body builder.\n\nSandow measured the proportions of statues in museum collections in order to develop his own physique to resemble the Greek ideal.\n\nSandow's face is obscured indicating that it is the symbolism of the ideal, rather than Sandow himself, which is of interest to the artist.\n\nThis artwork is part of socialart.work, a mass public art project by public artist [Martin Firrell](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Martin_Firrell) calling for greater social justice.\n\nIt aims to create debate about power and gender, women's equality and masculinity, alternative forms of economic and social organisation, black power, and solidarity between people from different backgrounds and ethnicities.\n\nIt includes posters, publications and events supported in 2018-19 by the artist's residency with leadingOut of Home media company [Clear Channel UK.](https:\/\/www.clearchannel.co.uk\/)\n\nPart Of socialart.work\n\nMedium Digital billboard - Displayed UK, January 2019\n\nSupported by Clear Channel UK\n\nEdit2: \n\nThe billboard was based on previous work by Firrell:  [http:\/\/www.martinfirrell.com\/all-men\/00\/indexm.html](http:\/\/www.martinfirrell.com\/all-men\/00\/indexm.html) \n\n All Men Are Dangerous\n\n2016\n\nAll Men Are Dangerous was commissioned by Amy Lam\u00e9 and Duckie! for Tate Britain. The work was created originally against the backdrop of two major conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  \n\n\nThere was widespread sentiment that these wars were, in fact, essentially colonial in motivation and illegal according to international law.  \n\n\nThe work reflects on the connection between violence, belief and masculinity, and the importance of differentiating between similar sounding ideas like 'security' and 'liberty', particularly in fear-filled and politically volatile times.  \n\n\nPopular comment of the period suggested that Western populations should be prepared to sacrifice some liberties in return for greater security. This line of thinking seems more in the interests of governments than the populations they serve; there is no evidence that the sacrifice of one aspect of civil life leads to the attainment of the other.\n\nPart Of  \nAll Men Are Dangerous\n\nMedium - Projection\n\nDisplayed  - Tate Britain, 3 Feb 2006\n\nSupported by  - Tate Britain","created_utc":1579693170000,"comment_id":"ff82n41","parent_id":"t3_es4jrl","score":1,"submission_id":"es4jrl"}

By force, threat of force or when the victim is unable to consent? How would that happen?\u201d\n\nPhung: \u201cI\u2019m actually speaking to someone right now. His story is that he was drugged.

But in the audio, she kicked the door open hitting him in the head. And since doors swing into the room, that would mean Depp was in the bathroom, and she was outside blocking his exit. Then he says he was on the ground, and instead of escaping like she claims to be doing, she waits for him to get up so she can punch him in the face.\n\nThe more realistic scenario is that Depp is closing the door to the bathroom on her, she has her foot in the way and gets hit by the door. Depp bends over to check that her foot is OK, and she kicks the door open, slamming it against him and knocking him over. Then, as he\u2019s getting up, she comes into the bathroom after him and punches him in the face because her toe got hurt.","created_utc":1585438525000,"comment_id":"flqzgim","parent_id":"t3_fqg8da","score":24,"submission_id":"fqg8da"}

It\u2019s not about being responsible because you\u2019re a man, it\u2019s about being responsible because you\u2019re a fucking human being sharing this planet with other human beings who don\u2019t want to be shat on by a \u201cfew\u201d others. Men will listen to other men more than anyone else, and it\u2019s the same for women. So, YES, genders should hold their fellow members accountable. You\u2019d just let it happen and stay quiet because you don\u2019t do the same things as them? Really. I don\u2019t abuse my partner, I never have and I never will, but if I saw a woman doing it I\u2019d come down on her like a tonne of bricks. I\u2019ve done it my entire life. Even in school, I was holding other girls accountable for bullying and asking them what the fuck they thought they were doing. Why? Because I knew it was wrong! It was precisely because I didn\u2019t do the same horrible shit that I held them accountable. They fucking stopped after they realised their friends thought they were being a cunt. So why is it so difficult for others to do the same? Why, when it\u2019s made obvious that you shouldn\u2019t just sit there and let it happen, do people get offended and insulted by it? It\u2019s an easy concept to grasp, TELL PEOPLE WHEN THEY\u2019RE BEING SHIT. But no, the thought of being tarred with the same brush is apparently worse than the thought that most women you know have already been sexually assaulted, and it\u2019s continuing. It\u2019s worse than the thought that rapists are spared jail because they have promising sports careers. It\u2019s worse than the thought that kids are getting beat up for being \u201ceffeminate\u201d, for not being masculine enough, and people fucking film it. You\u2019re so ready to hold women accountable for things other women have done, but you can\u2019t hold another man accountable because you don\u2019t want to be responsible just because you\u2019re also a man ... and because you don\u2019t want to put all men together ... but you\u2019re fine with lumping all women together.

Really, a lot of society likes it this way. \n\nI hate to be \"that guy\", but it makes it easier to control you when you don't understand your emotions. Easier to manipulate. \n\nIf you get pissed off every time someone mentions your ex-wife, then it's easy to use that information against you. \n\nIt's in women's selfish short term interests to keep adult men emotionally stunted. \n\nLong term, it's not good for anyone. \n\nIt's insanely frustrating to me to see men villainized before they even do anything wrong. \n\nIf you make men work the hardest and get the least emotional support for their contributions to the family, then a few of them go off the deep end and get violent. \n\n\nI would prefer we focus on preventing violence by being more supportive of men and their emotions BEFORE they feel desperate and lash out. \n\nIf we want to talk about unhealthy versions of the ideal man in media, then it's all over the place.

{"author":"jostler57","body":"THIS IS A COPY\/PASTE FROM THE WEBSITE, SHOULD YOU NOT WANT TO VISIT THE SITE:\n\nFacebook Is Banning Women for Calling Men \u2018Scum\u2019\nWomen had accounts banned from Facebook for responding to male trolls with sentences like \u2018men are trash,\u2019 in part because the company classifies white men as a protected group.\nTaylor Lorenz\n12.04.17 12:00 AM ET\n\nWhen comic Marcia Belsky sarcastically replied \u201cmen are scum\u201d to a friend\u2019s Facebook post back in October, she never anticipated being banned from the platform for 30 days.\n\nThat was exactly what happened.\n\nBelsky was shocked at the severity of the punishment considering her relatively innocuous comment, and immediately spoke to her fellow female friends about the ordeal. They could relate.\n\nIn the wake of the #MeToo movement, countless women have taken to Facebook to express their frustration and disappointment with men and have been promptly shut down or silenced, banned from the platform for periods ranging from one to seven days.\n\nWomen have posted things as bland as \u201cmen ain\u2019t shit,\u201d \u201call men are ugly,\u201d and even \u201call men are allegedly ugly\u201d and had their posts removed. They\u2019ve been locked out of their accounts for suggesting that, since \u201call men are ugly,\u201d country music star Blake Shelton \u201cwinning the sexiest man isn\u2019t a triumph.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally posted men are scum in November and I received a seven day ban. It\u2019s still ongoing. Two days and 23 hours left,\u201d said comedian Alison Klemp.\n\nKayla Avery, a comedian in Boston said she\u2019s been banned close to 10 times by Facebook and is currently serving out the end of her third 30-day ban.\n\nOne of the first times she got banned was when her page was flooded with male trolls calling her derogatory and sexist terms. Avery posted \u201cmen continue to be the worst\u201d she said, because she said she \u201cfelt helpless to stop their hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was one guy who was threatening to find my house and beat me up,\u201d she said. \u201cI got banned before I could even successfully report it.\u201d\n\nIn late November, after the issue was raised in a private Facebook group of nearly 500 female comedians, women pledged to post some variation of \u201cmen are scum\u201d to Facebook on Nov. 24 in order to stage a protest. Nearly every women who carried out the pledge was banned.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best protest because it clearly didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Klemp. Avery said she is still suffering the consequences after posting \u201cmen are trash\u201d on that day.\n\nOn Nov. 28 a Twitter thread by comedian Rae Sanni documenting her experience of being banned by Facebook went viral and countless other women began to share their stories.\n\nThe problem has become so widespread that Avery even created a website to document these women\u2019s tales. The site, FacebookJailed.com, shares women\u2019s experiences of being punished by Facebook for making benign comments about men or standing up to trolls, sometimes juxtaposed with Facebook\u2019s inaction against men who have hurled insults or racial slurs back.\n\n\u201cComedian and writer Rae Sanni has been targeted by nazi trolls who hurled dozens of threatening and violent messages and comments at her for days,\u201d a recent post reads. \u201cRae Sanni was banned by Facebook while her abusers are free to say sh*t like this without being in violation of community standards.\u201d\n\nThe post features screenshots provided by Sanni where Facebook does not deem comments calling her the N-word hate speech.\n\nWhen reached for comment a Facebook spokesperson said that the company is working hard to remedy any issues related to harassment on the platform and stipulated that all posts that violate community standards are removed.\n\nWhen asked why a statement such as \u201cmen are scum\u201d would violate community standards, a Facebook spokesperson said that the statement was a threat and hate speech toward a protected group and so it would rightfully be taken down.\n\nAs ProPublica revealed in an investigation in June, white men are listed as a protected group by the platform.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson clarified that this is because all genders, races, and religions are all protected groups under Facebook\u2019s current policy. However, it\u2019s clear that even with 7,000 Facebook content moderators, things slip through the cracks.\n\nFemale comedians have speculated that it\u2019s internalized misogyny on the behalf of Facebook\u2019s content moderation team that leads to punishment such as banning to be doled out unequally. Several have tried posting \u201cwomen are scum,\u201d had their friends report the posts, and subsequently suffered zero consequences.\n\nWhile this explanation is tidy, it\u2019s almost certainly false. Facebook employees receive extensive training around specific issues and their work is regularly reviewed to account for any personal biases.\n\nBut the system is far from perfect.\n\nOne issue with the way Facebook moderators currently review posts is that many \u201cproblematic\u201d posts are viewed individually, without context because of privacy concerns. Facebook moderators also aren\u2019t able to view personal or demographic information about the original poster. This means that they sometimes don\u2019t know whether a piece of content was posted by a black queer woman or a white straight male.\n\nIt also means the moderators don\u2019t know whether the poster has a history of spreading messages related to white supremacy, or has participated in targeted harassment campaigns against specific groups before.\n\nWith hate speech in particular, the person writing the post is just as relevant as what is being said. The fact that Facebook\u2019s moderators aren\u2019t always given this information means that sometimes benign statements can be misinterpreted, and vice versa.\n\nContext also matters. One reason female comics often seem to run afoul of Facebook\u2019s guidelines is that the company\u2019s content moderators fail to recognize the humor in their posts. Popular tropes such as \u201cban men\u201d are interpreted literally under Facebook\u2019s current set of community standards, and women suffer the consequences for attempting to express themselves.\n\nIn the past, ironic misandry has been a popular way for women to deal with living in a world where they\u2019re exposed to frequent abuse at the hands of powerful men. Yet, if a woman takes to Facebook to vent about how she \u201cwants to imprison men and milk them for their male tears,\u201d she could quickly lose access to her account.\n\nTrolls know this. \u201cThe ironic thing about Literal Nazis is that they have weaponized taking things literally,\u201d BuzzFeed writer Katie Notopoulos wrote recently.\n\nFeigning outrage at statements that were clearly not written to be interpreted that way has become a favored tactic of the alt-right, Gamergate, and movements known for their coordinated harassment efforts. When moderators can\u2019t make this distinction they punish innocent parties and embolden trolls.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at ways to apply our policies in a more granular way... But we are a global platform.\u201d\n\u2014 Facebook spokesperson\n\nMeanwhile, outright false and defamatory information\u2014like Pizzagate communities accusing private citizens of pedophilia because of their political beliefs\u2014still thrive on the service.\n\nFacebook\u2019s spokesperson stressed that they were working on a fix to this and added that the company plans to \u201clook at ways to apply our policies in a more granular way, for instance to take into account the history of oppression with different genders and ethnicities, etc. when reviewing posts. But we are a global platform.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, two women who are both not in the comedy world but have had their content flagged or removed said the bans have made them feel much less comfortable posting on Facebook about sensitive topics like the #MeToo movement.\n\nAvery said that posting on Facebook, no matter what issue, can feel like walking across a minefield.\n\n\u201cI get cold feet to post stuff, especially if I try to share something that\u2019s going on that I want to bring attention to. because I feel like I\u2019m going to get in trouble somehow,\u201d she said. \u201cSharing anything is nerve racking. It\u2019s like, \u2018What\u2019s ok? What\u2019s not ok? What\u2019s going to cross the line this time?\u2019 It makes me feel crazy, like Facebook is gaslighting us.\u201d\n\nHeather Fink, also a female comedian, said the problem has also begun to spread to Instagram. She has had several posts there removed where she said she was simply talking about her Facebook ban and now no longer trusts the platform to ensure her voice is heard.\n\nThe #MeToo movement has been perpetuated via social media thanks to the open nature of most platforms and the ability for women to speak out publicly in their own words. If Facebook\u2019s community guidelines are being enforced irregularly, whether intentional or not, women say it stifles their ability to speak truth to power and share their stories.\n\u201cFacebook is absolutely silencing women.\u201d\n\u2014 Heather Fink\n\n\u201cSocial media is how we communicate. Preventing women from expressing themselves like this is an intimidation tactic,\u201d said Meredith, a social-media strategist who has had several of her friends banned.\n\n\u201cThis feels like a deliberate and systematic act\u2014and whether it was or it wasn\u2019t, it needs to be addressed publicly by Facebook and Instagram, especially as we\u2019ve seen plenty of examples of true, dangerous hate speech remaining on these platforms even after being reported.\u201d\n\nAvery said Facebook\u2019s banning policy itself ties into the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cHow else can we have a genuine reaction to what\u2019s going on?\u201d Avery said. \u201cFacebook is absolutely silencing women.\u201d","created_utc":1512430690000,"comment_id":"dqr2z9l","parent_id":"t3_7hgvvm","score":45,"submission_id":"7hgvvm"}

{"author":"HeForeverBleeds","body":"This [isn't the first time](https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/india\/Activists-oppose-making-rape-gender-neutral\/articleshow\/15049606.cms), or [second](https:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/news-ians\/sc-junks-plea-for-gender-neutral-rape-molestation-law-118020201543_1.html), that gender neutral rape laws have been opposed by people who insist that female victims should be prioritized over male victims. Though I'm not sure if this law would even be entirely gender neutral or if it would just include male-on-male rape and not also female-on-male\n\nThe way it's currently worded\n\n>Any **person** who forces a *person of the female sex* by threats or violence, psychological pressure or by being made incapable of resistance to submit to sexual intercourse...\n\nI hope that it will include both, and that the only change will be for \"a person of the female sex\" to be changed to \"a person\". However the article says\n\n>Under the current law, homosexuel men cannot be judged victims of rape\n\nimplying it's only talking about male-on-male rape (also implying that only homosexual men can be raped...)\n\n>he feared the definition of rape would become a hotchpotch notion that would weaken the protection of female victim\n\nIf he thinks including male victims will make people take rape less seriously, then the issue isn't the definition of rape. The issue is the phenomenon of people not taking rape against men seriously\n\n>the consequences are worse for women because of the risk of pregnancy. Fehlmann Rielle reacted strongly to this remark saying that focusing on the issue of pregnancy minimises the rape of those who are not of child bearing age\n\nExactly right. No one's going to say raping a pre-pubescent girl or an elderly woman is not as bad because she can't become pregnant. In addition, there's child support in Switzerland as well and I'm pretty sure that, like every where else, they don't make exceptions for if the man was forced into it\n\nThe risk of becoming pregnant and the risk of being financially drained for 18 years are both serious consequences victims of either sex can face as a result of rape.

{"author":"Meonspeed","body":"Visitor from r\/all here, this is one area where I agree with you guys. When I had an accidental pregnancy I actually did give the father the choice to be involved or not. I did not believe in abortion but, especially since it was my birth control fuck up, I didn't think it was fair to force him into fatherhood. I got allll kinds of shit for that decision, especially for not pursuing child support since \"that is what your daughter deserves!\" which to some extent I agree with in theory, but I wouldn't have gone through the pregnancy if I couldn't take care of her on my own. She has all her needs taken care of, goes to private school, has a college fund and still people will say I'm selfish for not going after her biological dad for whatever money I could squeeze out of him. He makes significantly less than I do and lives thousands of miles away, so he couldn't have custody even if he wanted it. As it stands my daughter, now almost a teenager, has a good albeit casual relationship with her bio dad, visits with him a couple times a year, and my husband has been able to adopt her with zero drama on either side. I don't see how the situation would be improved by forcing my ex into parenthood. I have seen other people I know in protracted custody battles, constantly at odds with their ex over child support and all the drama that goes along with it, and I feel so grateful that I don't have to deal with that crap- or, more importantly, that my daughter isn't subjected to it. \n\n","created_utc":1529319067000,"comment_id":"e0uo6to","parent_id":"t3_8rsxy1","score":215,"submission_id":"8rsxy1"}

Women have all the privilege in the world but try to falsely frame as they are completely hopeless in a world that doesn't care for them. Women have been trying to complain about gender pay gap which when you compare like for like disappears and furthermore shows that unmarried women out-earn unmarried men. Women say that there are few women in politics, when actually it is more of a supply problem. Women complain that there are few women in STEM, which is again a supply problem as women don't necessarily enjoy dealing with STEM subjects on average in the masses. Women already have had the right to vote 100 years ago. Women say they feel unsafe walking around alone late a night, even though the statistics show that men get murdered more often than women out in the streets. Women complain about not being able to abort, this is a debate that will last a long time because after a certain the fetus becomes a baby which is a human separate to that of the women, and it is not their 'their body their choice' anymore - and aborting means murder, which is not a fair right to have except in extreme circumstances like rape.

Little is known, however, about sexual orientation differences in orgasm frequency. We examined how over 30 different traits or behaviors were associated with frequency of orgasm when sexually intimate during the past month. We analyzed a large US sample of adults (N = 52,588) who identified as heterosexual men (n = 26,032), gay men (n = 452), bisexual men (n = 550), lesbian women (n = 340), bisexual women (n = 1112), and heterosexual women (n = 24,102). Heterosexual men were most likely to say they usually-always orgasmed when sexually intimate (95%), followed by gay men (89%), bisexual men (88%), lesbian women (86%), bisexual women (66%), and heterosexual women (65%). Compared to women who orgasmed less frequently, women who orgasmed more frequently were more likely to: receive more oral sex, have longer duration of last sex, be more satisfied with their relationship, ask for what they want in bed, praise their partner for something they did in bed, call\/email to tease about doing something sexual, wear sexy lingerie, try new sexual positions, anal stimulation, act out fantasies, incorporate sexy talk, and express love during sex. Women were more likely to orgasm if their last sexual encounter included deep kissing, manual genital stimulation, and\/or oral sex in addition to vaginal intercourse. We consider sociocultural and evolutionary explanations for these orgasm gaps. The results suggest a variety of behaviors couples can try to increase orgasm frequency.\n\nFrederick, D. A., John, H.

It's the perfect place for your average man hating tumblr girl. I'm fathomed that the waiters there got a green light to mostly talk to the woman and treat her as the table leader(because apparently a man who also orders food and drinks for the lady is a sexist thing today? Lol Hashtag Snowflake Era is Upon us). Moreover, apparently when men try to talk they either get fully ignored or are told to let the lady talk which is just incredibly sexist.\n\nI was dumbfounded when I read that not only do you get treated like a second or third class citizen, the waiters are also fully allowed to throw sexist remarks or just plain bad insults towards men with a condescending tone. Holy shit.\n\nWho on planet earth decided \"I hate men so much, I'll open a cafe and implement such a sever level of segregation and misandry, men will probably avoid the street, not only the bar. Yeah, it will sell like hotcakes!\"?\n\nMOST reviews are saying the same thing: Sexist, Misandryst, Hateful, Men get treated extremely poorly while women get treated like godesses. The only \"good,recommending it\" reviews are from extremely sexist feminists that think this is normal or families who got treated well BECAUSE they brought a child to the table and at least the waiters had the decency to hold their sexist remarks in front of them.\n\nIt's funny seeing that a lot of reviews are from women stating just how stupid this is.\n\nI'm glad the business went down the drain. With the risk of sounding defiant, I hope somebody wrote a list with all the employees there and added them to a blacklist of potential employees somewhere. If I owned a restaurant\/cafe in AU, I'd be willing to pay 4 digits for the list of names with personal details to just outright ban them from entering the locale or ever have a chance of working under me.

{"author":"JudDredd","body":"Double standards aren\u2019t ok so why does this one exist?\nPart of it is that women\u2019s sexuality\/desire has only recently been permitted and acknowledged so lots of acts of overt sexuality are seen as empowering or progressive. \nMen\u2019s desire has been the opposite. \nI suppose time and conversations like this will ultimately create new norms that aren\u2019t so dependent on gender. \nThe real question is, all things being equal, what is the right thing to do? Is it ok to take a PG photo of a celebrity or sports person changing clothes? \nProbably depends on the implied consent of the sports person and in the case where someone is changing in public then I would say consent is usually implied. \n\nThe only example I can think of with genders reversed was the Joe Rogan ogling Rhonda Rousey at a weigh in video. Mostly he was seen as tacky but also human? I dunno. Thanks \n\nEdit. Another reason why this double standard exists is that there is an assumption that, as a man, it\u2019s more likely that he is happy to be sexualised and that more men in general would appreciate being desired. \nIt\u2019s easier to assume that this sports man would be consenting than it would be for a sports woman doing the same thing.

The Government\u2019s own analysis shows that they lead to higher rates of reoffending than community sentences, and the President of the Prison Governors Association has described them as \u201cpointless\u201d.* **They need to end for both men and women.** \n\nFair enough...\n\n \n\n>*But we also need to recognise that prison is especially damaging for women.*  \n>  \n>*Most women in prison are vulnerable people. The majority experienced abuse as a child, and many are survivors of domestic abuse as adults. They are more likely than male prisoners to have poor mental health or problems with alcohol and drugs.*\n\nHang on, what the fuck?\n\nSince when do both genders who suffer the same problems, suddenly mean we need to **not** apply this to men, instead take care of the women at men's expense ?? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> *To make matters worse, two thirds of women in prison are mothers of dependent children, and at least a third of these are single parents. Separating them from their children has a harsh impact on their welfare, going far beyond the intended punishment of imprisonment itself.* \n\nErm, if the \"mother\" is a criminal, why is she somehow still considered a fit mother ?\n\nShe loses custody, the kid goes to the father, or if the father isn't fit either, foster care is a thing you know, for the benefit of the child right ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> *And just think about the 17,000 children who are separated from their mothers each year, because their mothers are sent to prison.*  The vast majority of them are moved out of their homes as a result. Just think about the damage that does to the child\u2019s development and wellbeing, as well as the pressure it puts on already stretched public services. \n\nHow about we spare a thought instead for the 17,000 children who are separated from their **FATHERS** each year, because their **FATHERS** are sent to prison?\n\nbut hey, fuck men right, keep the child with the mother, even if she's a criminal and a fit father is available outside prison ?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> *Having a parent in prison is a traumatic experience for a child, and can have strong detrimental effects throughout their life. \u201cAdverse Childhood Experiences\u201d such as this increase the risk of developing physical and mental health problems, from liver disease to depression and alcoholism, as well as poor performance at school and involvement in violence.* \n\nAbsolutely, but funny how this has been happening the whole time when FATHERS went to prison, but you only care now because WOMEN are affected, so use the ol' \"*won't you please think of the children!?*\" argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> *It is vital, therefore, that the best interests of children are taking into account when making decisions about whether to send their mothers to prison.* \n\nOnce again, fuck FATHERS right ?","created_utc":1583315823000,"comment_id":"fjf9arg","parent_id":"t3_fd2c93","score":333,"submission_id":"fd2c93"}

{"author":"Imnotmrabut","body":"|Male Circumcision: Pain, Trauma and Psychosexual Sequelae|\n|:---|\n|Ramos and Boyle (2001) investigated the psychological effects associated with medical and ritual \"operation tuli\" circumcision procedures in the Philippines. **Some 1577 boys aged 11 to 16 years (1072 boys circumcised under medical procedures; 505 subjected to ritual circumcision) were surveyed to see if genital cutting led to the development of PTSD.** Interestingly, Mezey and Robbins (2001) estimated the incidence of PTSD as 1.0% to 7.8% in the general British population where circumcision is not very prevalent. On the other hand, **using the PTSD-I questionnaire (Watson et al., 1991) in a predominantly circumcised population, Ramos and Boyle observed an incidence of PTSD of almost 70% among boys subjected to ritual circumcision, and 51% among boys subjected to medical circumcision (with local anaesthetic). Long-term follow-up would be needed to gauge the extent to which PTSD persists over the lifespan of these circumcised boys.**|\n||\n|The outcome of painful childhood trauma includes long-lasting neurophysiological and neurochemical brain changes (Anand & Carr, 1989; Anand & Scalzo, 2000; Ciaranello, 1983; Taddio et al., 1997; van der Kolk & Saporta, 1991). Richards, Bernal, and Brackbill (1976) found that **circumcision may impact adversely on the developing brain, and that reported \"gender differences\" may actually arise from behavioural changes induced by infant or childhood circumcision.**||\n||\n|Rhinehart (1999) **in a report of adult clinical cases concluded that a man circumcised as a child is more likely to react with terror, rage and\/or dissociation when confronted with situations interpreted as threatening. As in any situation of post-traumatic stress, an event resembling any aspect of the original traumatic experience is more likely to provoke negative emotions such as panic, rage, violence, or dissociation.**||\n||\n|**It is therefore not surprising that PTSD may result from childhood circumcision** (Goldman, 1997, 1999, Menage, 1999; Ramos & Boyle, 2001), just as it does from childhood sexual abuse and rape (Bownes, O'Gorman, & Sayers, 1991; Deblinger, McLeer, & Henry, 1990; Duddle, 1991). Several researchers have concluded that PTSD may result from circumcision and\/or from circumcision-related sequelae in later life. For example, Rhinehart (1999) reported **finding PTSD in middle-aged men who had been subjected to infant circumcision.** Circumcision involves an imbalance of power between perpetrator and victim, contains both aggressive and libidinal elements, and threatens a child's sexual integrity by amputating part of the genitalia. **Some men circumcised in infancy or childhood without their consent have described their present feelings in the language of violation, torture, mutilation, and sexual assault** (Bigelow, 1995; Hammond, 1997, 1999).|\n|**Boyle, Gregory J., et al. \"[Male circumcision: pain, trauma and psychosexual sequelae.](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/y7vzmzzx3wl7j7b\/Boyle%2C%20Gregory%20J.%2C%20et%20al.%20%22Male%20circumcision%3A%20pain%2C%20trauma%20and%20psychosexual%20sequelae.%22%20Journal%20of%20Health%20Psychology%207.3%20%282002%29%3A%20329-343.%20fulltext.pdf?dl=0)\" Journal of Health Psychology 7.3 (2002): 329-343.**|","created_utc":1510031768000,"comment_id":"dpfywdf","parent_id":"t3_7b42yq","score":7,"submission_id":"7b42yq"}

I don't think this is a war against masculinity.  This is a war against the \"toxic\" part of \"toxic masculinity\".

{"author":"ggihhpy","body":"Maybe we can approach this issue from a different angle.  Right now feminists aren't for opening up the selective service to women because the only way the program is incentivized is through a disincentive.  In other words, if a man doesn't register he's subject to several penalties.  So opening up the selective service program to women basically means you're opening non-compliant women to penalties if they don't register.  \n\nWhat about an actual incentive:\n\nMen who register get $100 added to their tax return every year they are eligible to be drafted.  You can be drafted from age 19 - 26 so that would be $700 total for every registered person in the US.  \n\nShouldn't we all be getting something for being willing to put our asses on the line in defense of this country?

{"author":"SaintBio","body":"This study seems really weak. Be careful with what you draw from it as 'fact'. You shouldn't blindly follow any study, even if it's conclusions support your worldview, until you look at the methodology. A few problems I caught:\n\n* The study only looked at federal sentencing. This is problematic on two levels. First, federal crimes are an extreme minority. In 2017, there were 1,719 state prisons compared to 102 federal prisons. Out of the 2.3 million people incarcerated in the USA, only 225,000 are in Federal prisons. That's not even 10% of the prison population. In addition, around 32% of federal prisoners are not even American, they're in federal prison for immigration offences or things like terrorism, hijacking, espionage, etc. So, the study tells us absolutely nothing about the actual sentencing of 90% of people in the criminal justice system.\n\n* The second problem with the federal crimes aspect of the study is that federal sentencing guidelines are all kinds of fucked up. It basically goes by a scale from 1-43. Each type of crime is assigned a base offense level, which is the starting point for determining the seriousness of a particular offense. More serious types of crime have higher base offense levels (for example, a trespass has a base offense level of 4, while kidnapping has a base offense level of 32). It's hard to understand what this professor did in the study, but it looks like she simply used the base offence code to compare\/contrast sentences. For instance, she indicates: \"All case type exclusions were based on the ***USMS arrest code***.\" The problem is that the arrest code tells us effectively nothing vis-a-vis the actual severity of the crime committed. By way of an example, if someone were arrested for robbery, they would have a base level of 20. Which I believe is a Zone D sentence with a range of 33-41 months in prison. However, if that robbery was committed with a firearm, it gets bumped up to a 25. If the firearm was discharged, it's now a 27. If the offender subsequently obstructed justice, it's now a 29. It's even worse if they have a criminal history. That 29, with a criminal history of 2 previous crimes becomes a 107-121 month sentence. So, we went from a 33-41 month sentence, to a 107-121 month sentence. Both for the same crime. The aggravating\/mitigating factors alone can produce a 6 point rise or fall in your offence level. \n\nShe even recognizes this problem when she indicates that, \"The arrest offense is not a perfect proxy for underlying criminal conduct.\" She tries to explain it away but this is probably the weakest part of her paper. I would have really liked her to explore the unobserved differences in crime severity more than she does in the few paragraphs she dedicates to it.\n\n* In the study, she also writes: \"The USMS codes are based on the principal arrest offense and may exclude some secondary criminal conduct (although in most cases, because concurrent sentencing is the\ndefault rule, secondary conduct will not affect the sentence).\" This is really misleading. Concurrent sentences do affect the sentencing because judges will typically assign a longer sentence to the principle offence because they know the other offences will be served concurrently, and they consider it akin to an aggravating factor. So, essentially, what the study has done is it has not distinguished in its data between people who were arrested for multiple crimes, and people arrested for one crime. This inevitably upends their results because it makes it look like one person got a much longer sentence for the same crime as someone else, when the reality may simply be that that person was arrested for committing 2 or more crimes and that's why they got a longer sentence on their principle. But, we'll never know because the study ignored that possibility.","created_utc":1544965988000,"comment_id":"ebw5o5y","parent_id":"t3_a6i4tn","score":53,"submission_id":"a6i4tn"}

{"author":"Lhtfoot","body":"As a man who is dealing with a woman who is violating her custody order on a weekly-basis, it begins to take it's toll. You get really tired of spending 2 hours at the police-station every other night, filing domestic incidence reports. You eventually let some of these injustices slide, because you just want a break from all the drama. I imagine that was the case with this guy, as the woman is described as a perpetual screw-up. This guy was probably sick of the process and tried to cut-corners by pushing his way in. Not smart, but I understand it... I recently read an article saying that more men have killed their spouses over custody disputes last year than U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq since 9\/11. Think about that... Are these men all psycho-killers? Or is it more likely they are just normal men, put in desperate and emotionally torturing situations and no one listens to them or helps them? They eventually break and snap... I know, because I fight the urge to do \"something stupid\" on a daily basis. The injustice I have been shown sets my blood to a boil immediately upon waking. Every instinct in your body is telling you to protect your child. But your brain is telling you that you will never see them again if you do \"something stupid\". So you remain torn and defeated until something gives... And hopefully, it's not your composure that gives before the courts do.

How about if I said \"Until black girls prove to me they're worth more than a faded fuck, I refuse to take these fuckgirls seriously anymore.\"\n\nRacism. Check. Sexism. Check.\n\nIt's so weird when some people analyze their interactions as driven by gender and race, and then not realize that they are acting based on gender and race more than any other people around them.\n\nPersonally, I'm also Asian, and I can't think of a single interaction with my largely white company and city that I can attribute to my race.

{"author":"asdfaw3tr","body":"Fucking White Girls\n\nIt was about 2 a.m. when Sam and I walked down the empty hallway, passing by the painted murals and the bedrooms of my snoring housemates.\n\nWe had been eye fucking each other all night, and the sexual tension had built to a point where neither of us could contain our cheeky smiles.\n\nAs we turned the corner, we met face to face. Already knowing the answer, I put my arms around her neck and bluntly asked, \u201cCould I kiss you?\u201d\n\nWhat happened next was an instant exchange of sexual desire \u2014 without a thought, our lips and pelvises pressed up against each other as we made out against the thin co-op walls.\n\nI led the way to my bedroom as we quietly snuck past the room she was supposed to be staying in, past the housemate she was supposed to be fucking. Was it luck that he had conveniently left her alone for a couple hours, or had I really mastered the art of seduction?\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter because on my flowery bedspread, under the twinkly string lights, it was a race to get naked. I untied my white blouse as she helped unbutton it. We pulled off her sweater, and as I sat on top of her, feeling her stiff, denim jeans, I relished in the success of my sexual pursuit. It wasn\u2019t until I began to unbuckle her belt that I noticed the hesitancy in her big blue eyes.\n\n\u201cI feel bad,\u201d she said.\n\nShe revealed to me that she had been hooking up with my housemate, and while they hadn\u2019t talked about labels, she supposedly didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.\n\nExasperated by her timing, I removed myself from her lap, taking a moment to formulate my response.\n\nSeveral weeks before, I confronted my housemate after I found out that we had both slept with Sam. In our rather casual conversation, we marveled at how her slutty reputation didn\u2019t seem to match her quiet, passive demeanor. Although we were both warned by our friends that she had a history of being shitty to men, we were, after all, cooperative and sex-positive housemates. We encouraged the other person to \u201cgo for it\u201d \u2014 even though I knew his \u201cquirky\u201d Wes Anderson aesthetic meant he was more likely seen as boyfriend material.\n\nObviously, I knew about everything, so I was a little confused as to why she was telling me all of this; was it my responsibility to stop her from hurting my housemate?\n\nI decided that it wasn\u2019t, and I simply told her, \u201cI really don\u2019t fucking care.\u201d I\u2019ve seen my fair share of sluts, and if she was going to be a slut, I wasn\u2019t going to be the one to comfort her guilt.\n\nMaybe this turned her on because despite her earlier hesitation, we promptly continued hooking up. My fixation with pleasing her turned into this endless cycle where Sam would stop and tell me that she \u201cfelt bad\u201d even though we would continue to touch each other anyway.\n\nI eventually grew bored of dry humping, and as I became increasingly aware of her faulty understanding of loyalty \u2014 and her wet vagina \u2014 the whole situation became kind of humorous to me. I cynically told her that I didn\u2019t know she had feelings, to which she responded she was trying to have fewer of them. I told her she had such a great moral conscience.\n\nI didn\u2019t waste my time trying to be nice anymore because I was aware of what I had become: the irrelevant Asian guy in a budding Scott Pilgrim-esque romance. From the countless times that I\u2019ve been rejected for a white guy, I\u2019ve been taught that my desirability was only a fleeting moment whereas a white boy was the one worth getting to know, the one worth bringing home to parents and the one worth being treated as a human. I was the sexual object, whereas my housemate was the one who had feelings worth considering.\n\nEventually, I showed Sam out the door, and she asked for my number, suggesting that maybe we could \u201chang out\u201d next semester when our lives were a little bit different.\n\nFuck that. I\u2019m wise enough \u2014 or have been fooled enough times \u2014 to recognize that this \u201cmaybe one day\u201d trope was a slut specialty. To objectify men like they\u2019re library books, pulling them on and off the shelf whenever it\u2019s convenient \u2014 and for men to be OK with that \u2014 is a clear example of female privilege.\n\nIt\u2019s depressing to realize how much men of color compromise in their relationships with white girls. I recall the number of times that my non-white guy friends and I have praised a white girl for having listened to us, for having genuine interest in us, for seeing us as a real people instead of objects. It\u2019s fucked up that these are exceptions and not expectations.\n\nWhen society has made the white person the ultimate pursuit, it teaches non-white men to be OK with feeling inferior, to be OK with being submissive and to be OK with being treated like shit.\n\nUntil white girls prove to me they\u2019re worth more than a faded fuck, I refuse to take these sluts seriously anymore.\n\nSomeone who isn't a pussy please submit this as an op-ed to the paper that published this: http:\/\/www.dailycal.org\/2016\/06\/30\/361455\/.  I didn't do anything but swap the genders, and the word 'fuckboy' for 'slut'.","created_utc":1467419190000,"comment_id":"d4vi6uk","parent_id":"t3_4qrgwv","score":30,"submission_id":"4qrgwv"}

{"author":"UCLoon7","body":"I\u2019ve lurked in the sub for a little while now.  When I first heard of \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d it sounded like a right wing reactionary protest, just more political bs.  I think I\u2019m the typical \u201cyou just need to suck it up\u201d guy.\n\nHowever, I see that\u2019s not what this is.  This is young men being falsely accused of rape, false claims of domestic violence, fathers separated from their children, etc.\n\nI\u2019ve only recently come to understand the big picture.  I\u2019ve been politically left my entire 46 years of life.  I understand some of the feminists indoctrination but haven\u2019t given feminism much thought since dorm room conversations in college.  \n\nI don\u2019t assume all will understand my concern for college age women and men. I can\u2019t excuse the false accusations but I do understand the confusion these young women feel.  \n\nThe \u201cliberation\u201d in feminism is sexual liberation.  These young women are being indoctrinated to believe that career, independence, empowerment, requires that they reject traditional relationships and that \u201cempowerment\u201d is somehow related to \u201csexual freedom.\u201d\n\nThis is complete nonsense and always has been nonsense.  However, it does explain why this hookup and rape culture exists.  \n\nYoung women are finding themselves in sexual situations that they don\u2019t enjoy and don\u2019t completely understand.  I can\u2019t excuse not holding a person accountable for making bad decisions.  I do understand that feminism is indoctrination and indoctrination is powerful.\n\nMy sympathy is for the young man who was incarcerated for 4 years.  I\u2019m deeply saddened that this entire situation exists.  Politically motivated feminism has created this rape culture intentionally to further the interest of the ideology.\n\nLike a religious cult, feminism traps young women with promises of equality and empowerment. It teachers that a non existent patriarchy the an evil entity oppressing women.  It\u2019s only interest is political power and requires indoctrinating new members to gain more power.  It\u2019s authority comes from the respect we give to academic institutions.  \n\nFeminism does not empower women, rather it holds them back from achieving their full potential.  The women who reach the highest level of business are not feminists, some may pay lip service to feminism, but none have used the ideas of feminism to achieve high levels of success.\n\nFeminists write for magazines, newspapers, popular culture, Hollywood, etc.  Feminism is a secular religious cult, and religious cults understand how to keep the members from asking critical questions.\n\nI\u2019m embarrassed and ashamed such extremism has come from the left side of the political spectrum.  I once thought extremism belonged exclusively to the right wing.  However, there\u2019s plenty of extreme views on the left. \n\nI can no passively ignore and continue to support either the left or the right.  I have no idea how to resolve this mess.","created_utc":1582666583000,"comment_id":"fiq80am","parent_id":"t3_f995yc","score":233,"submission_id":"f995yc"}

{"author":"ccg08","body":"The term is a great example of feminism's terrible PR in appealing to men. If they called it 'the way in which men are socialized by society that is damaging to themselves and others', I'm sure many in this sub would actually agree.\n\nBelow are a few ways that masculinity is 'toxically' socialized. \n\n-Men are socialized against expressing emotions other than anger, enthusiasm and determination. This leads to many emotionally crippled men who struggle to cope with emotional distress.\n\n-Men are socialized to suffer alone. In situations of emotional distress, it is generally more acceptable for men to 'man up' and shut down their feelings rather than seek emotional support.\n\n-Men are socialized to be self-sacrificing expendable protectors. Many men will often take on more stress than they can handle just to take care of their families as best they can, only to struggle without the skills and social support society has enabled for women.\n\n-Men are socialized against pursuing more feminine careers (see previous points). \n\nAll in all, these are issues many of us can get behind. Why do so many in this sub turn their noses up? Because the term sounds like it means that being a man is harmful to society, in and of itself. As I said, feminism has terrible PR in appealing to men.","created_utc":1537936261000,"comment_id":"e6mraen","parent_id":"t3_9itxjd","score":102,"submission_id":"9itxjd"}

This is in part explained the [US'](https:\/\/slate.com\/human-interest\/2018\/02\/the-u-s-is-decades-behind-the-world-on-paid-leave-this-gives-us-an-advantage.html) poor [parental leave policy](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2018\/02\/05\/the-worlds-richest-countries-guarantee-mothers-more-than-a-year-of-paid-maternity-leave-the-u-s-guarantees-them-nothing\/?utm_term=.4b6823d7c24a), specifically the fact that there is no federally mandated paid parental leave (even *Mexico* has [six weeks](https:\/\/www.littler.com\/publication-press\/publication\/mexico-new-maternity-leave-regulations)). This policies **can** hurt women disproportionally because they have to recover from pregnancy (again I wouldn't call this sexist but I also wouldn't call it a 'lifestyle' decision).\n\nFrom the article,\n\n>The difficulty that these professionals may face in balancing caregiving responsibilities with full-time STEM employment suggests that this issue is a concern for the STEM workforce broadly and not just for the retention of women.  \n>  \n>**\u201cThus, scholarly and policy literature framing child-rearing responsibilities as solely a women\u2019s problem is short-sighted.\u201d**\n\nBUT this is not a just women\/feminist issue.

Additionally, most cultures promote women looking after children from an early age. We're blaming men for wanting to work when really it's society as a whole that needs an attitude adjustment. And lastly, people expect this issue to be resolved in years when the reality is it will take decades. Similarly for men to transition to other women dominated industries.

{"author":"thedragonturtle","body":"Everyone misses the nuance on the women's football teams equal pay argument, and fair enough too because few papers actually headline their articles properly. Here's the actual difference:\n\n* The women's team are on guaranteed pay, the men are pay-for-play. Perfectly acceptable to pay more for temporary workers\n* The women's team get health insurance\n* The women's team get half-pay maternity leave\n* FIFA award less prize money to women because in the rest of the world women's soccer brings less revenue\n* The women's team earn more revenue than the mens team from tickets but not from prize money\n\nAlso, I think the percentage portion of the revenue the women earn is higher than what the men get.\n\nAnyway - the reason for the legal battle - it's not as straightforward as 'equal pay' - they're asking for the above provisions to be removed so that their pay can be increased.\n\ni.e. they're asking for 'equal terms & conditions resulting in higher pay'. They're asking for health insurance, maternity-pay etc to all be removed, and guaranteed pay to be removed. They want pay-per-play as this will earn them more money.","created_utc":1562864267000,"comment_id":"eti1q4b","parent_id":"t3_cbqii4","score":44,"submission_id":"cbqii4"}

{"author":"grandmasbroach","body":"If you don't have the money to fight it, you're fucked. In my divorce, my more or less gish galloped me with exhibits of BS \"evidence.\" One of which was a bruise on her leg she took a picture of and said I did. She got the bruise when we were moving to a new place and we were getting the couch through the front door and it slipped on her end, causing a big bruise. She took a picture saying, I want to save this so I cna show people how bad ass I am. Oh how naive I was...\n\nSo, she throws out something like 90 exhibits like this and of all manner of other things to make me look bad. None of it was actual proof of me being abusive, because I wasn't abusive, and so there's no actual evidence of said abuse. But, because I was the petitioner, it was on me to show I didn't do all of this. Without a lawyer, because she drained $30k out of our joint savings, I got massively and intensely ass fucked with no remorse. Even though I had actual proof she was the one who was abusive and had mental health issues, the story she and her women's advocacy group (that's what they call them so the trial can go on \"unrepresented. They're lawyers in everything but name.) painted me in such a bad light that the judge did everything he could possibly do to make the outcome of this divorce awful for me. \n\nHere's the real kicker, my ex had been arrested twice for DV in the past because the neighbors called the cops when she lost it on those occasions. She had post partum depression and mania, that bordered on going schizophrenic because of the state of paranoia she would work herself into. This is all documented btw. She also had to do two psyche exams when she was arrested for DV, both times she was said to have been \"blatantly dishonest in the diagnostic testing to see herself in a more positive light than is true.\" Basically, the tests ask the same question ten different ways, and she'd answer them differently ten different ways. I have never been so much as charged with a violent crime, much less convicted of one. The most trouble I've ever been in was for traffic fines, and I went to jail once as a teen because I was at a party and had a beer in my hand when the police came. \n\nSo, the judge in my divorce decided, all because of a few tears and made up delusions of a mentally unstable person with drug and alcohol problems, with multiple violent crime arrests, no stable income, no further education, would get full custody. Four years later, I still only am allowed to see my daughter for 7 hours on Sundays, 11-6, and not a minute more. She cries when it's time to leave and go back to her mom's. She says her mom spanks her when she's mad. Which, is all the time. She's already had a kid with some guy who lives in a shed he calls a tiny house in the woods, illegally. Dude is a tattoo apprentice. He's so broke he can't afford his own car. Guess who lost their car in the divorce and is driving it now? Yup, her new boyfriend! He drives my old car to drop my kid off to me on Sundays because it's one of the only days she works. \n\nI told the court I didn't want to proceed without a lawyer because the case was so complicated and we needed to figure out the best interests of our daughter. I was told no, we would both be unrepresented. She was anything but unrepresented. The women's group that took potty on her has a literal team of lawyers to work on cases like this Apparently, the best interests of a child now is to live with a loser drug addict who can't even spell the word goal, much less attain anything or live a life that a child can take as a positive example. After all, I'm there with massive child support payments to pick up the tab for both of them! They don't need to act like adults, that's what I'm here for... \n\nGuy's, don't get married. If you do, and get divorced, get a lawyer. I stumbled up this, and trp sub about six months too late. My divorce rape is what got me trying to figure out wtf was going on because I couldn't make sense of the rulings the court kept making. I started to dig, and ended up here. I know a lot of guys here are against trp. Personally, I'm not. I'm oldejough to know what I can and should apply to my life and situation, and which ones I can pass on. I definitely think a lot of guys who've lacked a positive masculine influence stand to gain a lot by internalizing some red pill concepts. That's just like, my opinion, man. \n\nFor real though, don't get married. The family courts are stacked against men beyond belief.

{"author":"The_Great_Sarcasmo","body":"An insightful extract from this book :\n\nKathy Clique was a new hire. A recent gradu\u00adate  with a  master's degree in  marketing, she was happy to finally leave the academic world and  hit the ground running at her  first  \"real\" job. Socially outgoing and chatty, Kathy related to her colleagues as though they were personal friends. She started a company bowling team, went to happy hour with coworkers, and  was devilishly excited to  engage in  office gossip. \n\nUpper management liked her energy, initia\u00adtive, and \"people-person\" personality. It wasn't long before she developed a  close-knit group of followers at work. \n\nEric Introvert, however, tended to keep to himself. True to  the many  stereotypes about engineers, he  was more comfortable  working with data and things than with people. A long\u00adtime employee of the company, he had worked his  way up over the  years  from an  entry-level position to senior engineer. \n\nIt  didn't take Kathy long to  discover  that she disliked Eric. He was reserved, had few friends, and did not participate in  company social activities. Likewise, he consistently declined Kathy's invitations to join the bowl\u00ading team and other such things. Worse, when she  expressed new ideas about how to  market the company's products, he often criticized her for \"overselling\" the products' technical capa\u00adbilities. \n\nIn  sum, Eric got in  her way and made her look bad. So, true to  her nature, Kathy began to communicate her dismay to  her  large circle of  friends at  work. She complained that  Eric stifled her ideas by interrupting and criticizing her during meetings. \n\nShe said Eric discounted her perspectives because she was female. To be supportive, her work friends echoed her sen\u00adtiments and reinforced her negative views of Eric. Empowered, Kathy  then  took  her  com\u00adplaints  to  human resources. She  stated  that Eric  did not  acknowledge her  contributions because she  was  a  woman. She  said  that he spoke \"aggressively\" and that she did not \"feel safe\"  during  meetings with him. \n\n\"When HR asked if there was anything else about Eric that made her feel uncomfortable, Kathy added that perhaps he didn't listen to  her ideas because he was sexually attracted to her. And now that she thought more deeply about it, she recalled instances when he stared at her breasts rather than making eye contact while she was speak\u00ading. Further, when asked if there were any wit\u00adnesses,  Kathy said  she  had  been sharing her concerns with coworkers for quite some time, they agreed with her, and they would vouch for her. \n\nHR confronted Eric.  Blindsided, he  said that he had no idea what Kathy or her friends at work were talking about and that he related \n to her no differently than any other employee. He also said he had not violated any company policies, no  one  else  had  ever  complained about him during his years with the company, and HR had no tangible evidence to support allegations of sex discrimination. \n\nNevertheless, in  order  to  maintain a safe work  environment, promote diversity, and avoid  further complications, HR  mandated that  Eric  formally apologize to  Kathy and refrain from criticizing her. They also threat\u00adened to terminate Eric if he did not comply, informed his manager of what  had occurred, and added documentation about the incident to Eric's permanent personnel file. \n\nRumors traveled fast around the company about Eric's apology and about his disrespect for  women. Fearing termination, he  no  lon\u00adger voiced his opinions during meetings and retracted his views whenever female cowork\u00aders  took issue  with  them.  He was  eventually passed over for promotion. Kathy was applauded for having the brav\u00adery to voice her concerns and stand up to sex\u00adual  discrimination. She  advanced quickly in her career with the company.","created_utc":1575422667000,"comment_id":"f9k6hdy","parent_id":"t3_e5ikbp","score":451,"submission_id":"e5ikbp"}

{"author":"BloodyTamponExtracto","body":"The problem is that frequently it isn't about believing or not believing, it's about understanding what happened and whether or not that was actually rape.\n\nFeminists basically want a woman to say \"I was raped\" and have that woman get nothing but support.  But does anyone even know what that phrase means anymore?  It might mean that a guy jumped out of the bushes and forced sex on her.  It might me she got drunk and consented to sex and then regretted that decision.  It might mean a guy accidentally brushed up against her on a crowded bus.\n\nBut we're not even supposed to ask for details.  She said she was raped, so she was raped!\n\nBut that doesn't help anyone.  If she consented to sex after a few drinks, that's not rape and she needs to understand that.  It isn't about not believing her, it's about correcting her misunderstanding of rape and consent.\n\nBecause if women think that consensual sex is rape, it leads to bad outcomes for everyone.  The guy is faced with a false rape accusation for having consensual sex.  The police are faced with investigating consensual sex.  And the \"victim\" will continue to be repeatedly \"victimized\" because she doesn't realize that she's consenting to sex and not getting raped.","created_utc":1627508749000,"comment_id":"h6tvimk","parent_id":"t3_ot6md9","score":54,"submission_id":"ot6md9"}

At least, that's what Prof. Sonja Starr's research on federal criminal cases suggests. Prof. Starr's recent paper, \"Estimating Gender Disparities in Federal Criminal Cases,\" looks closely at a large dataset of federal cases, and reveals some significant findings. After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, **\"men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do,\" and \"\\[w\\]omen are\u2026twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.\" This gender gap is about six times as large as the racial disparity** that Prof. Starr found in another recent paper.\n\n[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2968709\/](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2968709\/)\n\n>When physical aggression is the subject of inquiry, studies consistently find that as many women self-report perpetrating this behavior as do men; some studies find a higher prevalence of physical aggression committed by women. For example, the National Family Violence Survey, a nationally representative study of 6,002 men and women, found that in the year before the survey, **12.4% of wives self-reported that they used violence against their husbands compared to 11.6% of husbands** who self-reported using violence against their wives. Furthermore, **4.8% of wives reported using severe violence against their husbands, whereas 3.4% of husbands reported using severe violence.** Studies with college samples also find that men and women commit similar rates of physical aggression or that **a higher prevalence of women commit physical aggression.**\n\n[https:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/vio.2017.0016](https:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/vio.2017.0016)\n\n>Although criminologists have not ignored women as offenders, female criminality has often been given secondary attention or considered to be of a special nature. More than a century ago, for example, Cesare Lombroso, widely regarded as the \u201cfather of criminology,\u201d characterized the female offender as possessing a latent \u201cfund of immorality,\u201d reflected in crimes such as prostitution and lasciviousness (Lombroso and Ferrero 1898, p. 216).  \n>  \n>Wolfgang (1958), in his classic study of homicide patterns in Philadelphia, emphasized the need to disaggregate homicide data by gender, demonstrating that women are involved as the perpetrator of victim-precipitated homicides twice as often as in other murderous situations. In addition, he reported that women and men were equally represented as offenders and victims in intimate partner homicides. With few exceptions, however, the majority of early homicide research failed to examine the role of gender, thus obscuring the differences in offending and victimization between men and women (Dobash and Dobash 2017).\n\n[https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/11573\/gender-of-inmates-in-us-federal-prisons-and-general-population\/](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/11573\/gender-of-inmates-in-us-federal-prisons-and-general-population\/)\n\n>There's a pretty hefty gender gap in U.S. federal prisons, and prisons and jails in general. According to the most recent numbers published by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), **93.2 percent of the approximately 185,500 federal inmates are men, and only 6.8 percent are women.** This gap becomes all the more astonishing when you compare the stats to the makeup of the general population.  \n>  \n>There are studies that indicate that **men aren't necessarily more criminal by design but there indeed is an institutional bias against them**. For example, **men are regularly given much longer sentences and \"female arrestees are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions entirely, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.\"**\n\nThere's an enormous gender bias in the courts, yet in our current climate of gender equality, none of the big names in gender activism are giving this any attention. Quite the opposite, feminists are trying to shutdown women's prisons altogether:\n\n[https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/public-leaders-network\/2018\/mar\/13\/penal-system-men-women-new-strategy-inquiry](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/public-leaders-network\/2018\/mar\/13\/penal-system-men-women-new-strategy-inquiry)\n\n[https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/politics\/2018\/06\/26\/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent\/](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/politics\/2018\/06\/26\/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent\/)","created_utc":1563261781000,"comment_id":"etve3ef","parent_id":"t3_cdibpc","score":11,"submission_id":"cdibpc"}

If my friend failed to complete his work for any reason he would be chastised for being lazy, have privileges taken away and lose points for late work.

{"author":"mhandanna","body":"**Comment from CawnporeStation:**\n\nA  couple of these articles are just summaries. But most report or point  to a specific piece of research. A very rough summary of the findings of  this research is:\n\n>\"Teachers  in developed countries routinely mark boys down compared to girls for  the same standard of work. Studies show boys know this is happening and  adjust their effort and investment in education because of it. A common  explanation of why teachers do this, is that they are subconsciously  marking boys down because boys' behaviour is more challenging than  girls'. Even if that is the reason, then it's very unfair and  unprofessional: schools should deal with academic marking and behaviour  separately. But it's even more unfair, when you take into account that  research shows that teachers punish boys more harshly than girls for the  same standard of misbehaviour. They are also more likely to label boys  as \"troublemakers\" or \"class clowns\", something that impacts not only  how the boy perceives himself but also how other pupils perceive the  boy. Teachers do not treat girls in the same way. So boys are in a  double bind. They're are unfairly marked down because of their  behaviour, behaviour that is judged according to a less forgiving  standard than that used with girls. The Norwegian research found that  the people most likely to protect girls against the consequences of low  performance, and presumably also poor behaviour, were women who felt  strongly that gender quotas should be used to help girls and women.

But what it finds is  highly significant for the debate around boys in education. It finds  that any academic study which finds evidence of bias in higher education  against women is widely reported in the general press and cited by  other researchers. But any study which finds bias against men in higher  education, sinks like a stone and is neither reported not cited to  anywhere near the same extent. So, there is a bias against reporting on  or considering possible bias against men in academia.\n\nIf  the same bias exists in relation to schools, then we'd expect your  teachers either not to have heard of any or many of the studies above.  We'd also expect them not to have been involved in sex-specific efforts,  based on these studies, to address boys' underperformance at schools.  So, if they have not heard of all this and are not doing something about  it, they prove your thesis that boys are being underserved in  education. Or at least, they make it more plausible and more worthy of  education.\n\nSceptics may say that  these studies are not from the UK, or not all from the UK. This is true.  But the LSE and OECD ones do include research on UK schools. And in any  case, boys are underachieving in all Western nations. Looking at these  results from other countries with similar problems, we should want to  carry out research to see if the same things are happening here. That we  are not doing this, is more evidence of bias. If there was this weight  of evidence that girls were being discriminated against, do you think  the supposed campaigners for \"gender equality\" in politics and public  life would ignore it?","created_utc":1607839385000,"comment_id":"gfle1s4","parent_id":"t3_kbxzlo","score":47,"submission_id":"kbxzlo"}

{"author":"Settlers6","body":"Is the sub being brigaded or something? \n\nTo clarify for those that share the sentiment of \"but doesn't r\/mensrights judge feminists by their worst examples?\": we don't. At the very least, I don't. I judge the actions in the name of the feminist movement (e.g. fighting against shared parenting, promoting the wage gap myth). \n\nAnd those are usually done by what most might call \"extreme feminists\". The average feminist, who I don't think is evil, implicitly condones these actions by being part of a movement that creates inequality as net result, without calling these actions out en masse. Usually because they believe in myths like the wage gap, so they believe that what the movement is doing is fighting for equality.\n\nSo they might have great intentions, but their actions are not. The quote holds true, in my opinion. I don't think this classifies as an unfair generalization of feminism (which is an optional ideological movement, as opposed to being a man, which is an involuntary result of biology).","created_utc":1509375474000,"comment_id":"dp328jy","parent_id":"t3_79jl4q","score":11,"submission_id":"79jl4q"}

We're not teaching them that violence is wrong, only that violence against women is wrong, that women should be idolized while men are left to accept their positions as worthless (and inherently violent) people that should expend their energy resisting and bottling up what makes them who they are, and relieve their rage by being violent against other men.\n\nWe are telling them to conform to an antiquated and preposterous set of rules and requirements that prohibit them from expressing emotions or being themselves, or following their dreams, and who knows what else.

{"author":"w1g2","body":"There's a strange dichotomy happening from our evolutionary roles. On the one hand, we feel endless sympathy for women having the reproductive role (pregnancy, childbirth, nursing) to the point of celebrating when they disavow it completely. But men *voluntarily* taking on the disposable role gets less sympathy and less recognition as being praiseworthy in the first place. I understand that it was precisely because the reproductive role wasn't voluntarily taken on by women that it deserved more sympathy, but that also meant the voluntarily sympathetic reactions of men to help and protect women deserved even more praise. \n\nBut I suppose what it really comes down to is when we see women safe and happy, we feel that is appropriate. Whether she is currently pregnant or has children doesn't matter as much, because what's most important is that she is in a safe environment to potentially have children. In that way, she fulfills her biological role.\n\nWhen men are working hard, suffering, or even dying, it doesn't rattle our instincts too much because we feel that is appropriate, they are meant to be the ones who die.

{"author":"Rockztar","body":"As I read through the [document](https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/368688363\/James-Damore-vs-Google-Class-Action-Lawsuit) and after especially in recent years having heard more and more of these stories, there's one thing I can't get to add up: What does Google get out of this?\n\nIt seems to me that anything a company does can be considered to selfpreserving - even things that face value appear to altruistic, usually boost a company's reputation more than anything else.\n\nI can't understand why Google would do these things that Damore seems to be able to prove. Has Google just become so big that they can afford to take a \"moral stand\" against caucasian males, the demography which seems to have made this company what it is? By now it also strikes me as ironic that Google would attempt to take a moral stance in these matters, before they stop evading taxes.\n\nI'm very confused, because an advantage of capitalism is that you can usually see the financial gain a company might have from decisions they make. What has happened, when you can fire a guy with the following qualifications\n\n>  Damore received his Bachelor of Science degree in Molecular Biology, Physics, and Chemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He then earned his Master of Science in Systems Biology from Harvard University. 21.\n \n> Damore first began working for Google as a Harvard student in or around the summer of 2013 as a Ph.D. software intern. By around December 2013, Google converted this internship into a full-time position, and hired Damore as a Software Engineer.\n\n> Damore was diligent and loyal, and received substantial praise for the quality of his work. Damore received the highest possible rating twice, including in his most recent performance review, and consistently received high performance ratings, placing him in the top few percentile of Google employees. Throughout the course of his employment with Google, Damore received approximately eight performance bonuses, the most recent of which was approximately 20% of his annual salary. Damore also received stock bonuses from the Google amounting to approximately $150,000 per year. 24.\n \n> Damore was never disciplined or suspended during his entire tenure at Google. 25.\n \n> Based on Damore\u2019s excellent work, Damore was promoted to Senior Software Engineer in or around January 2017\u2014just eight months before his unlawful termination by Google\n\nfor making what I perceive to be a rational attempt at encouraging discussion - a level of engagement that I bet millions of employers around the world would love to see from their employees. The only thing I recall as being phrased in an unfortunate manner, are his comments on women's neurotic\/anxious nature, and I believe that part of the memo is also what Google bases most of their case on, when they say he's perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes.","created_utc":1515550795000,"comment_id":"dsfe3nw","parent_id":"t3_7p6uki","score":26,"submission_id":"7p6uki"}

{"author":"ruffykunn","body":"The author of this is herself a feminist who's had enough of this bullshit:\n\n>What is brave about manipulating a narrative surrounding a man\u2019s  death? What is courageous about having McGowan speak on Argento\u2019s  behalf, while Ottavia Bourdain has to tell her 11-year-old daughter that  her father is never coming home? I can\u2019t even find a word to describe  what that is. It is stomach-turning. To hide behind the story of being a  rape survivor and to shelter one\u2019s self with the #MeToo movement is  disgusting.  \n>  \n>As the mother of an 11-year-old girl, I\u2019ve tried to  imagine being in Ottavia\u2019s shoes. I imagine having to tell my daughter  how her father died. Then I imagine that the most grief that Ottavia is  feeling is not that Bourdain is dead and gone, but that she can\u2019t fix  it. She can\u2019t take that pain away from her child. Thinking about it  makes me feel so sad. Yet, Ottavia remains stoically silent. She has to  protect her family. It blows my mind that McGowan and Argento never  thought about Bourdain\u2019s daughter before kick-starting their media  circus with that open letter.  \n>  \n>Why is the American media protecting Argento and McGowan\u2019s victim  narrative? Why are they feeding it like the ugly, insatiable beast that  it is? Have we forgotten that the #MeToo movement was started in 2006 by  44-year-old Tarana Burke to inspire healing for sexual assault  survivors in her black community in the Bronx? I interviewed Burke on my  podcast, [Improper Etiquette](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/improper-etiquette\/episode-61-metoo-feat-tarana-burke),  and her selfless story is so far removed from the celebrities like  Argento and McGowan who have co-opted it. That said, would #MeToo have  the power it does now without Hollywood\u2019s endorsement? Probably not. But  that\u2019s a matter separate from the behavior of Argento and McGowan in  the aftermath of Bourdain\u2019s passing.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n>In mid-June, a mysterious Instagram account called @justicefortony emerged, then shut down some days later (there were people on social media pushing for the account to be stopped.) However, when it was initially live, the first post was a black box with the following cryptic comment:  \n>  \n>\u201cNot surprised she blocked me. Having the truth out there was becoming too uncomfortable. She was a monster to him. She took an already very damaged and very sensitive man and destroyed him. His friends and coworkers tried their best to make him see what was going on, but he would just push everyone away. No one could say anything negative about Asia or Tony would try to remove them from his life.\u201d  \n>  \n>The post went on to describe how Bourdain had one of his longtime crew members fired at Argento\u2019s request, and how much Bourdain had changed after dating the actress.  \n>  \n>\u201cIn the end those pictures were too much,\u201d wrote the creator of @justicefortony, referring to the paparazzi photos of Argento and Cl\u00e9ment. \u201cHe must have finally realized what she was doing and his world came crushing down.\u201d  \n>  \n>So what led to Bourdain\u2019s death? Do we just say it was depression? I think suicide is a lot more complicated than that. It goes against everything our brain and body tell us to do. Most of us wake up every morning and try our best to stay alive. Basically, we do shit to avoid dying. But perhaps a person can hit their pain threshold, and everyone\u2019s is different.  \n>  \n>Men don\u2019t deal with humiliation the same way women do. Men sometimes murder their lovers over humiliation. They also kill themselves over feeling humiliated. That doesn\u2019t mean that we women should be held responsible for men\u2019s behavior. Fuck no. But we should recognize how powerful we can be. We can choose to use our power any way we want. Maybe we should acknowledge that power, so we can proceed accordingly?  \n>  \n>In the comment section of @justicefortony, its creator went on to detail the fighting that took place between Bourdain and Argento before his death.  \n>  \n>\u201cThey started fighting on Tuesday,\u201d the person wrote. \u201cTony had to leave the set multiple times to talk to her on the phone. Things escalated on Wednesday when by all accounts she told him she no longer wanted to be with him. Everyone was keeping an eye on him all day and night because he was incredibly distraught.\u201d  \n>  \n>@justicefortony went on to state that this was not the first time the couple had broken up, and that by Thursday, Bourdain seemed to be better and \u201ckind of wanted everyone to back off.\u201d  \n>  \n>Days later, @justicefortony continued, \u201cKnowing this, her posts about Tony being her love and her rock were particularly distasteful. If she just disappeared and stopped harassing everyone, if she didn\u2019t have Rose write that awful letter, if she didn\u2019t try to gain from his death, I wouldn\u2019t be here writing this.\u201d  \n>  \n>I would be skeptical of this random, anonymous reveal if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Ottavia Bourdain was following @justicefortony.\n\nLastly:\n\n>Two women who dreamt of being famous movie stars have now selfishly and irresponsibly used the #MeToo movement to suck whatever amount of attention and fame they can from it. They have used this movement to help only themselves.  \n>  \n>I don\u2019t think either of these women have a grasp of or are capable of understanding Tarana Burke\u2019s movement. And as much as I hate the term \u201cwhite feminism\u201d (that\u2019s the white feminist in me feeling defensive), these women are the epitome of what that is.  \n>  \n>You can\u2019t hide shitty, awful behavior behind the excuse of misogyny. Not everything has to do with gender discrimination and the patriarchy, and to pretend that it does is a disservice to the feminist movement. I am all about fighting toxic masculinity, but to demand that all women must agree and support one another because we are the same gender is ridiculous and illogical. (Toxic femininity exists. We can\u2019t continue to deny that.) Maybe McGowan and Argento are just two really damaged human beings? I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that you cannot heal unless you own up to your shit and get real honest with yourself about who you are. These two women seem to be completely incapable of being honest with themselves.  \n>  \n>In this new climate of public reckoning, #MeToo, and the Trump regime, we are all walking on eggshells, terrified to criticize anyone at the risk of being branded a sexist, a racist, or a homophobe. The kind of outrage that disagreement causes in 2018 makes it nearly impossible to seek truth through an exchange of ideas. I am saddened that this discourages people from speaking up. But I refuse to live in fear. I refuse to live my life worrying about who I will offend by speaking my mind. And I encourage you to do the same.","created_utc":1530895442000,"comment_id":"e1vqk48","parent_id":"t3_8wihr7","score":498,"submission_id":"8wihr7"}

{"author":"TigPlaze","body":"More proof that it makes sense for a man to be very selective about whom he has sex with.  We're taught to jump at almost any chance to get sex, but that's a bad policy.  Sex is inherently risky.  There are STDs.  You could get stuck obligated to support a kid for 18 years that you didn't want.  Or some shitty person like the woman in that article could violate your privacy and mock you.  That was a sexual encounter that was not worth it for him!  \n\nNot every sexual encounter is worth it.  There are some that you're better off saying \"no\" to.  Declining an opportunity to have sex does not make you less of a man.  It does not make you some kind of incel.  \n\nThe best advice I ever got about sex was this: Only have sex with someone whom you know you can trust.  I live by that.  I don't care about so-called \"body counts.\"  I'm not out to get some huge number.  I can think of plenty of women I wish I had said \"no\" to before I realized the best policy is a very selective policy.  When I was younger and the hormones raged, I wanted to just get any sex I could get with any girl who was willing and looked good.  But the truth is, you're way better off limiting your sexual encounters to people you know you can trust.  I'd bet that guy in the article wishes he hadn't trusted her.","created_utc":1617343303000,"comment_id":"gt2vtdf","parent_id":"t3_mi5ni6","score":56,"submission_id":"mi5ni6"}

Must have been one of those self-driving cars malfunctioning, I guess. Otherwise I'm sure they would have written \"Man murdered by female domestic abuser\", the same as they do when a man kills a woman.\n\nThe massive double standard around media treatment of domestic violence makes me sick.\n\nLast year a 20-something female standup comedian, Eurydice Dixon, while walking home in the early hours of the morning was killed by an Autistic man with some serious mental health issues. As a result we had months of demonisation of men in the media, candlelight vigils to protest violence against women, calls for curfews on men, demands that all men \"do better\" in order to somehow prevent 3am attacks in parks by mentally ill men I guess. OK, I promise to remind all the mentally ill guys I know that they shouldn't murder women, but that isn't going to help.\n\nThere will be absolutely nothing like that after this poor guy's death, I guarantee.\n\nRight now the media is still obsessed with the murder of Hannah Clarke last month. We've had hundreds of media stories about it already and they're still coming so quickly that we've going to see many hundreds more.\n\nClarke was burned to death in her with her two kids. It was a horriffic crime and completely understandable that it shocked people and raised so much concern.\n\nBut in the month before Hannah Clarke died, there two separate incidents where women poured petrol (gasoline) on their male partners and burned them to death. Two cases in a month! How did the media report on those murders? Extremely low-key and unemotional, e.g. \"Woman charged over death of man\". No fuss, no protests, no demonisation of women or even demands that women \"be better\". Nothing. Just the basic reporting of the facts and it sank without a trace, not another word mentioned in the media.","created_utc":1583058679000,"comment_id":"fj5d75q","parent_id":"t3_fbnafp","score":716,"submission_id":"fbnafp"}

I was too drunk to drive so I called the police.  They came and took my statement.  Took her statement, where fortunately she admitted the truth.  Then they made her admit it to her boyfriend.  Then they called them a cab and sent them on their way after determining that there was no probability of domestic violence, because they both were embarresed and felt guilty as fuck.

{"author":"zazzlekdazzle","body":"This is a very interesting and important topic.  Does anyone have access to reputable research that reveals the level of false-rape accusations versus the opposite, women who are raped but never come forward or who came forward but were not believed?\n\nIt's amazing how much one's views on this issue are informed just by their personal experience, and it is very hard to take a global view.  If you have had one experience yourself, or even one friend who has had an experience, with one or the other of these tragic situations, it can convince you that it is rampant.  \n\nI don't even think it has to be one or the other necessarily, but the two situations do set up a dichotomy: society is a place where a woman can accuse a man of rape just because she feels like it and he is prosecuted to the full extent of the law with no supporting proof other than her word OR society is a place where rape is very hard to prove and shaming to the woman unless she is a white woman attacked by a brown stranger with a weapon.  I.e. rape-situations (real or otherwise) usually happen without witnesses so it a woman's word against a man's, does society default to the woman's word or the man's?  I think you only need to have one bad personal experience, even second-hand, to become sure of one side versus another, when in fact there are a lot of grey areas that need to be discussed.\n\nThank you again for bringing to light this important issue, I hope it opens a critical dialogue so false accusations can stop and true victims will feel more comfortable coming forward so the true rapists are the ones that are punished.","created_utc":1377464862000,"comment_id":"cbuydxn","parent_id":"t3_1l1lpf","score":5,"submission_id":"1l1lpf"}

{"author":"Gambizzle","body":"Yep my ex went to Japan on a holiday (to cool down, look after her mental health and be with family after getting a conviction for trying to kill me... I quite generously allowed her to take our daughter because my ex-wife struggled with mental health issues and even after she got convicted, I was still concerned about her welfare + didn\u2019t wanna use her mental instability as a reason to block access to family\/culture).  \n  \nShe never came home. Instead, she went into hiding, married some random Japanese guy within 3 months (who moved across the country), put her new husband as the \u2018adoptive father\u2019 of our child and blocked all access. They then told her I didn\u2019t exist and pilled her up with ADHD meds because she was \u2018angry\u2019 and \u2018delusional\u2019 following these circumstances.  \n  \n$30,000 in legal fees (and 5 years of mediation\/hearings) later the Japanese courts have established that yes... our child was abducted and yes... the \u2018parents\u2019 lied to her. However, she has been living with them in Japan for 5 years, so me getting custody would be a disruption to the status quo. Also, I could have no access to her medical records or say in whether she should continue to be pilled up with strong ADHD meds that make her goggle-eyed.  \n  \nInstead, I get 3 days of access a year. During this access, my ex-wife\u2019s husband is present (intentionally making it all tense\/awkward + policing what she says to me), all presents are thrown in the bin and there\u2019s not a lot I can do about it.  \n  \nThis is more a childrens rights issue than a mens\/womens rights issue.

{"author":"bertdavis69","body":"Hey gang - I just wanted to post this here because it's slightly relevant to something that's going on in my life right now. I'm not really looking for sympathy or emotional support, just more pragmatic advice.\n\nMy wife has problems. She abuses prescription amphetamines, and will sometimes go ballistic and abuse me. I also found out about an affair, supposedly \"emotional only\" that she was having for at least 3 of the first 6 months of our marriage. I found out about it in July. It was going on may-July. We married in March. We have a 2 year old son.\n\nI had my foot out of the door after I found out about the affair. The abuse was a thing, but had not really happened for a year or so before we married. I found out about the affair, and of course she does everything in her power to be the best wife possible. Until Sunday morning. Our son was at her mom's house. We were going to go to church, I tried to wake her up once, failed, tried again like 15 minutes later, failed again, and just said \"Ok, I'm going to church by myself then\". Got in the shower, and she starts walking by asking me \"Why are you mad\" over and over, with me calmy saying \"I'm not mad, I promise\". After about 6 times, I get sick of it, make some shit up, and just say it, not really thinking about what will happen next. \"You don't have sex with me enough\". \n\nOk, so at this point, she jumps in the shower, grabs my junk - fucking hard, starts beating up on me, etc. - I just get her out of the shower a few times so that I can start to actually get away. Not like I'm going to go streaking down my neighborhood street covered in soap at 9am on a sunday morning. \n\nAnyway, as I'm getting out, She cocks her hand back and hits me across the face as hard as she can. I grab her and put her on our bedroom floor. She immediately starts calling me a monster and everything under the sun. Of course her mom gets involved, and to be honest, believes and understands me. \n\nI am afraid that this is going to happen again, but that it's going to end much worse for me. She knows her mom didn't buy her story this time. She has to know that I'm calculating my exit of the relationship. She has to know that I'm only there to protect my son at this point. \n\nMy obvious solution is to record this shit. However, if this thing happens the way that it did before (I broke up because of the abuse before; came back because she was pregnant - yes, he's mine, yes I had the test done), she's not just going to haul off and hit me in the walmart parking lot. It's going to be while I'm driving 80mph down an interstate, while I'm in the shower, while I'm in bed, etc. She **only** does this in situations where I can't get away. If I do anything to protect myself, she immediately becomes a huge victim. How the hell am I supposed to actually get tape of it? If i started holding my phone up, she'd just stop or try to get my phone, or pretend like something's going on. \n\nTo be honest - it feels like she's doing it on purpose in order to try to get me to react so that she can leave the relationship on the \"he's a psychotic abuser\" note, instead of the \"my husband left me because I cheated on him\" note. It did not take her very long to go from an out of control person to a very apologetic and loving person after this event happened. I sense that she knew it didn't work this time, and is now back to trying to get me \"normal\" so that she can try again.\n\nWhat do y'all suggest that I do? I'd just leave, but there's no chance in my state, at all, for me to get custody without some kind of huge, huge evidence of her unfitness. I'm scared that if I file now, she's going to make something up and I'm going to completely lose my son. What do y'all suggest I do?\n\nThanks in advance, and please try not to patronize me. I've heard it all about how I shouldn't be with her, etc. I really just need some practical advice.

{"author":"FreedomThinker20","body":"It's a combination of a lot of things:\n\n1. Like the post says, the alienation of young, white men in society who are constantly told they are evil and wrong simply for existing. From a very young age, boys are shamed their behavior and told they're problematic and need to be drugged to behave better and focus, however usually it's a combination of bad parenting and that the school system is designed for girls, not boys. Society thinks men and women are interchangeable, when they aren't. Men and women are different, both have their strengths and weaknesses, which compliment each other.\n\n2. Feminism has convinced many young women that they don't need a husband, and in fact having a family is \"oppressive\" and limits their potential. Feminism has also ruined family courts, where the vast majority of the time, the women not only win custody of the children, but also get so much of their ex-husband's income he basically has to live on scraps. And not to mention that any woman can accuse a man of harassing\/assaulting\/rape her and his live will be ruined. Sure if it's completely made up, he probably wont face jail time, but the court of public opinion will already have made up their mind.\n\n3. The continuous escalation by the media and social media in completely destroying any reasonable political dialogue. White men have the highest likeliness of any demographic to be conservative or libertarian, and let's be honest, we all know the media labels anyone who isn't completely on board with their agenda a white nationalist\/supremacist, Nazi, KKK member, etc. This escalation puts anyone who significantly disagrees or questions the narrative on the defensive all the time, which isn't healthy. And on the opposite end of it, it makes anyone buys into their hogwash think that there all these evil people all around them and they must be stopped. \n\n4. And last, but certainly not least, single motherhood. Boys need a father or father figure to show them how to control themselves. They don't understand their limits and need a guiding hand on how to handle themselves and understand the world around them. A mother cannot teach a boy how to become a man. A boy is reckless without self discipline, which must be taught by the father. This what makes a proper man, when he can take all that rage and energy he feels from the testerone, and can control it and focus it to achieve things that benefit not only himself, but those around him.","created_utc":1565380629000,"comment_id":"ewf5lnn","parent_id":"t3_cnyn7r","score":177,"submission_id":"cnyn7r"}

{"author":"UbiquitousWobbegong","body":"I don't actually think this is as clear cut as a lot of people think it is. I don't think it's just culture that leads men to kill themselves more often than women. I think it's biology as well.\n\nMen are more assertive than women. They take risks more often. In my experience, they are more prideful about being a success without being propped up by others, and I think this may be rooted in evolutionary biology, and not just how we raise men.\n\nIf we combine those factors, that means men are going to kill themselves more effectively and more readily than women (statistically) given our current societal situation. We have loads of depressed people, loads of lonely people, and social trends that reinforce isolation (MeToo, Feminism, etc). We also have a very crappy starting point for young people trying to enter the workforce, where wages and upward mobility have stagnated, and we immigrate a lot of educated people instead of incentivizing our young people to grow in to those positions. \n\nWhen women are more successful than men, and refuse to date people less successful than themselves, is it any surprise that men who can't start a family or a career kill themselves or bury themselves in videogames? \n\nSo we have sociocultural, socioeconomic, and biological variables all tuned to push men to use a bullet instead of downing a whole bottle of painkillers. Is it any surprise that men are dying more from suicide? And how do we change any of those factors without disadvantaging women?

His wife brought in copies of some court papers for him and l let me see them a she told me the story. \nFourteen years ago, the man has a night if drunken sex with a woman and does not see her again. Twelve years pass and she located him. She had gotten pregnant and decided not to find the man when she found out a she had since meet another man and fallen in love with him. The husband made a career in the air force and loved his new daughter a his own and eventually decided to formally afoot her. In order to do that the biological father and mother must appear before a family court judge and explicitly agree to terminate all rights and claims against each other for visitation, support, etc. They do this. Everybody goes their own way and is happy.\nA couple of years later DSS shows up at his door with a warrant to arrest the father for unpaid child support. \"Why that greedy, conniving bitch\" you say. No. DSS had never been in contact with the mother, the adoptive father, the child nor anyone else. The judge they dragged the man to (same state, different county) was not amused at what was basically a money grab by DSS and ordered the man released immediately.\nMuch like the property seizure rules in drug arrests part of the payments filtering through the family court system is often taken as fees to help finance the system itself. Call me cynical, but it seemed pretty obvious thus was just a case of DSS trying to drum up additional funding by trolling through old case files for some poor bastard they could extort cash from. Fortunately, in this case, it didn't work.

At least, that's what Prof. Sonja Starr's research on federal criminal cases suggests. Prof. Starr's recent paper, \"Estimating Gender Disparities in Federal Criminal Cases,\" looks closely at a large dataset of federal cases, and reveals some significant findings. **After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, \"men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do,\" and \"\\[w\\]omen are twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.\" This gender gap is about six times as large as the racial disparity** that Prof. Starr found in another recent paper.\n\n[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2968709\/](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2968709\/)\n\n>When physical aggression is the subject of inquiry, studies consistently find that as many women self-report perpetrating this behavior as do men; some studies find a higher prevalence of physical aggression committed by women. For example, the National Family Violence Survey, a nationally representative study of 6,002 men and women, found that in the year before the survey, **12.4% of wives self-reported that they used violence against their husbands compared to 11.6% of husbands** who self-reported using violence against their wives. Furthermore, **4.8% of wives reported using severe violence against their husbands, whereas 3.4% of husbands reported using severe violence.** Studies with college samples also find that men and women commit similar rates of physical aggression or that **a higher prevalence of women commit physical aggression.**\n\n[https:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/vio.2017.0016](https:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/vio.2017.0016)\n\n>**Although criminologists have not ignored women as offenders, female criminality has often been given secondary attention or considered to be of a special nature**. More than a century ago, for example, Cesare Lombroso, widely regarded as **the \u201cfather of criminology,\u201d characterized the female offender as possessing a latent \u201cfund of immorality,\u201d** reflected in crimes such as prostitution and lasciviousness (Lombroso and Ferrero 1898, p. 216).  \n>  \n>Wolfgang (1958), in his classic study of homicide patterns in Philadelphia, emphasized the need to disaggregate homicide data by gender, demonstrating that women are involved as the perpetrator of victim-precipitated homicides twice as often as in other murderous situations. In addition, he reported that **women and men were equally represented as offenders and victims in intimate partner homicides.** With few exceptions, however, the majority of early homicide research failed to examine the role of gender, thus obscuring the differences in offending and victimization between men and women (Dobash and Dobash 2017).\n\n[https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/11573\/gender-of-inmates-in-us-federal-prisons-and-general-population\/](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/11573\/gender-of-inmates-in-us-federal-prisons-and-general-population\/)\n\n>There's a pretty hefty gender gap in U.S. federal prisons, and prisons and jails in general. According to the most recent numbers published by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), **93.2 percent of the approximately 185,500 federal inmates are men, and only 6.8 percent are women.** This gap becomes all the more astonishing when you compare the stats to the makeup of the general population.  \n>  \n>There are studies that indicate that **men aren't necessarily more criminal by design but there indeed is an institutional bias against them.** For example, men are **regularly given much longer sentences and \"female arrestees are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions entirely, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.\"**\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nThere's an enormous gender bias in the courts, yet in our current climate of gender equality, none of the big names in gender activism are giving this any attention. Quite the opposite, feminists are trying to shutdown women's prisons altogether:\n\n[https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/public-leaders-network\/2018\/mar\/13\/penal-system-men-women-new-strategy-inquiry](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/public-leaders-network\/2018\/mar\/13\/penal-system-men-women-new-strategy-inquiry)\n\n>There are an estimated 4,000 women in prison today.  That\u2019s less than 5% of the total prison population but many more have  been affected at some point in their lives. Seven in 10 women entering  prison are sent there to serve sentences of six months or less.  Last year, one in four was sentenced to 30 days or less, and almost 300  women were given sentences of two weeks or less. That may sound short  but can be so disruptive that women lose their jobs, homes and contact  with their children. One in five women in prison is released without somewhere to live.  \n>  \n>And for what? The vast majority of women in prison have been sent there for non-violent offences. In the year to June 2017, more women were imprisoned to serve a sentence for theft than for violence, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and motoring offences combined.\n\n* Notice the sympathetic wording? Notice how they paint female criminals as undeserving of imprisonment?\n\n[https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/politics\/2018\/06\/26\/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent\/](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/politics\/2018\/06\/26\/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent\/)\n\n>**Women  should no longer be sent to prison unless they have committed a serious  crime,** the Justice Secretary says today, as he unveils a \"step change\"  in the way the justice system deals with female offenders.  \n>  \n>**Ministers want to \"break the cycle\" of sending women to jail** after it  emerged less than 40 women behind bars in England and Wales have  committed a violent offence and most others are serving just a few  months for crimes like shoplifting.  \n>  \n>David Gauke will today announce **plans for five new residential  women's centres where offenders will get help with drug and alcohol  problems, educational support and counselling instead of being locked  up.**","created_utc":1559861525000,"comment_id":"eq6ohoz","parent_id":"t3_bxeg8e","score":37,"submission_id":"bxeg8e"}

The only way to get your child back is to pay thousands for rights.    \n\nImagine how you would feel.   Imagine the pain, sorrow, and hardship you have to go through. \n\nThats what us alienated fathers deal with.  We as a society can make real change happen.  Men should automatically have the same rights the mothers have when they give birth.  In the intrest of equality.    I hope this post gets some sort of discussion or reactions.   And best case scenario, maybe change your views on family court and its corrupt laws againest fathers.\n\nHeres the kicker,   as we all know alot of people dont have money like that.

{"author":"angstyart","body":"It's discrimination either way. Girls do not get overall better grades in school. They **tend to** thrive in linguistic, abstract, and creative subjects, while boys **tend to** thrive in more practical and scientific subjects. Depending on the school and culture, a girl may or may not do better in school than the average male, because of how committed her school and society are to helping her learn. The same applies to males. [Many teachers have a bias about which subjects certain genders perform better in, and will not use as much time to help the other gender \"catch up.\"] (https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/07\/upshot\/how-elementary-school-teachers-biases-can-discourage-girls-from-math-and-science.html?_r=0). \n\nWith the \"wage gap,\" we also see that discrimination is a two-way street. The field I want to go into, psychology, usually holds about 3-4 women per male for every class. Even graduate schools, at the doctorate level, feature more women than men. On the other hand, computer science as a field features far more men. This is partly because of the processing differences between the genders, where women are more inclined to the linguistic, abstract, and creative aspects of life and men to practical, logical areas of life, and partly because employers and admission offices expect these inclinations to be the standard for those men and women that they meet. \n\nIn the mad dash to make up for the discrimination and general stupidity women have been treated with, American society (I speak of this one because it's where I'm from) is drastically neglecting male needs. Almost every aspect of life is beginning to look worse for men because people are not balancing things out, rather, they're skewing things towards women. The weird thing is, this is not the case for the older generation, which is still alive and still working. So there's awkward and massive shifts in treatment from field to field, company to company, etc. ","created_utc":1497749299000,"comment_id":"dj17or0","parent_id":"t3_6hsl4q","score":10,"submission_id":"6hsl4q"}
{"author":"Funcuz","body":"Girls tend to sit still and listen. Sorry, but as a teacher, that's my experience. Other than that, by the time they hit high school, boys are just as good.\n\nAs for the reason men earn more,...they don't. \n\nEdit: I see that some of you simply don't like the truth. Well, you spend every day teaching for years and then you can tell me that there's no difference between girls and boys.\n\nGirls *DO* sit still, hand in their homework, focus their attention better, and are eager to please. Boys don't tend to care and are rather self-absorbed. This all changes around puberty and the boys calm down while the girls get more \"chatty\".\n\nThere's no sense in trying to tailor the education system to every single student. That's not only impractical, it's beyond human capability. Frankly, it's better to go with the one-size-fits all approach and those that can't hack it get the help they need to fit in rather than trying to get special attention for every single child.\n\nEvery parent thinks that their child is special and deserves more than everybody else. They also don't think they're asking for anything out of the ordinary despite how ludicrous some of the demands I've heard have been. Probably the most common thing I hear is \"If you just spend more time with my child...\". No, actually, if *YOU* just spend more time with your child. Try that. \n\nNow, it doesn't help that the system, despite declaring itself unbiased, most definitely is. However, it doesn't always appeal to the females and not every male hates it. I personally couldn't stand most of the crap that I was forced to read in English class when I was in high-school, yet I still got a %97 on the final. Why? Because I wrote what I knew they wanted to hear and, like it or not, that's what school is.","created_utc":1497735681000,"comment_id":"dj0yerc","parent_id":"t3_6hsl4q","score":23,"submission_id":"6hsl4q"}

I really hope and pray that she serves all that time\n\nOne thing I noticed was how many commenters on this article found the sentence to be too long. These comments are each from different people:\n>This woman needs help. Obviously disturbed - but 25 years in prison is excessive. \n\nAs always, women can never be evil, they just \"need help\"\n\n>Jesus Christ, she's mentally disturbed and needs help.

{"author":"iainmf","body":"  [http:\/\/archive.fo\/towNU](http:\/\/archive.fo\/towNU) \n\n**Any thoughts on that** ***Thrones*** **feminism debate? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you asked about that before\u2026**\n\nI got asked in one of my first interviews: \u201cIs Arya a feminist?\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what a feminist was.\n\n**You were like 12!**\n\nAnd then someone explained it to me. And I remember thinking, \u201cIsn\u2019t that just like everyone?\u201d And then I realized everyone is not a feminist, unfortunately. But I also feel like we should stop calling feminists \u201cfeminists\u201d and just start calling people who *aren\u2019t* feminist \u201csexist\u201d \u2014 and then everyone else is just a human. You are either a normal person or a sexist. People get a label when they\u2019re bad. Because it works the other way, as well. A lot of men have it hard too. On the show specifically, it\u2019s always been a constant debate because women are treated badly on the show, and they\u2019re treated well on the show. But it\u2019s the same as the boys and the girls and the men and the animals. The themes are very dark. I get it that people don\u2019t want to watch scenes like that.\u00a0I understand, and you shouldn\u2019t have to. But that\u2019s the show that we\u2019ve made, and I have no control over what\u2019s written. I think it\u2019s upsetting that so many people have found it upsetting. But I find a lot of things upsetting to watch. I get upset when animals get slaughtered. And lots of people are like, \u201cBut *this* is worse than *that*\u201d \u2014 and I never understood that. I think everybody\u2019s allowed to be upset about what they\u2019re upset by. And once people are angry about something, you start worrying about saying the right thing instead of just saying what you mean. It\u2019s very easy to have an opinion. Everyone\u2019s got one. But it\u2019s very difficult to speak up about difficult subjects when people are angry with you. People say: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak up!\u201d \\[and I\u2019m thinking\\], \u201cBecause you all got pitchforks and you\u2019re ready to kill us!\u201d It\u2019s scary if you say something wrong.\n\n**When people are upset, it sometimes doesn\u2019t matter what you say \u2014 if don\u2019t agree with them, you\u2019ll just make them more angry.**\n\nExactly. And I don\u2019t want to be like, \u201cOh, people love to be angry,\u201d because people have a right to be upset about scenes that upset them \u2014 just as much as people have a right to laugh at things that made them happy. Maybe I just have to get a backbone. I\u2019m going to say this in this interview, but I wouldn\u2019t say it with anyone else: I sometimes really worry about speaking up about feminist subjects out of fear of being bashed by women on social media. And there\u2019s something not right there. Yeah, sometimes it\u2019s men too. But there are women who are just nasty. I\u2019m trying to do the best I can. I got a voice. I believe in equality and I know I have more power than the average person to reach people. And I just get petrified in case people are rude. You don\u2019t want to put yourself through that. If people are angry about \\[the Sansa Stark scene last year\\] you have to watch \\[the season 5 DVD\\] commentary because \\[writer-producer\\] Bryan Cogman [**speaks about it in depth and it\u2019s from the heart**](https:\/\/ew.com\/article\/2016\/02\/19\/game-thrones-season-5-dvd-sansa). I\u2019m a very sarcastic girl and can sound like a dick in interviews \u2014 people are like, \u201cWhy are you so annoying?\u201d In this you can hear his voice and it\u2019s so full of emotion.

They don't actually have any power over me and I don't have to live by their standards. \n\nWhen it's women who do it, however, and who do it not only from a position of power and sexual selection or a position of hypocrisy(because the standards they tell me to \"man up\" to, they do not meet themselves), they also come from a position of collusion(making assertions as though they were speaking for all women, if not just reasserting positions because they are commonly adopted by a female majority), then it becomes a lot harder to ignore. \n\nWhen it comes to this issue, or men being forced into stoicism or silence, I think people get too hung up on the word \"man up\".

In that way, everybody suffers, but on average, the suffering is canceled out in the overall BIGI score (leading to a good BIGI ranking).\n\nIn other words... men and women might both face mounds of inequality, but if we add it up, it's sort of a wash, in a shitty way. \n\nSo, as we might expect, the individual numbers for each factor in Saudi Arabia are all over the charts. However, when we average those numbers together, we *happen* to get a very low BIGI. A shitty wash. \n\n> The main conclusion is therefore that even when BIGI is zero, a country may still need to address several gender-specific inequalities.The study's description \n\nThat's putting it mildly. \n\nThat's also why I have a real problem with the article. It focuses heavily on the BIGI figure, despite the fact that the study's authors warn against that. In fact, the study treats the AADP figure as the most important one. The authors warn us to only consider the BIGI together with the AADP.\n\nThe Guardian article doesn't do that. As a result, someone reading the article (and seeing Saudi Arabia in 3rd) might reasonably conclude that the study is a pile of shit. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","created_utc":1546923242000,"comment_id":"edi7erh","parent_id":"t3_adhfsg","score":8,"submission_id":"adhfsg"}

It's a step in combating gendered societal pressure, which I distinctly recall is the purpose of this sub and the reason I subscribed.

{"author":"ANUS_CONE","body":"I just wanted to touch on this a little, because I'm glad that it's actually being said.\n\nOur society does not react equally to young boys and young girls being raped by adults of the opposite sex. A big part of the reason is because in most cases, these young, adolescent boys appear *proud* of what happened. They tout the act as an achievement of their advanced manliness. \n\nWhat people aren't paying attention to here, is that the fact that these boys seem so pleased, satisfied, and excited by the event is precisely **why** it is abuse. Adolescent boys have just discovered their sex drives. Many have just discovered masturbation and learned about sex. Many are crazed with the idea of it. It's a natural part of growing up as a male, and it's all caused by testosterone. It's biologically part of being a young male. \n\nImagine a homeless person who hasn't eaten in a week. They're fucking hungry. They are willing to do some stupid shit for a bite of food. They're willing to eat food from derelict places. They're willing to take risks with what they eat that a normal person wouldn't. \n\nSexually, an 11 year old boy is very similar to this homeless person. He doesn't have the maturity or the capacity to understand what's happening to his body. A fully matured adult female offering to have sex with him would be the metaphorical equivalent of offering this homeless person a free trip to an all-you-can-eat buffet. Except you haven't told him that all of the food is poisoned. \n\nThese boys end up with their own set of sexual consequences for the rest of their lives because of this shit. It might not be the exact same as what a little girl would deal with, but they're going to be fucked up. And the chances of them doing something fucked up to someone else then become way higher.

And, that decrease in women's risk compared with men's statistically significant decrease had resulted in an equal risk of stroke between men and women currently.

{"author":"Alyscupcakes","body":"Why people attempt suicide is typically always stemmed from a feeling of hopelessness. (if not psychosis) Almost always impulsive, set off from a trigger(s) that feels like an irrevocable situation. \n\nThere is a higher risk of suicide attempt in the short term for individuals:\n\n* a significant loss, such as the death of a spouse or the loss of a job\n\n* loss of social support, for example, because of a move or when a close friend relocates\n\n* a personal crisis or life stress, especially one that increases a sense of isolation or leads to a loss of self-esteem, such as a separation or divorce\n\n* an illness or medication that triggers a change in mood\n\n* exposure to the suicidal behaviors of others, such as friends, peers, or celebrities\n\n* sudden financial despair caused by uncontrollable situations (typically medical bills) \n\n\n**If we want to reduce suicide overall:**\n\nOverall as a society, we should place a higher emphasis on safety nets to reduce stressful life situations. We as a society should provide free mental health sessions during stressful life events, and encourage use. Perhaps life coaches to guide individuals out of disparaging situations, to reduce hopelessness. \n\n**If you are feeling suicidal, I urge you to call the suicide hotline where you live.** \n\nThere are people who can help you get through your hopeless situation.\n\nArgentina: +5402234930430\n\nAustralia: 131114\n\nAustria: 017133374\n\nBelgium: 106\n\nBosnia & Herzegovina: 080 05 03 05\n\nBotswana: 3911270\n\nBrazil: 212339191\n\nCanada: 5147234000 (Montreal); 18662773553 (outside Montreal)\n\nCroatia: 014833888\n\nDenmark: +4570201201\n\nEgypt: 7621602\n\nEstonia: 3726558088; in Russian 3726555688\n\nFinland: 010 195 202\n\nFrance: 0145394000\n\nGermany: 08001810771\n\nHolland: 09000767\n\nHong Kong: +852 2382 0000\n\nHungary: 116123\n\nIndia: 8888817666\n\nIreland: +4408457909090\n\nItaly: 800860022\n\nJapan: +810352869090\n\nMexico: 5255102550\n\nNew Zealand: 0800543354\n\nNorway: +4781533300\n\nPhilippines: 028969191\n\nPoland: 5270000\n\nPortugal: 21 854 07 40\/8 . 96 898 21 50\n\nRussia: 0078202577577\n\nSpain: 914590050\n\nSouth Africa: 0514445691\n\nSweden: 46317112400\n\nSwitzerland: 143\n\nUnited Kingdom: 08457909090\n\nUSA: 18002738255","created_utc":1536986473000,"comment_id":"e5zja6c","parent_id":"t3_9fr37o","score":5,"submission_id":"9fr37o"}

A lot of, \"if you do this, you are in the wrong\". He then started talking about men, being sexual assaulted. At this point in my life, I had never considered that. Young boys, sure, that was in the news and I had been through the whole \"stranger dangers\" thing, but a man, like my dad, being raped. Didn't seem possible. Really with that very immature thinking around \"Why wouldn't I WANT to be raped\". Cause sex is sex, right?\n\nThe cop went on to tell a story about 2 women in London picking up men and raping them in the back of a van. A lot of hushed giggles - myself included - but one older boy was a little louder and made some a joke. Don't recall what it was. \n\nThe cop stopped, walked over to him, made his hand into the shape of a gun and put it in the middle of his forehead and asked him \"What would you do, if someone had you like this, and told you to \"get hard now, or die?\"\". \n\nThat made it quite clear to me.

{"author":"Halafax","body":"Keep in mind, Johnny is rich and famous.  He has the resources to fight, many (most) men don\u2019t.  He\u2019s willing to go through the process to fight for his reputation, it\u2019s a brutal process.  Most guys can\u2019t do this.  \n\nDepp got torn apart.  He\u2019s got his ex abusing him on video, and still lost.  \n\nIf a movie star can\u2019t get a fair divorce, what do you think happens to regular guys?  To you?\n\n\u201cFamily court isn\u2019t fair to men\u201d is shorthand for a mountain of cultural biases that individually, are probably solvable.  Taken all together at the same time, it\u2019s like trying to push the tide back.  Not just impossible, but futile.  This is \u201ctoxic expectations on men\u201d  but feminists will fight to their dying breath to keep these expectations in place. \n\nThe court is an expression of the community.  The law probably came from somewhere else, but the judge and the lawyers all golf in the same social circles.  The court wants you off it\u2019s docket with as little cost to the state as possible.  The lawyers want paid, they know how to get money out of men, and don\u2019t want to kill the golden goose.  The police, the support agencies, even the help lines have a cozy little understanding of how things should go, and they aren\u2019t going to make an exception for you.  \n\nIf you insist, do all the things they say will help.  Get a pre-nup.  Hire his and hers lawyers to review it.  Understand that trying to invalidate that pre-nup gets more attractive to lawyers as your value rises.  The better you do, the more vulnerable you are.  \n\nMarrying a woman that makes less than you makes you vulnerable.  Making more than your wife after marriage makes you vulnerable.  Your wife leaving her career to care for children makes you vulnerable.  Taking a job that is farther away, requires longer hours, or is physically debilitating makes you vulnerable.  The court only cares about a man\u2019s ability to earn, just like society does.  If you sacrifice to be successful, you are fucked.  The court reduces your existence to your earning potential.  It doesn\u2019t care why you were making those sacrifices. \n\nIf you must, go in understanding how and why you aren\u2019t going to get a fair resolution.  Keep the risk large in your mind every time you make a life altering decision.","created_utc":1624692283000,"comment_id":"h31uvjx","parent_id":"t3_o7uvoq","score":416,"submission_id":"o7uvoq"}

{"author":"reignkaera","body":"A couple of weeks ago(maybe months now?) there was a discussion on twitter on why so many major media outlets continue to paint Johnny Depp in a negative light and keepon supporting\/making Amber Heard look good. Even after the audios were released, there was silence. But if there's something bad against JD, many publish it. This includes Variety. Now Adam Waldman dropped hints that we should follow the money to find the reason why they are so hell bent on taking JD down. Disclaimer, I am not clear on this and it is quite difficult because one would need a huuuge white board to make all the connections but there were some who were able to do it by cross referencing news articles and profiles on these people. I highly encourage that you dig into it yourself and don't take my word for it. For mine's a really poor explanation.\n Remember JD having hundreds of millions (?) stolen from him by his former management team TMG? Some have theorized it went to the Saudis, investment of sorts. Look into who owns Variety, and who got a major investment on them recently. IIRC 400million dollars. Rolling stone magazine is owned by the same company. Remember that hit piece on JD after the allegations came out? The sun's  owner, has a family member in the tesla board. Etc.\n\nIn short, Amber might be a psycho who set out to destroy her husband but she was not able to do it by herself. Until now, there seems to be a lot of influential people backing her. Be mindful of the headlines and you will notice it too. Plus an actress worth 9mil being able to afford an army of lawyers plus PR teams etc. I am still trying to find out more, and if you have more info you'd like to share, I'm open to discussion.

{"author":"samarye","body":"Auburn Safe Harbor's FAQ emphasizes that they provide all of their services and referrals for male survivors as well as females.  Also, the decision to include female-on-male violence in the campaign the OP spotted is certainly good.\n\nThere are some problems with the Auburn Safe Harbor program's [website](https:\/\/fp.auburn.edu\/studentaffairs\/healthandwellness\/programs\/safeharbor\/).  The \"Definitions\" page includes an old version of Alabama's first degree rape statute that says only men can be rapists; this law has been changed.  Also, the site has a section entitled \"Why Men Should Care\" that bizarrely fails to mention that men can be victims of domestic violence and sexual assault and instead warns that men could be \"vulnerable to inquiry by law enforcement.\"\n\nBetween the Auburn Safe Harbor site and the [DVAM site](http:\/\/www.auburn.edu\/dvam) advertised on the poster, it seems like Auburn's trying to make a transition to acknowledging and addressing male survivors and female perpetrators of domestic violence and sexual assault. However, they're starting from the male-on-female violence narrative and still have a ways to go.

{"author":"Meyright2","body":"Transcript:\n\n>If 93% of workplace deaths were black people, we'd have no problem at all understanding that society is deeply and institutionally racist. If gay people were twice as likely to be victims of violent assault during their lifetimes, we'd all suspect our culture had some disturbingly homophobic elements. If women were several times more likely to commit suicide, we'd have no problem understanding that the world is probably a sexist, hostile and unsympathetic place for them.\n\n>Society has a huge mental block when dealing with men's issues. This empathy gap underlies all men's issues. It makes us blind to the ways which men are \u2014 yes - institutionally oppressed. Humanity is hard\u2014wired and culturally conditioned to care more about women than men. It makes evolutionary sense: Tribes that value the reproductive value of women more than the utility of men will always prosper more than those that have their priorities the other way around. The same kind of forces were to blame for society undervalueing women\u2018s utility as anything other than baby\u2014makers in the centuries gone by. But we got past that.\n\n>Feminism helped the world see that women are worth more than their uteri. But we still only measure men's worth by their utility. If any gender equality movement will help us see that men have value beyond their worth as mules and cannon fodder, it sure as hell won\u2018t be the movement that's done nothing but demonise and blame men for all the world's problems in the past century; the movement that's campaigned against father's custody rights; the movement that's currently pressing for all women's prisons to be closed, despite women already receiving more lenient sentences than men; the movement that calls it rape when a man has sex with a drunk woman, but not when a woman has sex with a drunk man; the movement that wants to put gender quotas on the top political and business positions, but couldn't care less about getting quotas on the worst and most dangerous jobs that men dominate; the supremacist movement that tells us \"the world would be better if women were in charge\"; the movement that still presses for more funding to be diverted to educational programmes for girls and medical resource allocation despite women already doing better on both these fronts.\n\n>Feminism will not be the movement to address men's issues. In the decades that it\u2018s been the status-quo, it has done nothing to help men except in ways that also help women (paternity leave is arguably a bigger women's issue than it is a men's issue). The death gap in the workplace in the 1960s was almost exactly the same as it is today. Men have never been less valued or more despised, and feminism is strongly implicated. It will take a movement that doesn't wish to eradicate masculinity from the world. It will take a movement that allows men to de\ufb01ne for themselves what it means to be a man.\n\n>We can either have a future where feminists and men's rights activists \ufb01ght it out, or we can all start calling ourselves \"equalists\". Feminism is not about equality. The clue is in the name.","created_utc":1557949044000,"comment_id":"enln5fw","parent_id":"t3_bowccv","score":158,"submission_id":"bowccv"}

It's frustrating and I imagine she got caught up in the heat an acted like an ass.   Just like when Rodgers claimed the hit on him by Barr last year was \"dirty.\"\n\nSeems we have two tennis players that have carried on with their lives and two screaming piles of idiots.

{"author":"mhandanna","body":"She has some other clips of her shutting down bullshit victim narrative feminist concepts.\n\nMMA is probably the major sport with most gender parity - women are not add ons, they are regularly the main draw on a card (UFC works so you have events with a bunch of fights, usually one main box office fight and several other fights with other people and women often are the main draws in these cards - **the key thing is this is natural - its not some equality of outcome** fake bull crap like they do in tennis or well the entire feminists dogma pretty much, the women have earned this on merit)\n\nCompare to tennis, where feminsits claim it is equal, but it is not, women are paid the same as men completelty artificially and using an equality of outcome method (they are even placed on main stadiums INSTEAD of men for equlity of outcome reaons even though the main draw is the men).... they draw around 1\/5th of the interest, ad revenue, sponsorhip, ticket sales (if it wasn't for them competing at same time and venue as men, this would be even less) yet get equal pay and keep crying sexism when it is literally the opposite, their sex is getting them massive benifits that are unearned.... yes I know they also play 3 sets compared to the mens 5 sets, but that to me isn't massively relevant, you dont pay by the hour (although it has some relevance as it allows women to play in doubles too, to earn even more money, while top men cannot play in doubles as it would hinder their singles performance, so top female players actually end up earning more than men at least from prize money)... also men being better at tennis has nothing to do with it, I have no issue with female players getting paid more than men if the opposite was true e.g. female tennis players were bringing in more ad revenue, ticket sales, etc.....\n\n**I think this is a point about MRA alot of feminists dont understand and massively hypocrtical on.... Like many MRAs im not an MRA or point out MRA issues cos im looking out for mens interests, I dont have  bias towards either gender. I point the issues out due to fairness i.e. a more egalitarian appraoch... if women were bringing in more ad revenue, interest, ticket sales, and basically carrying the whole show but men were being paid the same as women, Id be the first to point out WTF is going on here, that is not fair and women should be earning far more.**\n\n**Feminism is the exact opposite. Many feminsits have enromous bias towards women, many are flat out female supremacists, and a sizeble minorty are radical seperatists who want to kill all men essentially.** When looking at family law, education, health, I dont care about favouring men, Im not there to make pro male laws or male only scholarships (there are 11 female only schoarlships per 1 male one despite women being majority in university), Im interested in these issues due to the inequality regardless of gender, like many if not most MRAs I have no pro male bias, Id be saying the same thing if education was stacked against women for example (compared to feminsits, who may at best pay lip service, oh look male suicide, but ultiamtely are female supremacists and postiely view female supremacy laws and funding etc, and would never support affrimative action type things for men but massively do for women).... which is why so many MRAs are actually ex feminsits, its when they realised feminism wasn't about equality they left.","created_utc":1596917975000,"comment_id":"g0s71u3","parent_id":"t3_i5wahh","score":121,"submission_id":"i5wahh"}

{"author":"WillMeatLover","body":"Okay, that's actually not the full story, that your only worth is how much money you make the company. People do have some human value and they do also just have what is owed\/promised to them regardless of business decisions that do or do not lead to profit.\n\nIf I promise my employees or contractors a certain pay in exchange for a certain labour, I owe that to them whether or not a business succeeds.\n\nOf course, that's because managing a business is actually a huge job and not an easy ride like so many idiots think. And also because it's very unusual for a business to depend mostly or entirely on a single party when that party isn't the owner itself (usually in the case of a 1 man operation or near it).\n\nI mean, obviously the whole thing with the women's football team is the selfish whining of useless bitches who don't appreciate that their whole life is a gift. Maybe they should be better than a boy's high school team if they want respect and compensation.\n\nI just don't like leaving the assertion that an employee's ONLY value is the income they bring to a business unaddressed. Capitalism is an economic policy. It's a tool in the box for a man to draw upon. It's not a god damn life philosophy that guides each and every life decision.

{"author":"timeslidesRD","body":"This has always annoyed me massively. WHY should men, by default be expected to always leave the seat in the position women want and not vice versa, or more fairly, just leave it in whatever position you've put it in to use it, and the next person adjusts it to their requirements, and so on.   \n\n\nThe current societal stance, is that men put the toilet seat down. This means, that when a man uses the toilet the operating steps are:-  \n\n\n1. Lift toilet seat\n2. Pee\n3. Replace toilet seat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVersus when a woman use the toilet, operating steps are:-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Pee\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 steps for men, 1 step for women. Obviously this is not 'fair'. So, as I mentioned, the optimum operating procedure should be to just leave it in the position you used it, and the next user adjusts it to their requirements. Assuming the previous user was a member of the opposite sex, the operating steps would be:-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMen\n\n1. Lift toilet seat\n2. Pee\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWomen\n\n1. Replace toilet seat\n2. Pee\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, exactly equal work and equal treatment. Which is what women are all about in today's world, so I have no idea why they wouldn't support this. In the instance that the previous user was of the same sex, happy days! All you have to do is pee. So with the 'leave it as you used it' procedure, both sexes have a max of 2 steps to complete, and often will only have to pee and nothing else. The current societal stance requires men to perform 3 steps every single time, and women to have 1 step every single time.

{"author":"orangeLILpumpkin","body":"\"False claims\" is starting to be as ambiguous as \"sexual assault\".  We need to work towards better and more concise language with meanings that everyone will understand and agree to.\n\nWhen someone says \"I was sexually assaulted\", we don't really know what that means.  Assuming they aren't outright lying, we know that *something* happened to them that they were uncomfortable with and that they considered that \"something\" to be of a sexual nature.  But we don't know if someone accidentally brushed against them on a crowded train, looked at them in a manner they found unpleasant, or were violently raped by a stranger jumping out of the woods.\n\nWe're in a similar place when we talk about false claims.  I don't really know much of the details of what happened that resulted in the false claims.  All of the following are false claims, but - much like the differing types of \"sexual assault\" - there is a very different approach to each of them.\n\n1. Outright lying and making up a claim of rape or sexual assault out of absolutely nothing.\n\n2. Misrepresenting facts (lying) about something that actually did happen, but calling it sexual assault when it was consensual.\n\n3. Misinterpreting actions that weren't sexual assault, but were genuinely deemed to be sexual assault by the accuser because of their misinterpretation.\n\n4. Understanding fully actions that were taken, and calling them sexual assault even when that set of actions\/facts don't constitute sexual assault (i.e., not understand the definition of sexual assault).  This could be done either out of ignorance or out of malice.\n\n5. Making an accusation of sexual assault and having everything 100% correct, but identifying the wrong person as the assaulter.\n\nI'm sure there are more examples, but when we use the broad term of \"false accusation\", it is getting kind of meaningless.\n","created_utc":1539041746000,"comment_id":"e7e9zgi","parent_id":"t3_9megsz","score":67,"submission_id":"9megsz"}

{"author":"svnglife","body":"Maybe this will shed some clarity\u2026\n\nWhen I was arrested, I was arrested months before Covid-19 peaked in 2020. The courts were closed and the \u201cspeedy trial\u201d rights for my state were suspended by the Supreme Court of my state. So I sat there waiting to be seen by a judge, on no bail. Given the nature of the accusation, they all believed her. So I was denied bond. In my state, we have a speedy trial rule that says after the preliminary hearing, I have to have a trial done within 5 months (if I\u2019m held without bond) and 9 months (if I\u2019m out on bond)\u2026. But like I said that was suspended during Covid-19. The speedy trial right guaranteed by the 6th amendment of the US doesn\u2019t specifically say when a trial is to commence\u2026. So i was just a victim of being fucked by the legal system and I got forgotten\u2026 I was appointed an AMAZING attorney who killed all this shit, I\u2019m so thankful. But like I said in another comment, I was active duty Navy before I was arrested but my command didn\u2019t believe anything that was said so they put me on \u201clegal hold\u201d and stopped my pay\u2026 now that I\u2019ve been exonerated fully, my pay with the military has been continued AND I get a fat back pay check for the 30 months that I was gone\u2026\n\nYes, I have a very very strong case in federal court against the detective that is soon to go public, most likely the detective will be fired and the city of the state I live in will settle the case so it doesn\u2019t get too much publicity\u2026\n\nYes I\u2019m suing my accuser, but she doesn\u2019t have shit, but all this will be on her record, I can\u2019t press charges for falsifying a police report, only the cops can do that. ..\n\nI hope this clears everything for you guys\u2026 your comments and nice words are seriously helping me right now SO MUCH.

{"author":"TheSquiggy","body":"I'm so sorry this happened to you brother.\n\nI was lucky enough to avoid jail - if only because my ex was more interested in drugs than giving a consistent statement.\n\nOur relationship was entirely predicated on her using fake pregnancy scares and threats of false allegations rape or violence intermingled between her violent outbursts - for which I was arrested, but never charged. She'd recant her statement if I agreed to stay with her.  I never so much as laid a finger on her in anger. Not once.\n\nAt the end of it all, I lost two shitty jobs, nearly every friend I had in the world, and any hope of normalcy for the rest of my life.\n\nEven after someone recorded her drunkedly confessing to making it all up, not just about me, but two other men - one of which had shot himself, I remained a pariah.  The closure was a huge relief for me, but even with the recording making the rounds slowly, it didn't restore what I'd lost. \n\nI was unceremoniously uninvited from my 10 year and 20 year high school reunion. \n\nMost people from that era of my life are still unwilling to speak to, or be associated with me in any way.\n\nI've been denied jobs still because the arrests show up on background checks for security clearance.\n\nI'm so far removed from all of it now - but every now and again, someone who knows me as 'that guy' will pop up from no where, and tell others in my social circles about what they heard about me from long ago.  Some buy it, some don't, none look at me the same.\n\nI'm glad you've got the legal record to prove your innocence OP. \n\nI won't lie, even with that ammunition on your belt, it's a tough road.

{"author":"overthinking_gypsy","body":"This hits home hard for me today. \n\nI joined this sub to gain a better insight into men's rights. I consider myself an advocate of Women's Rights issues. I struggle with this mindset however and I see it often.\n\nI had a friend come over on Sunday morning for coffee and she told me about her adventures with a man the night before. They had gone and done things a few times before and had slept together once in the past.  She had said that he had said no to sleeping with her but eventually gave in. She told me that she told him that she could just pick up the phone and call someone else if he wasn't up to It, that he should man up..... she asked what kind of monster didn't want to have sex if it was available, and she asked if he had problems getting it up.... From what she said, this went on for quite some time. They slept together eventually.\n\nAfter listening, I told her about an ex who threw a full on temper tantrum when I said no to sex. He was a nightmare and after 2 hours, I gave in and had sex with him to make the madness stop. I told her that his coercion (anger, threats, name calling, relentless demands, pouting, pleading, refusing to leave without sex, etc...) was a form of sexual assault. The only way that I saw out of the situation at the time, as peacefully as possible, was to sleep with him.\n\nShe asked me if I thought that she had sexually assaulted this man. I told her if she used threats, begging, emotional abuse, pouting, refusing to leave the situation or refusing to let him leave etc... if she pressured him into changing his no to a yes even knowing he didn't want to, than she sexually assaulted him. I told her bullying anyone into sex was wrong. \n\nHer response was to laugh and make a joke around the lines of, \"It's not a man's world now, is it?\" And, \"I don't think he minded so much because he wouldn't have gotten hard if he didn't want to use it.\" ..... \"I bet he isnt complaining today!\" I made it clear that if the tables were turned, there would be no excuse in the world that would make it okay for a man to do this to a woman, or to say things like this about it.\n\nShe knew she screwed up and asked me again if I thought she assaulted him. I said I wasn't there but if she had to ask whether or not she assaulted him, there was obviously an issue. I suggested that she be in touch with him, talk to him and sort it out as best she could. She agreed.\n\nI went later that evening to have a conversation with the man. Her apology was this: \"I'm sorry if I was too blunt about wanting sex. Had a great time..hope to see you soon and do that again.\"  He was sickened by the whole thing. His son was home and he didnt want to create chaos or drama, so he had been trying to keep it a mellow situation. She kept escalating it every time he tried to explain why he didnt want to have sex.He was mad at himself for giving in to pressure as though he had to prove himself worthy of his time. He felt used and violated. He told me that he didnt feel like he was valued as a person by her because she only wanted one thing. He was also mad at himself for not enjoying it because men \"should be all about getting laid anytime\". \n\nI asked him if he wanted to go to the police and that I was willing to do up a statement for him, that what happened was wrong and I was sorry he was pressured and violated. He refused and said, \"What MAN goes to the police because of something like this? I'd just be the fucking pussy that they'd make fun of as soon as I left\".\n\nThis shit pisses me off and it's safe to say I am down a friend. While I can say that more sexual assaults happen to women without a doubt, that does not take away from the fact that men are also assaulted. Most women don't report these, myself included over the years. In fairness to men, they report even less because of the stereotype that all men want sex all the time so it isn't assault. \n\nThat friend is not a feminist. A feminist can still have empathy and respect for men. Anyone should be able to recognize that crime is something punishable regardless of gender. She tried to explain her behavior away by saying it was okay because it happened to a man, so it wasn't as wrong or damaging.\n\nI feel upset sometimes that I am lumped in with memes like this when that is not at all who I am. Am I a feminist? I'd like to think so.....But I sure as hell don't agree with this attitude and, unfortunately, I see it way too much.","created_utc":1567742018000,"comment_id":"ez6li5z","parent_id":"t3_d01c8d","score":186,"submission_id":"d01c8d"}

{"author":"Lendari","body":"Ignoring the fact that codifying wage discrimination based on gender contradicts federal labor laws, it's obvious that whoever wrote this doesn't seem to have any real experience with economic policy.\n\nIf this actually went into effect, it would probably benefit unemployed men willing to work for minimum wage the most. Effectively a men's job program. The reason is because if there was a higher minimum wage for women, employers would simply favor hiring the candidates who asked for a lower wage. Which by coincidence would happen to be men. Expressing a preference for a qualified candidate who asks for lower salary is totally legal. To get the presumably intended effect of \"paying only women more for the same work\" they would need to institute hiring quotas for minimum wage earning women, which would also be in contradiction with federal labor laws.\n\nI love that the person who wrote this believes that in order for a policy to be \"feminist\", only women can benefit from it. If the minimum wage was raised for everyone, women would benefit disproportionately to men because women are more likely than men to accept minimum wage jobs and part-time work in the first place. This is a major explanatory factor of \"the gender pay gap\" in the first place, especially the figures touted by Obama\/Warren based on statistics that compare all men to all women and ignore details like hours worked per week and years of consecutive experience in the same field.","created_utc":1596673221000,"comment_id":"g0gjwwu","parent_id":"t3_i46b3x","score":63,"submission_id":"i46b3x"}

It's not that nobody cares about prostate cancer, it's that breast cancer is comparatively very easy to screen for and treat. The effectiveness in saving lives is tremendous.

Arguing with a coffee shop feminist on reddit with no power and likely no even real yniderstanding of feminism is\" HIGH effort, LOW yield result\" work.... a 10 minute letter to a company, organisation, school or whatever maybe correcting a journalist on false stats etc is low\/moderate effort higher yield... also the positive effect you get when you send a letter and get a reply (and you usually do get a good reply, dont listen to negativity here) reinforces you to do it again.... then post your letter here, which encourages others... see 10x better use of your time than debating Brenda the coffee shop feminist on reddit. I admit I post a lot, but im doing it on breaks and I do enjoy it.  \nAlso remember when you debate, you are debating for the audience NOT the radical (who is unlikely to change their mind).... thats why be polite, dont lose it, and it doesnt matter if they dont agree, you are arguing for the moderates who will see your argument laid out..... this how people are red pilled  \nAlso see here:  \n[https:\/\/becauseits2015.wordpress.com\/2020\/02\/16\/best-practices-for-debating-feminists\/](https:\/\/becauseits2015.wordpress.com\/2020\/02\/16\/best-practices-for-debating-feminists\/)  \nBut as I said, dont waste your time doing it, no point!!\n\nHere Is The Copy and Paste Post:\n\nNote: No this post is not trying to \"debunk\" womens issues in health, they have many legitimate issues in healthcare.

A large nationwide review, which examined 46,868 office visits, revealed that the care received by men and women was similar about two-thirds of the time. When the care was different, women overall received more diagnostic tests and treatment \u2014 more lab tests, blood-pressure checks, drug prescriptions, and return appointments.In the United States, we spend twice as much on the healthcare of women than on that of men. Even if you exclude obstetrical care, females at every age receive more medical attention than males.

See the link above about the gender health gap, part of it is biological e.g. more boys are still born, or infant boys die etc... shouldn't healthcare apply \"postive discrimination towards men\"?.... or is this a case of one rule for me, but not for thee? Now not only is this rule not applied, of course the exact OPPOSITE is true \"the privelged gender\" ie.e women, actually have far more healthcare, spending, services, research... see all the links for absolute crystal facts not just \"yeah but my anecdote\" only 2% of countries have a men health policy and all WHO, UN goals are all related to the \"privileged genders\" health with 0 for men (again see cold hard data in links above, not \"yeah but by anecdote\")***","created_utc":1610203925000,"comment_id":"gimu4kh","parent_id":"t3_ktlc4f","score":41,"submission_id":"ktlc4f"}

{"author":"aluciddreamer","body":"One of my co-workers has been working overtime for the last seven years. At least once a year, his ex (the mother of his child), takes him to court and tries to raise child support. Every year thus far, the judge has listened to his ex complain that he hasn't been seeing his daughter and that he isn't paying enough. The judge then looks at his income, sees the amount of overtime he made in the interval between now and the last time he was in family court, and awards her more money. He has attempted to explain his situation many times, and each time the judge has been dismissive. \n\nWe work twelve-hour shifts, and he has to work eleven shifts every pay period in order to pay his bills. He's trying to push it down so that he won't have as much, and he's working with a lawyer to help get it resolved, but in the meantime he's struggling despite working more than anyone should ever have to work. Meanwhile, his ex has a habit of deliberately forcing him to reschedule the little time that he has to spend with his kid, and will go out of her way to try and reschedule for days that she knows he's working. Then if he can't make it, she'll use this against him when they go back to mediation. Just hearing about it made me seethe with hatred. Last I heard, his new attorney sounded promising and he was going out of his way to keep meticulous documents. But the last lawyer he worked with basically just kept silent and didn't advocate on his behalf in the slightest, and stopped him from interjecting or speaking out. He went along with it, thinking the lawyer had some card he was going to play, only to have his child support raised on the basis of his previous earnings. The lawyer later explained that the judge was in a hurry and that it wasn't wise to press the issue.\n\nEvery time I think about this guy, it ties me up in knots. How is it that we've all just signed off on a system that affords so much power to someone who can make your life a living hell because they had a bad day?\n\nTo make things worse, if you regularly work OT, the supervisors will start to rely on you to accept overtime when they call, and may stonewall you if you refuse. And it's not like his job is a cakewalk either, we work in a correctional facility, so there are times when he may be called to respond to a use of force and put himself in danger.\n\nIt has been a while since I asked him about how it went. Last I heard, the date got pushed back. But I really hope he gets this ironed out. The guy has told me that he's often given less than a minute or two to state his case, and his ex uses this time to interrupt while he fumbles to explain that the judge is not reviewing his regular earnings and that he has to work extra hours to meet the demands of the court. Once, the judge got flustered while trying to do basic math and then arbitrarily raised his child support. \n\nThe system is fucked.\n","created_utc":1530803614000,"comment_id":"e1tjqqw","parent_id":"t3_8w6c79","score":174,"submission_id":"8w6c79"}

If she does sign for the letter, then he will receive a little green card (if in the United States).

In the past, men were always expected to be money makers in the family. By making money, men could more easily attract a mate. Money had an added incentive. In modern times, this incentive is disappearing. I just wonder what is going to fill this void. I say in America we need to switch to a more european style of work ethic for modern times perhaps. If money isnt going to hold as much value in my life as a male, then i should have the choice to not work as much. This seems fair.

{"author":"89peters","body":"Little known fact: over half of the people released under the Innocence Project were men falsely accused of rape.   And most of those weren't even he said\/she said but cases of mistaken identity.   Meanwhile feminists claim that rape conviction rates are \"too low\" (they are completely unconcerned about conviction rates for women accused of various crimes, and indeed seem to welcome the institutional privilege afforded women in the criminal justice system).     \n\nIn the UK, political pressure by feminists to increase conviction rates has resulted in police with-holding exculpatory evidence in rape trials, leading to innocent men being sent to prison.   This should have been a huge, international scandal.  \n\nOne would assume, at this point, that feminists would re-evaluate their position and recognize that false accusations exist, but no, similar campaigns are underway in other countries.  \n\nIn Canada, the media personality Jian Ghomeshi was falsely accused of rape by several jilted ex lovers, who conspired to frame him.   This was exposed in court via email and text messages, and Ghomeshi exonerated.   Or at least he *should* have been exonerated.   While he was declared not guilty, and despite all evidence to the contrary, he is still guilty in the feminist-controlled court of public opinion.   Feminists simply interpreted his acquittal as evidence that the legal system protects rapists.   They are in the process of pushing through a new law that will (a) make it more difficult to introduce exculpatory evidence in rape trials (coincidentally, email and text messages) and (b) require the defense to hand over all such exculpatory evidence to the Crown, so accusers can get their stories straight).   They are also encouraging alleged rape victims to pursue the matter in Canada's Soviet style \"human rights tribunals\" in order to receive cash payouts.   \n\nThere is only one conclusion to be reached from this, in case it wasn't already obvious via MeToo and college Kangaroo courts: feminists do NOT believe in the bedrock legal concepts of presumption of innocence and due process rights -- at least when it comes to a man accused of something by a woman.  They are therefore the enemies of justice and civil society.   \n\nBrendan O'Neill wrote a must-read article for the left-libertarian website Spiked titled [*The war on rape: the logic of the lynch mob returns*](http:\/\/www.spiked-online.com\/newsite\/article\/the-war-on-rape-the-logic-of-the-lynch-mob-returns\/16349).   He notes that the feminist arguments about \"rape culture\" are virtually identical to the arguments made by the Ku Klux Klan (and their sizable women's auxiliary) about \"black rape culture\" a hundred years ago.   It's chilling, chilling stuff.  \n\n>Automatic belief of rape accusations was a central principle of the KKK\u2019s war on rape, too. This was one of the things that most shocked Ida B Wells, the early twentieth-century African-American journalist and civil-rights activist. \u2018The word of the accuser is held to be true\u2019, she said, which means that \u2018the rule of law [is] reversed, and instead of proving the accused to be guilty, the [accused] must prove himself innocent\u2019. Wells and others were startled by the level of belief in the accusers of black men, and by the damning of anyone who dared to question such accusations, which was taken as an attack on the accuser\u2019s \u2018virtue\u2019. The great nineteenth-century African-American reformer Frederick Douglass was disturbed by the mob\u2019s instant acceptance of accusations of rape against black men, where \u2018the charge once fairly stated, no matter by whom or in what manner, whether well or ill-founded\u2019, was automatically believed. Wells said she was praying that \u2018the time may speedily come when no human being shall be condemned without due process of law\u2019.

Just because of rumors of hygiene and preventing STDs and just for looks. Such a hypocrite don't tell me what to do with my body! But I have a right to physically change and alter my own child's body before they could even give permission. Such an unnecessary procedure. Men who are not circumcised have more sensation and it can be less painful for the woman if they already have painful sex. My husband's is uncircumcised and thank goodness for his mother's decision to say no. It's simple clean your dick everyday. If there's not going to be a damn law in place to protect young baby boys. Mother should be forced to watch a video like in an abortion clinic. Show them pictures and videos of people getting interviewed who have been affected by being circumcised. Why is it not okay for baby girls to be circumcised but it's okay for boys to be circumcised! People just need to f****** think.

{"author":"javastripped","body":"This is a bit of an unfair comparison.\n\nMales have a competitive advantage over females due to higher testosterone production.\n\nThat's a scientific fact.  You may not like it but it's true. \n\nMales dominate in sports because they're 'doping'.  Though they're doing so naturally.\n\nIf a GIRL enters a sport dominated by men it would be surprising to see that she did well.  Because she is a female and either has higher testosterone than average females (which is possible) OR she is extremely talented.\n\nBut if a male joins a female sports league he is at an advantage.  He's going to be faster, stronger, and quicker than his female competitors.\n\nThis isn't to be mean to female athletes.  It's just a matter of scientific reality.\n\nIt's the EXACT same reason that we break out age in sports as well.  I'm 36 and still have high testosterone for my age but NO WHERE NEAR an 18 year old.  \n\nThis would be very similar to an 18 year old deciding he would compete in the 35-40 age range and dominating.\n\nOf course he would dominate.  He has a MAJOR competitive advantage.\n\nSource: I'm an athlete and very interested in doping, performance enhancement, and longevity.  \n\nEDIT.  Males have been competing and dominating in 'breast cancer awareness' runs which are dominated by females.  It's nearly 100% females and males are discouraged to join.  It's ILLEGAL to prevent them so a few males have been running (probably because they have a mother, daughter, or wife that has breast cancer) ... and they are winning.\n\n","created_utc":1355826062000,"comment_id":"c7ia936","parent_id":"t3_150o7u","score":1069,"submission_id":"150o7u"}

Should this entire national campaign be made about a girl physically dominating boys at an age where she is almost surely more physically advanced than every boy she is playing against?  Not in the fucking least.  She's got one, maybe two more years tops before she can't even stay on the same field as them.  I sincerely hope that she continues in sports after that, because she is clearly a very gifted athlete, but I am definitely worried about what might happen to her self-esteem and drive to continue to stay involved in sports, as all of this hype surrounding her is based on biological differences between her and the boys that is playing with, that are going to disappear very, very quickly.  I would hate to see some situation where she continues playing with the boys a little too long, and then finally gets the absolute wind knocked out of her, and then she walks away and never plays sports again.","created_utc":1355828867000,"comment_id":"c7ib2jz","parent_id":"t3_150o7u","score":12,"submission_id":"150o7u"}

{"author":"DoctorUnkman","body":"It's just so weird how stigmatized suicide is among men. I can carry on an entire conversation and relate with guys about depression but once the word suicide comes up I clam up and can't seem to say anything. It bothers me so much because I'm going through essentially the same thoughts as them but there seems to be an invisible barrier between us.\n\nAnother example of other people just kinda glossing over it was on a Facebook post a few years ago. A guy I know wrote a paragraph about how tough things have been for him lately, even mentioning how he's constantly thinking of killing himself. But everyone commented on every other part of his paragraph EXCEPT that one line. Almost as if it wasn't there.\n\nA THIRD example is about another guy I work with who's attempted it a few times and wound up in a psych ward for a bit. He has horrible scars down his wrists to prove it. Anyway one time he was having a rough night and after work kept 'joking' about riding his bike into traffic and the couple of ladies that were there too took it as a joke and laughed about it. I was not. I've made these kinds of 'jokes' myself and I know for a fact that there's truth behind what he's saying. So, in usual man fashion, we dance around that word now while never actually saying it.

(\"Do self care!\" \"It's ok to cry!\" \"go to therapy!\") But having had depression and attempted suicide in the past, this support feels phony. \n\nSometimes, friends or even people we are dating can't deliver the mental health support we need -- whether its because of poor communication, stigma towards mental health, or just general shitty personality, opening up to people who aren't ready or capable of receiving our vulnerability feels shitty.  It's one thing to reshare a post on facebook. It's another to be someone's support. \n\nA lot of the best work I've done has been with friends who respect and care about me (only 1 or 2) and with therapists\/doctors that also see me as more than just a pillbox or broken gay boy. But in the end, I also have to remember that I can't expect everyone to receive my vulnerability readily -- that kind of support is rare, and in a sense should be. It's intimate. \n\nAnyway, reading through some of these posts, I see a lot of frustration but not many constructive comments.

I simply asked for studies\/sources to support, and they only kept repeating \"a man made a sexist remark towards me once so he's stopping women from joining\" okay so while I don't condone the sexism, he isn't the face of the STEM field, and that is one person saying it to one person who is still in the field. So how exactly does this help your claim? I brought this up and they constantly were just calling me sexist, putting words in my mouth that I'm \"invalidating their experience\" and acting like children because I challenged their premise, not even once stating I don't agree or saying that it didn't happen.

No response.\n\nI also think it's rather telling that they expected men should be solely responsible for speaking up when men suffer and putting the blame on them alone.

{"author":"38B0DE","body":"I thought it was an English thing because it sounds so drastically ridiculous.\n\nHere's the definition of [rape (vergewaltigen, verb)](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7gRFtpD.jpg) in my German dictionary. \"To use violence to force intercourse\"\n\nBUT in German when you make a noun out of a verb it can be Maskulinum (masculine) or Femininum (feminine) when it refers to a person. For example to dance is \"tanzen\" and so a male dancer is \"T\u00e4nz*er*\" while a female dancer is \"T\u00e4nz*erin*\". You can see the German language in comparison with English is extremely sexist (\/s). They recently had the words in the traffic regulation laws \"gender neutralized\" because the standard plural forms are traditionally since the inception of the language Maskulinum. So when Germans want to say drivers they say Fahrzeugf\u00fchrer and not Fahrzeugf\u00fchrerinnen. The plural involves everyone male or female but because it the same as the Maskulinum it's supposed to be \"non-inclusive\". Literally 99,99% of the people don't have a problem with it, or even notice it at all. But obviously when women hear it it subconsciously indoctrinates patriarchy in their brains so they become slaves to men. But I digress.\n\nHowever [there is not a Femininum noun](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GRF2hPA.jpg) out of the verb rape (Vergewaltiger) in German. It only has a Maskulinum form. \"A male person who rapes someone\". So the existence of the word for female rapist is not officially recognized.\n\nIf anyone is interested it's the \"Wahrig Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch\" 8th edition from 2006. The dictionary does not omit Femininums of all nouns that have them and has them all additionally wirten down.","created_utc":1452114446000,"comment_id":"cynyypp","parent_id":"t3_3zmrla","score":5,"submission_id":"3zmrla"}

{"author":"ChaosOpen","body":"Ever notice women don't seem to define bullying the same way as men do. According to women it's a long and protracted campaign of unending harassment and it tends to be motivated by a variety of factors that men wouldn't normally think about. (being too pretty or being fat) However, I never saw that type of bullying among guys. I was fat in high school and I was certainly not very popular, however nobody really bothered me unless I was being annoying. One of my few friends was also a bit of an outcast and had a cleft pallet, so since he looked weird people tended to avoid him, but they never really messed with him like you hear about when women define bullying. \n\nI have a theory that women and men deal with confrontation very differently, guys are pretty hot and cold, with guys there is a line, you cross that line and he's gonna start swinging. However, after you slug it out it's possible to make up the next day depending on what started the fight. Women seem to have conflicts that last for months, even years, and involve harassment and any manner of devious tactics.","created_utc":1548767909000,"comment_id":"ef8k5c5","parent_id":"t3_akvipg","score":46,"submission_id":"akvipg"}

It also invalidates the reality that when women seek to abuse\/harm men, they not only have other venues available to them that are easier or subtler then brute force but can also outsource that violence to other men. This can take many form, from encouraging other vulnerable\/gullible men to cause harm for her(either believing to be in her defense or in exchange for sex\/approval) to employing legal, judicial and government systems into causing harm in her interest.\n\nIt's also invalidating the reality that most women are, on average, physically weaker(in domestic violence cases, this is something that women control by exclusively dating men considerably bigger than they are) and, on average, far less capable and competent when it comes to violence(very few women actually train to fight or be physically competent), and that, if this wasn't the case, there is literally nothing that indicates that women would be just as violent or aggressive. If not considerably more so given how much they can get away with. \n\nIt also invalidates the reality that most men are typically in a far worst off position in life than women, especially when it comes to social acceptance and romantic\/sexual opportunities, or that there is a far bigger pressure on men, by women, to be assertive, aggressive and earning money.

{"author":"sstidman","body":"The red pill truths in this book really have me wondering if this was possibly written by a guy trying to expose how easy it is to unfairly destroy a man. Here is an example of what I mean...some of the lines sound like they were copied from this sub:\n\n\u201cIt's patriarchal society that defines violence as physi\u00adcal, in terms of beatings and broken bones, but never in terms of allegations and broken lives. Even when studies show that women are just as violent as men when \"violence\" includes things such as verbal abuse, reputation ravaging, and emotional abuse, patriarchal society still cannot perceive women as aggressors. Despite men beingfar more likely than women to be the victims of violent crimes like homicide, men are still perceived as less deserving of protection. Even present-day federal law still requires men, but not women, to register for selective service-the military draft. In other words, with women gaining power in politics, we can send men to die for us in war without ever having to go ourselves! Patriarchy's persistent perception of women as weak is so deeply ingrained in society that it's embedded in law.\nSo, rather than trying to change patriarchy, women have mastered \"societal judo\" by leveraging the prin\u00adciples of patriarchy against men. We're defeating our oppressors by turning the captain's command of \"women and children first\" into \"men last\" while we sink their ship.\u201d","created_utc":1551089475000,"comment_id":"eh7u3it","parent_id":"t3_auak2n","score":34,"submission_id":"auak2n"}

{"author":"EvrythngComesDwn2Poo","body":"I was raped by my wife constantly for my entire marriage. It started when she would use her pussy as a weapon against me. Every argument, every disagreement would end with the threat that I would never be able to touch it again. This, of course, showed her that she had power over me. \n\nIt quickly turned in to her forcing me to have sex. It wasn't violent, no, she would guilt me in to it. She would start a fight, and then berate, insult my man hood, my ability to please her. I felt like I had to do it, she wouldn't stop until o did. I developed performance issues as a result, and that just made it worse. If I didn't get her off she would berate me until I tried again. This was almost every night for a year.\n\nOnce she got pregnant we stopped having sex. This was ok. I almost forgot about the times that I was forced, though at the time I didn't think of it as being forced. She was my wife. It's what I was supposed to do, right? Right???\n\nThen the baby came. After she healed it started again, but this time it was worse. She stopped even putting up a pretense, just commanding me. If I didn't do it she would deny me other things. No sex, no shower, or clean clothes, or food. If I didn't fuck her I couldn't see my son. I started to feel forced.\n\nThen my daughter came.  I started to fight back. She didn't have the power over me. I was taking it back. She wasn't going to force me to do it, or anything anymore.\n\nThis didn't work for her. She didn't become violent, but she did start actively raping me, not just manipulating me. I would go to bed, at this point in separate rooms, only to wake with her on top of me. I would protest, but there was nothing I would really do. This went on for months.\n\nI never took it to the police, because it took me years after the fact to realize that it was actually rape, but I did try to bring It up with my lawyer during my divorce. I was told 2 things:\n\n1.) It's nearly impossible to prove the a wife raped her husband, even if it was ongoing for years. I would need her to admit that that is what she was doing.\n\n2.) No one would believe me even with proof.\n\nThis has, honestly, had a huge negative impact on me sexually. I know get physically uncomfortable when someone, my wife included, is outwardly sexual around me. My sex drive is shut off and I want to run away. \n\nWe have just recently been able to achieve a fairly healthy sexual relationship, but we have had various issues over the past 8 years getting to this point, almost entirely due to the trauma I experienced at the hand of my ex wife. \n\nSorry for the super long post, this was just to high light that yes, it absolutely does happen, and i wouldn't be surprised if it happens a lot. \n\nBut it's really hard for a guy to come forward, because it's a million times harder for a guy to prove that it was rape than it is for a woman, and even that is nearly impossible without actual physical damage. \n\nThat's not even including the phsychogical element to the whole thing. It's hard for a lot of men to even understand that they are being victimized, really. They know it's uncomfortable, it doesn't feel right, but its still very hard to accept that it is actually rape despite that. \n\nThen there is the fact that many still don't accept that it even happens. I've been called a liar, told I was blowing it out of proportion, even made fun of by friends for mentioning it.","created_utc":1500024469000,"comment_id":"dk70nqd","parent_id":"t3_6n1kee","score":13,"submission_id":"6n1kee"}

{"author":"Cheveyo","body":"I've got a theory about feminists, and it sounds crazy.\n\nI'm starting to think that feminists are not capable of perceiving most men. To a feminist, the average man is invisible until something forces the feminist to acknowledge the man's existence. Like if he gets in her way. But then that man only exists for that short period of time, before disappearing again from the feminist's consciousness.\n\nSo when a feminist looks around at society, they are actually incapable of seeing the suffering of men because they cannot see those men. The only men feminists are capable of actually perceiving are the ones whose lives the feminists want. So wealthy, privileged men.\n\nThis means that a feminist is completely serious when they talk about male privilege because the only men that they can perceive are those men at the top \"1%\".\n\n\nThis is why, I think, it often feels like talking to a wall when talking to feminists. It's because their reality is so far from actual reality, that they cannot understand the truth. They literally can't see the men they don't envy.","created_utc":1540653681000,"comment_id":"e8jczfo","parent_id":"t3_9rrbzv","score":248,"submission_id":"9rrbzv"}

Tell them enough times, and they'll believe it.  So unfortunate that a seminar on abuse also includes gaslighting as abuse during a sad presentation highlighting a victim.

It was very low brow and was obviously trying to appeal to the like-minded. Whenever you see a sentence that starts with, \"We all know...\", its followed by a statement everyone knows in an attempt to establish credibility. When he says, \"Feminists are always fighting for equality right?\", its obviously rhetorical. Again, this is an attempt to build credibility in the reader. It forces you answer the question that you know the answer to, which feels rewarding, thus building your own confidence in what you are reading.\n\nThese are very simple persuasive tactics. They rely on peripheral processing instead of the kind that is actually credible, central processing. This article is pretty terrible and should not be taken seriously by anyone.\n\nAlso, stop trying to represent men's rights because that's not what you are doing. All this material does is enforce an outdated dominant mindset; which promotes the exact opposite of equality.

As an agent of the feminist inquisition, I have the sole authority to \"name\" and determine the nature of an affliction.\n\n3.  Illness is the manifestation of Satan in the world, those who are weak willed enough to manifest the Devil's work are morally corrupt and should look for examples of strength and faith in those who suppress the Devil's influence.  Those who fail to do so, are lacking in faith and an insult to those who do.\n\n4.  Do not profess to care for those tormented by the devil.  It is a ruse to aid Satan in his endeavours.  Only the church has the right and authority to care for the sick - all else is idolatry and witchcraft.\n\n5. If the faithless would only submit themselves to God, repent and submit to the authority of the church, the manifestations of the Devil would be purged from the earth, and the world a paradise.\n\n6. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone (the agents of the inquisition, by default, are without sin, are above reproach - and are free to use sticks and stones to purge the body and soul of sin in the name of the church and God).\n\n7. It is a pity that your soul has been so corrupted by the Devil that you cannot see God's light.\n\n8.
