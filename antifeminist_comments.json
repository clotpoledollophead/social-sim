As well as that it harms men as well due to causing body dysphoria and insecurity about their bodies not looking like the men in the videos. Most women I've spoken to do not hate sex workers (with exceptions to women like bonnie blue and lily Phillips who do deplorable things online in order to boost traffic to their OF) but hate the system they work in and the larger effect it has on women as a whole either working in or out of the industry.\nWould be interested to hear your thoughts, preferably respectfully and not fueled by emotion and dejection.","created_utc":1748818679000,"comment_id":"mvfahy8","parent_id":"t1_mum5hpr","score":1,"submission_id":"1kwstu3"}

{"author":"Radiant_Analysis_524","body":"The issue comes with Feminism ideology as majority of young women in America have mindset that there are more superior to men in every way.  Feminism ideology has ruin society in every way possible and damaged the dating market at unprecedented rates. Women should earn the mens respect and try to win them since women take mens last name for marriage. Biologically speaking from beginning of time, women look for survivability  protective, more assertive traits in men. So if women looking for those traits then they need to respect men as leader and male authority.\n\n Most women in America especially black women are not even close adhere to mens directive they love to just argue since they think and make choices based on their emotions. Women need to understand mens job is hard already, they are breadwinner so they need to go out deal in this Bullshit stressful world and they don't want to come home to a nagging wife\/gf. So point being here women need understand that aren't entitled to do whatever they want, men should be them in their place.  \n\nNow a days men aren't vocal because they are afraid that they will be called misogynistic and get banned on social platforms. Let's just say if a average men, who is 5'8 making 50K a year with average personality go out in dating market and ask girl out on date. I bet 100% he will be instantly rejected because women have options and thanks to stupid platforms like OF and other platforms that women have more options than ever before. I'm not blaming women on their choices of picking men however when a women aren't dressing modestly, showing too much on social media platforms then at the end day men won't take them serious , they will date to smash only and leave them in limbo. Women live in this fantasy world and easy mode they think , one day that a prince charming will come and rescue her. Her prince charming will make 100-400K a year , 6'0 or above in height , loyal , single , very good looking etc. Based on statistics that's like maybe 5% of population in this country. Rest of those men are married who fit in that requirement. Most of these men on higher status who are millionaire will most likely smash other women because most of women who think they are can marry higher status men they will never able to keep them in first place. Higher status men don't want them around after few months because they are just average women and have high body count. \n\nAll those men who are average they make up 50-60% of population. So I encourage all women to keep their men and give them opportunity if they ask you women on date. \n\nAt the end of the day women should ask men on date rather than other way around. I know it sounds crazy but men are leaders and they should be respected. So if there are leaders somone who follow their lead women should humble themselves , be respectful,  have open ended communication. If women think rationally , understand male authority, America would be respected by other countries, our economy would be better shape, we would have more nuclear families,  less divorce rates, lower crime rates , no 3rd sex would exist etc. I'm glad you left feminism and you should encourage this in your circle.","created_utc":1752105170000,"comment_id":"n271urd","parent_id":"t3_1lvhd7r","score":11,"submission_id":"1lvhd7r"}

And I\u2019m not saying otherwise. And neither am I saying that women have it easy. I understand that women have genuine struggles and concerns of their own. What I am saying though is that what you just described doesn\u2019t change the fact that men have a rampant mental health crisis for a very long time because it was unaddressed. Yes, men were prioritized, but this doesn\u2019t change the fact that men have high suicide rates. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that media plays female on male sexual assault for laughs.

Religious dating apps may be of good use. \n\nThe 50\/50 guys you\u2019re coming across in church are probably progressive religionists.

{"author":"Duckady","body":"Well if you\u2019d take the time to research some information on the topic I\u2019d be happy to enlighten some misconceptions.\n\nThe gender pay gap is the average difference between the wages or salaries of men and women who are working. It is often measured by comparing the median earnings of full-time workers of each gender, but it can also be calculated using other methods. The gender pay gap is not fake because it is based on reliable data from official sources, such as Statistics Canada, and it reflects the economic and social inequalities that women face in the labour market.\n\nSome of the factors that contribute to the gender pay gap are:\n\n- Occupational segregation: Women and men tend to work in different types of jobs, and the jobs that are dominated by women tend to be lower-paid and lower-valued than the jobs that are dominated by men.\n\n- Educational attainment: Women and men have different levels of education and training, and the fields of study that women choose tend to have lower returns in the labour market than the fields of study that men choose.\n\n- Unpaid work: Women spend more time than men on unpaid work, such as household chores and caregiving, which reduces their availability and flexibility for paid work and limits their career opportunities and advancement.\n\n- Discrimination: Women face direct and indirect discrimination in the labour market, such as being paid less than men for the same work, being denied promotions or training, or being harassed or stereotyped because of their gender.\n\nGender wage gap | Definition & Facts | Britannica Money. https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/money\/topic\/gender-wage-gap.\n\nThe Gender Pay Gap | Pay Gap in Canada | The Facts - Canadian Women's .... https:\/\/canadianwomen.org\/the-facts\/the-gender-pay-gap\/.\n\nGender pay gap - Wikipedia. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gender_pay_gap.\n\nGENDER PAY GAP | English meaning - Cambridge Dictionary. https:\/\/dictionary.cambridge.org\/dictionary\/english\/gender-pay-gap.\n\nGender wage gap | Definition & Facts | Britannica Money. https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/money\/topic\/gender-wage-gap.\n\nThe Gender Pay Gap | Pay Gap in Canada | The Facts - Canadian Women's .... https:\/\/canadianwomen.org\/the-facts\/the-gender-pay-gap\/.\n\nGender pay gap - Wikipedia. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gender_pay_gap.\n\nGENDER PAY GAP | English meaning - Cambridge Dictionary. https:\/\/dictionary.cambridge.org\/dictionary\/english\/gender-pay-gap.\n\nGENDER PAY GAP definition | Cambridge English Dictionary. https:\/\/dictionary.cambridge.org\/us\/dictionary\/english\/gender-pay-gap.","created_utc":1704814210000,"comment_id":"kh0u5x6","parent_id":"t1_kh0mn9m","score":1,"submission_id":"fz7e61"}

Since you're talking about \"double pass\", I think you're using software encoding.\n\nI don't have experience with Nvidia GPU encoding but I DO know you're doing it wrong:\n\n* **DON'T** disable B-Frames and lookahead! They're one of the most efficient compression methods and they give you higher quality for the same bitrate. \"More compression\" means lower file sizes which means you can get **HIGHER** quality for the same bitrate.\n  - Instead, you should increase B-Frames as much as possible, except on live streams which you should use 1 B-Frames or disable it entirely to reduce latency.\n  - \"ridiculous processing power\" doesn't matter if you're using a GPU. The GPU has a dedicated video encoding hardware that's separate from the 3D rendering engine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Use a GOP size\/key frame interval of `fps*10` or `fps*5` if you're recording and `fps*3` with a cap of 300 if you're streaming. This affects the quality and file size a lot\n  - For example, if you're recording 4K60, `fps*10 = 60*10 = 600` key frame interval\/GOP size.\n  - 4K60 streaming GOP size = `60*10 = 600` but you should only use `300` at max","created_utc":1746064394000,"comment_id":"mpvmpi2","parent_id":"t1_mpubvib","score":1,"submission_id":"1k9kndr"}

{"author":"AJ_The_Best_7","body":"Hello OP (and my fellow anti-feminists of course!). I am going to breakdown parts of this post for us all so OP can understand us a little better, so we can ask OP a few questions, and for OP to gain a better understanding of why feminism is failing us.\n\n**\"I am a feminist and it breaks my heart that forums like this exists.\"**  \nI am curious OP as to why that is? Since the dawn of civilisation humans have had conflicting opinions. That's like a liberal being upset at a conservative forum.\n\n**\"When I say I am a feminist I mean giving women choice, choice to be a housewife and have lots of children or to be childless and become CEO of a motor company\"**  \nThe fact that you have to specify shows that the modern, western feminist movement is all over the place with contradictions left, right and centre. The fact that you have to specify that you agree with both the traditional and nontraditional female lifestyle shows that deep down you know that a lot of feminists don't showing that the movement is failing at what it set out to do and is branching away from its core principles.\n\n**\"Feminism isn\u2019t about eradicating femininity, at least it shouldn\u2019t be.\"**  \nThe fact that you specify that it shouldn't be means that you know that feminism is erasing femininity. You preach about what you wish feminism was rather than what feminism is.\n\n**\"Motherhood is not brainwashing\"**  \nWhy would we assume that motherhood is brainwashing? Unless...that is what feminism is preaching at the moment? Just something to think about.\n\n**\"Selling your daughter to the highest bidder is not part of culture\"**  \nMy other problems with your speech was a matter of opinion. This one is a matter of fact because marrying your children for the best benefits (or \"to the highest bidder\" in your own words) is something humankind have been doing for centuries. Until the 20th and 21st century marriage was an economic proposition and not many married for love, your great grandparents probably had an arranged marriage, if not then your great great grandparents probably did. Our society and families were built on this foundation.  \n  \n**\"Look to the women, I see your rage you\u2019re confused\"**  \n We are not the confused ones here, you are. Do not come into a forum of over one thousand men and women and tell us that we are all confused because we have escaped the brainwashing of mass media and Hollywood and see feminism for the flawed ideology it really is. Feminism has broken our society and it will take us decades to find our way back to common sense.  \n\n**-----------------------------------------**\n\n**My conclusion:**  \nYour perception of feminism is deeply skewed, it is fantastical rather than realistic. Feminism has failed us as a society and I would love to discuss it with you and any of your feminist friends if you are up for it.","created_utc":1752107506000,"comment_id":"n27acfu","parent_id":"t3_1lup9db","score":9,"submission_id":"1lup9db"}
