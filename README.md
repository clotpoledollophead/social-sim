# Understanding Gendered Dynamics in Online Discourse <br> <sub>A Social Simulation Framework Using LLMs and Predictive Models</sub>
This project combines large language models and lightweight predictive models to simulate and analyze voting behavior and biases in gender-related discourse found on the social platform, Reddit. Our goal is to model and predict how users upvote/downvote to content under different social and cognitive contexts, and to understand emergent patterns of bias.

## Research Goals
1. Model the **cognitive and social mechanisms** driving online voting behavior
2. Produce a novel, reproducible framework of LLM-based social simulations

## Fine-tuning A Lightweight Model
1. Predict upvote/downvotes
