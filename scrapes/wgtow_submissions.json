It's suffocating because there's no freedom to do anything, you're never really an individual but a woman trapped in the web of complex societal expectations: wear this, do this, marry him, have kids and you execute all these commands because there really aren't many other options for you. You're a lady in reduced circumstances, so, you make the best of them and concede for your survival.\n\nBut women in the west, they have options. Or at least that's what we like to think. They're not trapped in the same sense - they can own property, have careers and be someone. But even these women are a victim of ''mind forged manacles'' - their bodies are free however, their minds are shackled. They're convinced that empowerment comes through 'attracting' the male gaze - being the cool kink loving girl, the girlfriend who pays for everything and dates men old enough to be her father. \n\nBeing a gen z, it's kind of horrifying seeing the path my generation is going down, how are you expected to sustain healthy relationship with men who actively consume ''school girl'' ''barely legal'' and other degrading porn? instead of standing up against this, women like always concede and accept their reduced circumstances. Younger and Younger girls are lured into sex work to appeal to the male gaze while older women slowly fade into nothingness or pay thousands of dollars to hold onto their youth because they're aging but the girls in their husband's porn stash never do. So are we really free, even in the West?\n\nWe're not free because our minds are tied down. We glamourize our oppression and embrace it with full arms: spending our hard earned money on procedures to make us look beautiful, wearing make up for men and shaving for men (as for the ladies, who like to argue that they do make-up or shave for themselves, I seriously find it hard to believe this because unless, your make up and shavers are laced with MDMA, I don't see what there is to enjoy about all these laborious rituals - men complain when they have to shave their balls but women find it very enjoyable to pluck every single hair off their body -- strange). Also, the repercussions for not conforming to all these expectations are severe - unattractive women are alienated and shunned into conforming to these rituals for their own survival. So, would we ever be free? not in this life time -- you see patriarchy is build upon pillars of male solidarity, men protect each other and stick up for each other while collectively looking down on women, they love their masculine power meanwhile, there is no such thing as female solidarity, it is merely an illusion, women constantly compete and put down each other in order to get 'picked' and rewarded by men. Younger women readily replace older women without ever thinking that one day they will be consumed and turn old too.\n\nSo, Ladies, which dystopia is better?","title":"I grew up in a conservative muslim society and expected to find liberation in the West.

One of the main reasons why women seek out men is that they hope these men to protect them from other men.

Or at least the only ones where people are in a similar place and there are bad sides, like with any other decision you make. \n\nI was visiting my grandmother over Christmas and she had a neighbor. He was never married, has no children, probably gay and in a very rural and catholic place so he never had a partner. He\u2019s 88 years old and really struggling. He constantly trips, almost can\u2019t walk anymore and of course lives alone. Since he has no children, no one helps him with his chores. He\u2019s not wealthy enough to pay for help and of course doesn\u2019t want to go to a nursery home. I mean many young people just say \u201ewell then I will go to the nursery home\u201c, but if we\u2019re being honest, it must be incredible hurtful to do so for many people. This said man worked very hard to buy his home and spend almost all his life there and especially older people can\u2019t get used to new places anymore the way younger do so he clings to his home as much as possible. He has a nephew that drives him to a doctor if needed, but that\u2019s it. \nHe walks everyday through the village, visiting one person today, the next tomorrow and almost all people are so fed up with him, because they feel like he overstayed his welcome a long time ago. They have their own problems and especially their own families. They don\u2019t need his company more than like for a small chat when meeting while grocery shopping or a visit once a few months. For him on the other hand they\u2019re the only social and closest contacts he has. \nAnd I couldn\u2019t stop thinking that this will be my future too. Just even without the nephew, because I\u2019m an only child. \nI mean I\u2019m childfree much longer than men free, since I\u2019ve realized in my early teens that having a child means you have to be a parent and it isn\u2019t just a small play mate and I\u2019m now 31 and never wanted to have any. I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle anything of it starting with pregnancy. So this isn\u2019t an option at all and never was. \nI also prefer loneliness to the abuse I had to endure from men. It\u2019s better to be lonely than suffering in my own home where I should feel the safest. I don\u2019t regret  my choice going men free and I\u2019m not unsure about it. \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t help and feel an incredible loneliness simply  for not being able to talk  about my worries with anyone. My family and friends would try to convince me to look for a \u201egood man\u201c and here in all the subs every time I just mentioned my worries they were downplayed, I was downvoted to oblivion or people even tried to question my integrity regarding my choice. So there\u2019s no person and no place to go to talk about it. But subs like this should be a place. To be completely honest and I think that some might relate: going men free for me isn\u2019t finding my personal paradise where everything is pink and glittery with singing unicorns. Going through life without a lifetime companion isn\u2019t my dream life and never was. Being a social creature is deep in human\u2019s nature. It\u2019s just choosing the lesser evil, because the alternative means constant suffering. So please, let also allow us to talk about the dark sides of it too. \n\n (Btw tried to share it in 4B first, but of course it wasn\u2019t approved by the mods.

Because of this, we are less likely to physically fight back specially if our oppressors are our own fathers, brothers, sons, friends, and families. We are socially and emotionally linked to our oppressors and millenia of brainwashing has stopped us from fighting them.

Queue being 20 years old and 3\/4 of my friend group getting nose jobs, preventative Botox, and fillers.\n\nWhen I was 18, I worked for her dad (the surgeon) and my dad suggested I get a boob job. \u201cThink of the doors it will open!\u201d I asked for a consultation but ultimately backed out because having a childhood friend dad see my boobs made me want to vomit.\n\nThank god I did. That would set the stage for my experience and confusion when it came to my looks. \n\nWhen I turned 30 (last april) my friends told me I should treat myself to Botox and filler. I have a faint brow furrow, but honestly, I\u2019m constantly mistaken for being in my younger 20s.\n\nThese are my very first signs of aging. Am I really going to start fighting this now? That means I will be fighting it for the rest of my life. And for who? \n\nI sort of bought into \u201cpretty privilege\u201d and the boss b*** aesthetic for a while\u2014despite it being completely against my personality. \u201cWhatever I need to do for power,\u201d I told myself.\n\nLast week, I watched a YouTube video where a woman takes down the Asian school girl stereotype. She talked about how the girls portrayed are ultimately written by men. And so women are lied to and told that as a young girl they can hold power by seducing older men, being sexually free, and wielding sex as power. But she pointed out that in reality, a high schooler having sex with an older man is always a case of a predator and prey.\n\nDespite knowing this on some level, her pointing it out blew my mind. Because I had 100% bought into these tropes as a high schooler, and I also 100% became preyed upon\u2014but I never connected the dots that this was a well laid path dictated to me by media since I was a child.\n\nAnd so, what is \u201cpretty privilege\u201d? This other intangible source of power women somehow have access to? I know the terms comes from femcel language, but they merely labeled something Society constantly tells us is real. I knew it didn\u2019t exist, because I was conventionally attractive yet hated myself and wanted to disappear from the male gaze. Yet, I was being fed this trope that to be a successful career women\u2014I must be something I\u2019m not. That overemphasizing my looks, adjusting my body, wearing makeup that I hate, clothes that are not my style\u2014that somehow this would give me a competitive edge. But does it really? When I was younger and wore nice clothes (because we had to) and makeup to the office, all I got was harassment.\n\nThe final straw was hearing about the toxins found in makeup. Surely injecting botulism has SOME sort of long standing effect. And what kind of \u201cprivilege\u201d do I really have if I have to inject botulism in my face to be taken seriously?\n\nI\u2019ve had the appointment for a month, and I called today to cancel. I threw a thousand bucks in my IRA instead. Wealth is a power I can respect, having some intangible advantage of the male gaze by injecting fillers and toxins into my face are not. \n\nI feel extremely relieved, happy, and at peace not falling for the fiction society tells me will give me material power.","title":"Just canceled an appointment for Botox and fillers and feel SO RELIEVED","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/o26irj\/just_canceled_an_appointment_for_botox_and\/"}

And I'm not saying a woman should not have sex, I do want women to enjoy sex but please realize a sex toy is usually more trust worthy and the fantasies you can have are endlessly more worth it than the security risks with a guy who really just wants to use and\/or control you.\n\nWhen I was in East Asia an older guy told me that past a certain age (over 30) the women in his country expect marriage so the guys often compensate them, either by money or gifts or expensive trips. Notice he was not talking about men that much older, just in their 40s or early 50s (but older of course too).\n\nIn East Asia marriage\/honest commitment is expected(!) and it suddenly made soooo much sense why you see young western\/white guys getting \"wives\" in East Asia (usually Japan or China) while going to Southeast Asia for \"fun\". They usually compensate it there too but it costs less.\n\nI really hope women wake up and stop giving sex away for free unless they are married to a man that is fully committed to them, that they even have children with or where they don't mind much if they become pregnant because they KNOW he will be at their side.\nI know this is currently mostly a fairy tale. But think about it, is there any men giving out free checks to women \"just because they are nice\"? No I see them taking advantage of single moms and other desperate women (with tiny dinner invitations maybe if at all) so they can use them for sex. So why should women give out \"sex checks\" for free? You know we are better at pleasing ourselves! Way better.

You lift your arms in the air, stand up, look at the top. Studies  have shown the positive effects of this pose and the self esteem and performance in tests. (Next time you have a job interview, try it for a few minutes, it really helps). \n\nWhen I was 18 I really wanted to be more self confident, so I started reading articles and started reading books. There are two common themes:\n\n1) The things you tell yourself, even if you don't believe them, shape the way you think of yourself and how you act. If you are telling yourself \"I am so stupid.\" if you did something wrong, it will effect your self esteem in the long run. When I was trying to gain self confident, I told myself \"I am worthy of love. I am smart, I am a hustler etc\" everyday in front of the mirror. I would stop making negative comments about myself infront of others and in my thaughts. \n\nIt was hard and it was a long process. At first I wanted to cry, because I felt so ridicoules. I didnt believe the things I said. But after month of hard training and going out of my comfort zone, I gained confidence. Ohhh and it changed my life! I got my own apartment, moved to a new city, got a job. All by myself. Suddenly I could see my worth. The things I was telling myself were ingrained in my brain. Your brain is changing all your life.\n\n2) How you carry yourself is important and is effecting your confidence and your actions. Do you sit straight? Do you look at your feet while walking? Do you hide behind people at a new event? \n\nIt was hard to change these patterns and I had a really difficult time adjusting. But it paid off, I started talking more, didnt feel so self continous about my body and about myself as a person. \n\nGaining confidence was the best decision I ever made. \n\nAnd now think about mainstream porn:\n\n- The women are called \"Sluts, whores\" and other racial slurs.\n\n- The women are choked in 80 % of the time (I am not speaking of BDSM porn)\n\n- The men use violent phrases like \"I now you want it\" in a violent voice \n\n- The women have to call themself degrading things\n\n-Even when there is no degrading stuff in the video, the title of the video degrades the woman.\n\n- \"Getting fucked\" is an insult. So every woman who is talking about \"wanting to getting fucked\" is insulting herself\n\n\nThere are many more examples, but the main theme is shock value. But they never try to degrate the men (suspecious). \n\nIf you masturbate with this thaughts in your mind, if you imagine yourself getting fucked by a man who hates you, who is degrading you, calling you slurs etc. then you will believe it someday and act accordingly. \n\nStop. Watching. Porn. \n\nYour brain is chaning. \n\nYou are not a slut, a whore. You never were meant to be called these names. You are a human beeing. Penisses are the weakest part of the male body, if you kick it, he wont be able to move lol. \n\nPorn is designed to make men feel powerful and to make women feel weak.","title":"Heterosexual Sex (the way men like it) is bad for womens self esteem and I want to explain why.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/jlfhpt\/heterosexual_sex_the_way_men_like_it_is_bad_for\/"}

I brought up one to my mother when I was a child and she never took it seriously, so I never brought up the second incident.\n\nI never was in a great relationship with men, and I bounced from guy to guy and it was always something... they either watched too much porn, cheated, solicited escorts, controlling, physically abusive, or all of the above.\n\nI don\u2019t EVER want any man around my child and most definitely would never want them alone with her simply because I want to date or have a partner.

Like it was only meant for my boyfriend to use sexually. Even when I wasn't in a relationship, there were constant messages telling me that I had to keep my body in perfect condition not for myself, but so that a potential man will be attracted to it and find it sexually appealing. \n\nThe educational books I read as a child all focused on explaining how, for example the vagina and uterus were for sex and reproduction. Which is important in its own way, of course, but there was no mention of them serving any other purpose.\n\nAs far as existing in our society goes, I could deal with shaving legs and pits, but what I struggled with immensely (to the point of developing severe body dysmorphia) were my breasts, butt, and especially genitals. I resented them, I hated them, and even found them repulsive because they reminded me at all times that they weren't truly mine, that they weren't there for me, but only for male consumption. They were these separate parts, objects even, meant for male sexual enjoyment. \n\nI absolutely didn't want that, so I didn't want to live with them and completely dissociated from them. I can see why some women want to get rid of them completely, these days especially. They felt like attachments, weighing me down. Every time I looked at my naked body in the mirror, I was reminded of my sexual potential, of men, and of porn, something I was exposed to at a very young age. \n\nI was doing it subconsciously a lot of the time, and constantly thinking and worrying if they were the right shape and size and texture everything else I can't even think of right now. And it wasn't just those parts - I also struggled with my curves, because even the way my hips were shaped was seen as sexy, something that men love. \n\nBut then when I stopped dating and took myself \"off the market\" (ugh, I despise that term because it makes me feel like cattle, but will use it here to make a point), my perception slowly started changing. I'm still not completely where I want to be, but the other day I looked at myself in the mirror and something was different. I didn't see a sexualized body. I didn't see the aforementioned parts as separate and pornified. I've finally started to be able to reclaim them as my own. I've started living for myself and realised I WAS my body - the entirety of it. It's all completely mine, and I absolutely don't have to share it. I don't have to let someone use it in a way I don't want him to. The parts stopped existing to attract and to fit into some societal standards. Yes, breasts and butts and genitals can have a sexual function, but they're not the only function, not even the primary one in fact, and I have a choice to see and use them as completely non-sexual. They can be a neutral part of my female body. \n\nIt's taken me years to come to this stage because the brainwashing was so deeply ingrained. It was extreme in my case - I wasn't even able to do yoga poses because they reminded me of sexual positions with my butt sticking out and legs apart. I'm so glad I'm able to exercise more comfortably now.\n\nHas anyone else noticed a better relationship with her body after going wgtow?","title":"Improved body image after going my own way","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/1798sh5\/improved_body_image_after_going_my_own_way\/"}

You can get a job, an income to support yourself. Have money. Own a house. Land. While that will give you a great amount of independence, surface level accomplishments can't truly compensate for the more deeper, fundamental level of powerlessness that comes with  living life as a woman, and I'll explain why. \n\nYou're in for a lifetime of being patronized, treated like you're stupid and ignorant, being told what to do, how to walk, talk, chew, dress, behave, not being taken seriously in a professional, but especially in a medical context. If you dare stand out, even a little, by being outspoken, refusing to perform the role that has been given to you at birth, there's a society that will axe you back into place like a stick that stands out from the bundle. \n\nDespite being \"civilized\", we're all pretty much still animals, highly intelligent ones at that, but still animals, and due to this, we're highly influenced by our biology. The struggle for resources, the fight for territory, mates etc. This is where sheer physical size comes to play.\n\n\nAs children, we all look up to adults and see them as all powerful and long to be just like them when we grow up. \nBut when you're a woman, when the puberty is over and you're finally an adult you never get to be on an equal footing with other adult men; you realize that your dreams never came true: you're significantly shorter and smaller than almost all males. You see even teenage boys who are towering over you. You see teen boys breaking adult female athletes' records in sports. \n\nYou realize that you could be easily beaten and raped by almost every adult men. Men also realize this too, so they don't miss the chance to remind you of this on a daily basis and assert their dominance purely because they can - whether it's catcalling, being creepy, being rude to you overall etc the list is endless. \n\nSo there's always two underlying fears that you have: of being physically beaten and being raped(and consequently,  impregnted). Personally I think that there's no woman that hasn't been at the receiving end of men's intimidation during her lifetime. Men are too, but there isn't that large societal and physical gap in power between two men. \n\nThe second is, as I said, the fear of being raped. You see it all the time on the news. You may know someone that's been raped. And you surely have been reminded that you, too, could be one of these women - by their more or less subtle sexual intimidation. \n\nYou start to take precautions. You police yourself - what routes you take, when, where, what you wear, shoes you wear and how fast you could run or kick in them. Being too friendly can get you into a big trouble. So can being unfriendly. \n\nYou waste time, money and energy calculating, equipping yourself, worrying about how you're going to purely avoid or defend yourself from men - all these resources that men don't have to waste on that, therefore leaving them more space to dedicate themselves to other things that actually make you thrive in life, not barely survive. Think about how many things you have either done, or been prevented to do, how much money you've spent on taxi or gas instead of walking just to get to work without being in danger, for example.\n\nSo you start to train. You train, a lot. You may even buy protein, supplements, healthy food and so on. Then you see some fatass whose only exercise is sitting in front of the TV after work eating doritos, and he's still stronger than you. You see average dudes lifting more than professional female athletes. Now this is where steroids come into play, but even then you'll probably only be as strong as an average male. Maybe. Imagine the sheer dedication just so you be like the average male. Not trained one, not strong one, just average dorito eating Joe. That's just... demoralizing.\n\nNext thing, you try and get some weapons. They're like a clutch you need because you've been born in a physically weak body. They could be anything, depending on legality and availability. Then you realize that these weapons may not even help you, and that without them you're f***d anyway. \n\n\nSpeaking of f*****g, that's another topic I want to touch on. \nFreud long ago wrote on a theory called \"penis envy\", and it has been a controversial topic ever since. When you look at it from a practical and literal standpoint, it really does make no sense. Why would anyone want a nuisance that dangles between their legs 24\/7, has to be adjusted, and is extremely vulnerable to even a slightest tap, exposed and can be easily torn off so your chances of reproduction are zero? \n\nBut our subconscious doesn't work on purely practical principles. \n\nFirst of all, sex is physically dominating a person, and you see that even among animals where the higher ranked, stronger male will mount the weaker male. You see this pattern in humans, too. The one doing the f*****g is never as looked down upon as the one on the receiving end. The \"prison b***h\" in prisons is always on the receiving end, meanwhile the doer isn't even considered 'gay'. \nBeing f****d is considered the most debasing thing that can happen to someone. And as we see, it's debasing even though it's consensual. Just take a look at our language - \"f*** you\", \"suck a d***\", \"we are f****d\"... and it's like that in most languages in the world. \n\nAnd apart from it being physically overpowering, there's the most important component - being able to impregnate someone. That means turning their life into a nightmare, ruining their body, physical and mental health, completely derailing the course of their life and possibly ending their life - all of that with just ejaculating into someone. \n\nThere's a reason why anti-choicers are so adamant not only against abortion, but also against temporary birth control, let alone permanent sterilization. In fact, sterilization is heavily restricted even in a lot of first world countries. And this is the best in the world that we have it right now. \n\nAnd in the end, there's a fear of losing of these little \"privileges\" that we have. A country can turn into a fascist hellhole overnight, just like it did in Iran in 1979. \n\nThis isn't to discourage anyone, in fact I think everyone should fight against the nature as we did for millennia. \nTake whatever measures we can to make life easier.  We shouldn't let nature dictate our entire lives, and if it means utilizing science to change, or at least minimize what nature has \"gifted\" us with, we should use it to the maximum.\n\nEdit: lmfao this got removed from r\/TwoXChromosomes for some reason \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit2: They re-approved it.","title":"I feel like as a woman, you never get to truly experience the feeling of power that comes with being an adult.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/iumvwy\/i_feel_like_as_a_woman_you_never_get_to_truly\/"}

She ended up telling me that all the years they've been together my grandfather treated her awfully, was excessively controlling, negging, mean, etc. It hit me hard because my grandfather was always so good and loving to my cousins and I our whole lives.\n\nBut now its hitting how my grandma suffered in silence for all these years and its making sense why she behaved certain ways - leaving the house to be away from him, hiding out downstairs to call her friends so he wouldn't hear her and yell at her, also the fact that they never have slept in the same room. They always had separate bedrooms and beds. Oddly enough, I thought it was normal for married couples.\n\nWhen my grandfather started to become ill she essentially did everything she could to help him - to the point where her drs begged her to put him in a nursing home. She ended up having a heart attack and the drs said it was caused by the stress of taking care of him. It was like she aged 10 years in the span of 3 months. And now he's been away for 1 month shes like a new happy and healthy woman. \n\nI'm in my mid 20s now and no one in my family has happy marriages. Now that I've seen several former classmates and friends get engaged and married, I have seen how quickly the woman becomes trapped and miserable. My friend wants me to come to her wedding, but I can't bring myself to after always hearing how poorly her fiance treats her. He doesn't contribute and shes so stressed many ends meet for him. He badmouths her friends and doesn't let them hang. Recently, he threw a fit that she put a Christmas decoration in the yard (that she got as a gift). Then he dictated the decorations of the house and made her buy it all. She's miserable and workouts to cope but she cries in her car a few times a week. yet she's so proud of her ring and brags about her approaching wedding. How can these women love what hurts them? Why do they think love should be this awful and painful? \n\nI am so tired of seeing women bragging about their rings or talking about their marriage like its this huge accomplishment. I am also tired of getting looked at funny and shamed by other women for not being engaged or married. Anyone can get married. \n\nI've lived in fear when dating of being cheated on. I got over that. But then I started being fearful of being with someone and everything being great and then one day they just completely change and start treating you poorly. I've seen it happen arounf me and I'm seeing a lot of posts online about it too. Usually, it happens a little bit after the couple is married and the \"honeymoon phase\" wears off. Why is that even a term? It is literally telling you expect to get annoyed at each other and feel like a \"ball and chain\". It's awful. I had a lot of lovely female roomates and friends in college lived with the same group for 2 whole years. We didn't get sick of each other, switch up, or start treating each other lousily. \n\nI hungout with my grandpa and did a lot more when he started getting sick. He held my hand and told me how he was suffering. We both ugly sobbed. He told me \"i just wish I could live to see you get married. I want you to get married.\" He was proud of me for everything else. I told him I can't make that promise and ive tried dating lots of times in the past but the guys cheated or treated me so lousy (mcdonalds or walmart first dates smh) that I stopped dating and refuse to be miserable and held down. He begged me and said I have to settle down at some point. then there's my grandma begging me dont settle and how she regrets a lot but now its too late for her. \n\nTo top it off I learned the man that was flirting with me in my apartment parking lot when I moved in and would always be checking me out and hitting on me ... hes been married the whole time. Recently, a woman outside scoffed at my car as im walking to it and goes \"oh thats YOUR car, my husband told me all about you\" I had never even seen this woman before. And I described him and his car and shes like \"yeah thats mY hUsBaNd\" copped an attitude at me when he's the problem since he's flirting with me and honestly would cheat the second I gave him the chance. Now shes accusing me of stealing her mail and using another neighbor to \"tell me\". I am so disgusted a married man thinks its okay to keep hitting on me and even more disgusted shes instigating I'm a problem when the real issue is her husband. \n\nIt really hurts learning the truth about my grandpa in the midst of him further declining in health and i am trying to cope with the fact he may die before they lift the visitor ban. I said by Christmas i will see how I feel really about dating and whatnot and look how the truth about him came out so close to the holiday. Its like the nail in the coffin for me. And the other nail is this guy thats married and his awful wife giving me an attitude and starting to lie\/gossip about me.  Marriage really feels like a sham for women, all the guys seem to completely change after it if they aren't awful already, I'm tired of being told to accept this bs that love hurts. I don't want anyone holding me back. I am done. Marriage always seems to go up in flames whether or not the couple admits it. I want to be happy for others but how can I sit and smile for them when all I see is the marriages ive described? How can I be happy for my friends and family when I see they lie to themselves and are getting so hurt?

I was talking to a 17 year old girl at my work, and the way she is talking about her life in school is just worlds apart from how I remember it. She was talking openly about her gay and trans friends like it wasn't a big deal at all which made me happy and hopeful. And then she said that she just didn't want to date, that she just liked being single. This was a huge thing to me, I know she is only 17, but when I was at that age I simply did not even know this was a real option kind of and was an okay thing to do. I felt like I had to be with men and give them what they wanted. I wish I had been so wise at that age, and avoided all the trauma and multiple actual near death experiences that the dating thing gave me. I personally know of multiple women around my age in my life that simply have chosen to opt out and stay single now. But this is all though a result of them all experiencing something awful, SA, rape, abuse or something soul crushing like that. I also had to go this route after learning the hard way that it was best for me, I wish I had known it in the beginning and not been so naive. I am an autistic woman in a neurotypical world, so I draw in the absolute worst of abusers towards me. Being unworldly and prone to manipulation and gaslighting I guess. We autistic people grow up being constantly told that \"we\" are wrong somehow and when we feel uncomfortable or are in pain, that something is wrong with us and we need to endure it to stay normal. That the problem is always with us and our fault. We also tend to get bullied into oblivion for being different. Of course we grow up to be perfect targets. But I am wondering, how common is this were you are, that women are opting out like this? Are they aware of what they are doing, or just choosing silently to stay single?

For the lurkers. This is for you.\n\nIt is so important to do things for yourself. By that, I mean, doing what YOU want, and that is not influenced by your parents or significant other.\n\nI don't really mean the battles so much as I mean the wars. Sometimes, you do have to do things that other people want you to do - that's just life. You can't have it your way ALL the time. But the big decisions - decisions that deeply impact your life? You have to do what's best for you.\n\nA long (long, long) time ago, when I was a junior in high school, college visits and applications were coming up. I had a very clear sense of what I wanted to do, what I wanted to be. But I couldn't bear to be separated from my boyfriend at the time. So what did I do? Only applied to the colleges he applied to. Visited the colleges he visited. I applied to a few of mine own (and got in), but decided not to go there because it's not where he was going.\n\nDon't DO THAT. Do NOT even consider anyone else when making these big choices. GO. YOUR. OWN. WAY. With big choices like these, you absolutely need to put blinders on - put yourself in a vacuum. Imagine you have no friends or family or limitations and make choices based on pure HEART. Don't apply to UCLA if you hate the West Coast just because your significant other is. Do not follow them. It's not worth it!\n\nAnd this applies to everything. Jobs, colleges, any big choices. Do what's right for YOU.","title":"Choose Yourself.

Married women die earlier, perform vastly more unpaid domestic labour and report much lower levels of happiness. And yet the cultural myth persists that marriage is essential to women\u2019s well being, and that failure to secure it renders our lives a disappointing imitation.\n\nFrom its origins as a form of property transaction and tool of diplomacy to the ongoing harm experienced by women physically, emotionally and economically, marriage is one of patriarchy\u2019s most covert weapons of oppression to ensure women live a life in service to men and male power.\n\n\u201cI Don\u2019t\u201d will not just be an outlining of marriage and the rude shock it delivers to women raised on a diet of romantic comedies and Disney - it will be a call to arms to actively reject marriage and the subjugation it co-opts women into thinking will be our salvation.\n\nMore than anything, it\u2019s a love story.\n\nOut October 2023. \"\n\nClementine Ford [https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/clementine\\_ford\/](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/clementine_ford\/)\n\n\ud83d\udda4","title":"\u201cI Don\u2019t: An Explosive and Inarguable Case Against Marriage\u201d by Clementine Ford coming October 2023","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/xm3qhw\/i_dont_an_explosive_and_inarguable_case_against\/"}

I get it.\n\nI've dated a lot of men, I've had a lot of male friends,  and of course have male relatives... all of whom I'm fucking tired of.\n\nNow I'm not joking when I say I've dated a lot of men. I thought that I needed a life partner so for the last six years I've been trying to find him. But all of the men I've met are at best inadequate and more often than not, awful.\n\nI've been let down time and time again by men. They've hit me, assaulted me, lied to me, manipulated me and abandoned me. But for some reason I forgave them or gave them a second (more like 57th) chance and continued to pursue them romantically or just grinned and beared it because we're related. \n\nWhy? You ladies have me questioning myself. What have men ever done for me? What positive impact have they had on my life? \nNothing substantial. Nothing at all.\n\nI don't like men in general, they're loud and violent and assume they're more intelligent than every woman they meet regardless of their often subpar IQ. They take pleasure from degrading women, and exerting their control over them and causing them pain.\n\nI have met so many different women, amazing women, to whom no man I've ever met could even compare. \n\nFor the last six months or so I've done something similar to WGTOW, before I even knew what it was.\n I wanted to finish my degree without distraction so I stopped dating and avoided men in general and you want to know something? \n\nI feel amazing.

We are still constantly exposed to it. Thanks to the internet I finally found women who admit the reality of hetero relationships. Before this, I used to relapse into fantasyland.\n\nI used to fantasy a lot, about a loving, stable marriage with whomever I was crushing at the time. Having children, taking care of them, being cozy and surrounded by love. I knew reality is not always like that but I am strong and have not a weak stomach...\n\nEven then, when I was going on dates with guys from a conservative country, I could not help but freak out when they talked about marriage. The energy I was getting, was that \"I'll finally own someone\", \"I can let myself go\", \"Someone will do the hard work instead of me\". It was never energy of a loving commitment that you want to keep on going because you just love a person so much, which was my romantic idea of a marriage. No, it was an aggressive energy which felt like a means to an end for these men, something that said \"I win\".\n\nI once had a pregnancy scare, and I was afraid my parents would disown me if I indeed was pregnant then. My then bf said that he would marry me if that happened, and I could have the child, and we could go back to live and raise the child with his family. I was a teenager. In my home country it would have been legal to marry at my age.\n\nI was not imagining that at all. It would have made me lose my basic education and dignity to have a child at that age. Possibly even risk my life! I was hoping he would instead give me money for an abortion which I would then go to in secret.\n\nI was thinking about how the relationship has been - he never hugged me, kissed me unless I requested it, and only for a second. He tried turning every physical interaction into sex. He disapproved some of my interests and that discouraged me from making useful changes in my life. I then thought, if I am pregnant now, it is the end for me, and I will forever be stuck with someone whose love I have to beg for, who most likely has a crush on somebody else, is addicted to porn and is a proud pervert. I was disgusted.\n\nBefore that, I was hoping he would change, but the idea of marriage made me remember that men give even less effort inside of one. I saw the boomer comics, the housewife & husband media trope, the way how newlyweds vs long term married couples act. I was done. He wanted to use and own me, and a child would have been the perfect excuse for that. To separate me from family, to separate me from my education and a future where I could ever be independent.","title":"I used to be a romantic, but men talking about marriage, alluding to proposal and almost becoming pregnant scared me into reality","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/hsofqf\/i_used_to_be_a_romantic_but_men_talking_about\/"}

One of the reasons I want to go my own way from men and romance in general is because nothing lasts forever. I'm more comfortable accepting the people around me as temporary, because I'm also temporary. \n\nI often think about the idea of romance as a social construct and wonder if it was a big mistake. It just doesn't seem to work out for most people. Its a kind of \"love\" that causes so much pain in people's lives. We give power to another person to stomp on our hearts. And if it ends, either by death or break up, you're left with questions of \"what was it all for?\"  because you invested so much time and energy in this \"forever\" relationship.\n\n I'm comfortable with the relationship I have with my family and friends as well as idea of getting a pet in the future. I acknowledge that people come and go. But when you get in a relationship, especially having grown up with romantic movies where the cameras cut after they get married, you assume your relationship will be \"forever\". So you make a lot of forever decisions like having kids with that person, as well as investing a lot of time and energy under the assumption that nature will treat you kindly.\n\nI just can't live this way. No matter how attractive the idea of romance is. I feel like the price is too high, as well as the risk. I think that friendships are nicer, because you're not putting all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. It would be nice to have someone to be affectionate with and do cute relationship things with (in theory, cause in reality men are not worth it), but it really puts me off how there are so many variables. I just don't think romantic relationships are a good investment. \n\nBut this is coming from a non-religious person. Depending on what meaning you make of life, your perspective will be different.","title":"I'm put off by the \"forever\" aspect of romance","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/mj8lii\/im_put_off_by_the_forever_aspect_of_romance\/"}

Namely common tropes, cliches to avoid, reviews\/summaries of romance books (mostly romantasy and stuff out of booktok and such).\n\nAnd it just reminded me all over again why it is that I avoid hetero romances and why they've always given me the ick.\n\nIt's all just so... ewgh. The fact that these are written mostly by women for women and how wildly popular they are baffles me (\\*cough\\*Colleen Hoover\\*cough\\*).\n\nThe relationship dynamics are awful. The protagonists always look like they are made out of cardboard and the s\\*xual stuff is so... icky. I'm not even against intimacy, graphic scenes do not make me uncomfortable, it's just that the way it's done in het romances is so cringey, so creepy, such a turn off (like why does it always have to be violent, possessive, so weird? even rutting wild animals have more manners than some mainstream stuff I've read), the dynamic so borderline abusive and r\\*pe-y that I can't even laugh at how cringy it is cause it's just so uncomfortable.\n\nThe protagonists are usually so out of touch with each other other than some surface level \"oh he has daddy issues because his daddy didn't let him become an artist\", or \"she has low self esteem because her mother was a drug addict\" or some such tropey background story that they can trauma bond over, because it's always trauma bonding. They are SOOO in love with each other but once you scratch a little under the surface it's clear that all they have is lust codependency and very actual little empathy for each other.\n\nThey usually have very little in common other than maybe some hobby, there's not much going in the way of a mutual admiration or respect, the emotional intimacy scenes feel so lukewarm, so bland, so contrived in a cliche type of way.\n\nYou know, the whole Fifty Shades type of crap. It baffles me that there's grown women who are into being spanked and into this whole dynamic. I think this goes beyond daddy issues. There's something else at play that needs to be studied. I have daddy issues. Nothing makes me drier than having some guy act all dominant with me. There's nothing appealing about calling a dude you're fn \"daddy\". Just why would you even.\n\nThe scariest thing is how this mimics what a lot of het relationships are like, and how like I said these are written mostly by women for other women and teenage girls are all over this garbage making memes about it on tiktok. Sure I know tiktok is not the best example of literature but still, it's scary.\n\nDuring my research I've been shocked by example of women writing women (and men) that are so awful, so on par with \"she boobed boobily down the stairs\". Couple this with an obsession with virginity in romantasy, misogyny and \"not-like-other-girl\"-isms, the female protag being absolutely brutalized and\/or degraded s\\*xually, the concerning amount of grooming and partner violence, that I just have to wonder if this isn't all some sort of self-hatred p\\*rn and it's that degradation they are all really getting off to and not so much the het stuff itself.\n\nAnd then there's het women writing men which is just... not what you'd expect from women who are or have been married, have sons, you'd think they'd be able to relate to men a bit more due to proximity but they apparently don't??\n\nThe most clear example of what I am talking about is when women write gay (male) romances and there's always the big jock dude who's the most stereotypical het dudebro and the protagonist, who is literally a walking stereotype, and their whole relationship is defined by performative hetero gender roles. ([watch this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ja5AlY8ZbDo))\n\nI'm a het woman, I'm very much attracted to men, but I never liked het romances. Whether it be in books or other media. I wish I could find something I like without having to look into M\/M stuff like I did in my sordid past as a fanficnet user in my teens.\n\nWhy are women into this stuff? Is it patriarchal brainwashing? Self hatred?\n\nAside from your opinion on this, I also like to know what you like to see in a het (or not?) romance personally so I can get some good ideas.","title":"Why do hetero romances suck so much","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/1dyp2we\/why_do_hetero_romances_suck_so_much\/"}

Looking back, I shouldn't have been so intimidated by him. What the fuck could he even do to me? Nothing. People ask me \"Don't you ever get lonely?\" and I tell them \"To me, being single doesn't mean loneliness, it just means he cant hurt me anymore.\" and they usually assume the worst and feel bad for even asking. At first when we broke up, I missed having someone to cuddle and have sex with, but I got over that completely within a matter of months. Now I don't even care about that shit anymore and don't feel like I need it to be happy. To me, entering into a relationship with someone (especially marriage) sounds like signing my freedom away to become someone else's property. I'm not gonna let that happen. As long as I have my friends, I never feel lonely. I have everything I need in life, I don't feel incomplete, and if you do, you need to understand that a boyfriend isn't gonna solve that problem. You need to learn to love yourself like I did before anything else. I know this lifestyle isn't for everyone, but I personally feel like I function a lot better when I'm single. I  can be my own person, make my own decisions, and I don't have to pretend to be in love with someone just to make them happy. I say that because I don't think I've ever actually fallen in love with someone, and at this age, I feel like it'll probably never happen, maybe I'm aro. Of course, I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

Here you have the leader of a church that was responsible for horrific crimes against humanity, anti-LGBT, anti-abortion, antisemitic until Vatican II with their own property inventory, tax exempt status, hospitals, nunneries, etc. Theor hospitals can refuse abortion\/contraception based on religious purposes, muslims\/jews\/christians are allowed certain free speech privileges (anti-woman, anti-LGBT, etc.) that aren't afforded to any other groups of people because of religious freedom. Muslims and jews are allowed to murder animals in brutal ways, despite animal rights laws in place. Catholic priests are also allowed to withhold criminal evidence from law enforcement. Yet no one bats an eye.\n\nMaybe alongside feminism, we need to revive the Goddess, in who's image we're made, with men tasked to mainly protect her image (women) and with women focused on self actualisation as a form of whorship. That way in the name of the Goddess we can amass an untaxable real estate inventory, religious abortion clinics and any persecution of us can be seen as religious oppression (alongside misogyny, which people take less seriously). Copying the Catholic Church template (in terms of hierarchy) is especially important in terms of long time viability. The hierarchy being only women is especially important and the resources acquired being only in women's hands is also important. The goal should be a female-only Vatican type city\/nation state. The female hierarchy within the church should also be required to be celibate (so as to reduce the chance of a man trying to get their hands on any of the religious properties).\n\nThis would also give women from the third world who want to seek refuge in the West under the guise of religious persecution (instead of misogyny, which would be difficult to prove when you come from say Morocco or Indonesia) a more solid case.\n\nRedemption through our Goddess would also be something that would be available to prostituted\/criminal womem in a way that it's available to male criminals\/sex offenders\/sex pests\/etc. through islam\/christianity right now.

My friend looked so beautiful and elegant!\n\nAnd then I looked aside her at her husband. They had a traditional religious wedding and part of the ceremony involves sitting before the minister and then all the people are watching them. She was sitting up, at attention, and looked focused on the Minister. Her hands were folded nicely. Her husband was extremely slouching to the point where his hurt jacket didn't even look like it was on all the way and his eyes were off to outer space dating off... and his one hand was grabbing near his crotch! I was horrified and feel secondhand embarrassed for the bride. The groom looks like one of the slobby class clowns from high school goofing off and not paying attention during class, like the kid that always gets sent to the principles office...\n\nThey looked like night and day. In the rest of the photos he was making faces and didn't take it seriously at all while she was trying to be mature and professional. \n\nI dont believe in marriage and haven't been dating, and when I am out in public I ignore men that start hitting on me. Seeing her husband slouch and zone out and be in his crotch in front of a minister and whole church of people made me feel literally so sick. He was the one that proposed to her. Why is he already acting so miserable and like he doesn't want to be at his own wedding? He asked her. And then to pose like that? \n\nMy friend is like a many others who dream of their wedding and white dress their whole life. He knew that and he doesn't care to even pretend to pay attention at his own wedding. Im glad she is a former friend because I couldn't handle hearing any more of her stories about how awful he was during their time dating. \n\nThe wedding she had though made me loose even more hope for myself. It feels so abysmal. To be honest I distanced myself hard when she got engaged because I just didn't have the heart to be there and pretend to act happy for her when I can see the truth. I do hope he gets better for her but I doubt that will happen. \n\nHer husband is an extreme example but still most guys never seem to excited for their weddings, they act sort of like its a chore and boring.

Here is a quote that made me think of this subreddit:\n\n\"Women especially have been socialized not to show their anger. Women are allowed to cry, to mourn openly, to get depressed, and to show tenderness, but anger is considered unbecoming to women in our society. As a result, many women are attracted to partners who can act out their anger for them. In this way, they can discharge some of their repressed anger vicariously. Unfortunately, however, many of these men who get angry easily are also controlling and abusive. It is essential to your well-being to learn to deal with anger effectively.'\n\nI know I'm severely depressed bc of my repressed rage. I have every right to be angry. Healing as a traumatized woman in this society is incredibly difficult. I deeply despise my abusers. I deeply despise this world where women get dehumanized and are expected to react to this injustice with a smile. I hate that misogynists socialize us to repress our anger and then claim that being submissive is in our nature. It's not. All women are pissed off, many just aren't aware of it.\n\nAnd I hate that abused women often get blamed for their abuser's behaviour. I am very glad that I personally have no interest in dating men. Many women aren't that lucky. We get brainwashed by society and then we get blamed for being brainwashed. It's insidious. We need to reclaim our lives and our power by valuing and managing our rage.\n\nAnyway, I really need to go deep into the woods again and scream until I almost vomit my guts out tbh. I need to externalize my rage. I have it all bottled up and it makes me feel depressed.

But always let the guys off the hook, not even criticizing them for not being able to keep it in their pants. Young girls shouldn't have that much pressure at such a young age to be deemed worthy of a husband that they haven't even met yet. Let young girls make mstakes, be human, and grow. Teenage boys aren't told to stay pure, to watch what they wear, behave well, be good guys for their future wife. It's a given that their future wife will accept them as they are, because that's what women do. The message is that women should give unconditional love and overlook all their man's shortcomings, but that they need to do xyz and adhere to very strict code of conduct to deserve love. We need to stop encouraging low self-esteem in young girls, because with that mindset they grow up and become women who are constantly looking for validation from men and through relationships with them.\n\nFor context I grew up in very misogynistc places (it was mostly arabs who were muslim) and it's not until I discovered feminism that I was able to put into words what was happening around me.

Less than 5% in North Africa and west Asia. \n\nWomen are single handedly suffering menstruation which starts around 12 on an average. Resources on menstrual health are far and few between.\n\n 70- 90% of us experience brutal cramps and dysmenorrhoea which doctors agree can be as severe as a heart attack. You won't send a man suffering a heart attack to the war right? \n\nMen know full well an average woman has lesser muscle mass and which makes it impossible for women to defend anyone and risk getting raped. \n\nThey bring out a strawman to bring down feminism and to rage bait people into becoming misogynists\/ antifeminists and incels. \n\nFor example, antifeminists in South Korea have been using this as a gotcha against feminism and to keep hating on women AND they're against women taking menstrual leave. Look at An San, Korean triple Olympic Gold medalist getting hated because of short hair. \n\nWhy are feminists appeasing to such men? Have you not seen how hard feminists have to fight for EVERY SINGLE right women have? When have men as a class collectively decided to do something better for women as a class? \n\nDo most women get property and inheritance? They get passed down through the male line and women are afraid of going against their fathers and brothers because they're her best bet against her in-laws' abuse. \n\nWhy do feminists go \"women should be drafted when necessary\" when we don't even own the very land we have to defend while tolerating the extreme pain menstruation causes when the men don't even take birth control or wear condoms because they're uncomfortable? How many men die during pregnancy or childbirth? \n\nWell if you want women to fight in the military so bad, then send men to care for AIDS patients where women account for 66-90% of care givers and take blood from men to makeup for the menstrual blood women lose. The blood can be used to treat people in the hospitals, research etc. Start taking blood when the boy reaches 12. \n\nEqual fights equal blood. If women lose monthly blood so should men. \n\nI'm done seeing men still want to enslave women (many waiting anxiously for artificial wombs) and then try to lure feminists into their twisted mess. \n\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/news\/in-focus\/commission-on-the-status-of-women-2012\/facts-and-figures","title":"Why are men allowed to make bad faith claims to dismiss feminism and why are feminists giving in?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/t1byf8\/why_are_men_allowed_to_make_bad_faith_claims_to\/"}

That is it. \n \nTheir egos get so hurt by it because they feel like they are being accused of something. They will go to their friends make jokes about it, make angry rants, go around harassing women on the internet web. Reason being, they have internalized their self importance since they were toddlers. They think that when a woman says something they are seeking attention and being hysterical but when they open their mouths their words have more meaning than anything that could exist. \n\n\nMisogyny on the other hand has been expressed physically by men who are willing to kill women to prove that point. These men go out there and take a gun to specifically shoot women or run a van over them or bomb them because women have it easy. \n\nThis is the reasoning behind attacks by men. Women have it easy. Let\u2019s draw that down. \n\n\t1.\tShe can date whoever she wants.\n\t2.\tWomen can get what they want at anytime especially sex. L\n\t3.\tWomen get married to rich men and then divorce rape them when the men cheats. (It\u2019s not fair cause money should be a reason to validate lack of respect in a relationship :sad face: ) \n\t4.\tWomen have a lot of sex (but not with me) so they should die instead. ( ???) What kind of reasoning is this. \n\t5.\tWomen want to settle when they are older and have tasted every other penis in a 200 km radius. ( again women aren\u2019t your property and can do whatever they wish without your permission)\n\t6.\tShe is a woman so she\u2019s a whore by default. \n\n\nAll these reasons, all sexual reasons are the justification for women getting murdered or abused everyday around the world. In places like India a man will kill his wife and children if he gets fired from his job and then commit suicide. The incredibly selfish nature of a human male is so astounding that when you observe it from afar you can see through the layers of deceit that we as a society have internalized as \u201cnormal cause he is a man\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s fucked up to be expected to just stay silent whilst you are trapped in a money-hungry society on a polluted planet that\u2019s headed to hell, world leaders who have confidence without any clarity, surrounded by the morbid reality of what it\u2019s like to be woman with men who feel like you as a woman saying something is infringing on their ability to store and produce semen. \n\nHere\u2019s my personal take on this issue: Just no men. \n70% of drama in a woman\u2019s life comes from interactions with males. As a young girl, you\u2019ll get harassed by males; your cousins, uncles and neighbours boys are just amongst those in the proximity of using you as the object of their pleasure. Then as you grow up the whole date, mate and breed thing causes stress to the woman more than the man. You worry about looking pretty, worry about being killed or kidnapped, worry about stranger having STDs, worry about getting pregnant. You pray that the pervert didn\u2019t record you with a camera and is now going to sell the video or just put it on a website for status gain amongst his peers.  God forbid it that you get married, you turn into a whore-maid and have to support your household with half of your income and also cook, clean, give birth, stay in shape, be a good mother to your husband and kids, prepare lunches, bathe the kidiots, remind your husband to shower or else you\u2019ll suffocate as you perform fellation on his stinky crotch.  Day by day your soul gets sucked through a straw and you end up looking exhausted and miserable compared to women who are single, unmarried without kids. Afterwards be prepared for \u201ca man to be a man\u201d so he\u2019ll cheat on you with a younger woman. You request divorce which will be a hard thing since you\u2019ve built your life around the concept of a husband but all he is thinking of is how you\u2019ll get half of everything you both worked for and how that hurts him because he expects you to start from scratch... cause men are delusional apes. That\u2019s why. \nIf you cut that out, you cut yourself 70% of all the shit males bring to the table. \n\nInvest in a good sex toy, use it as per your requirements. Stays erect all the time and won\u2019t complain when you don\u2019t use it for a while. Vibrators are an awesome investment. For company, find a pet, a bunny or cat or a goat or a small dog, chickens are good too. Find a hobby that gets you busy enough to stay away from all the buzz; reading, writing, swimming or teaching whichever suits you I\u2019m just putting my own thing here. If you can volunteer, well and good. \n \nThe other 30%, 20 is caused by family, if you have a shitty family you can cut them off completely. Just no contact if all they do is just suck the life out of you, they want you to go for holidays all so they can have someone to do the dishes. Hmmm.  Or they want you there so they can focus on you as a problem rather than have a rational conversation with you. Hmmm. \nYou are under no obligation to be polite to your abusers. Cut them off if you can. \n\nThe other ten percent will come from things you can\u2019t avoid. Morning commute, workplace, shopping, bills, meal planning, laundry, life goals e.g saving up to buy a farm or build your own cottage away from people. This is what I call the Eustress. It\u2019s the good kind that motivates you instead of draining and sucking the soul out of you. \n\nAlways remember when someone invalidates your point of view whether on the internet web or in real life, doesn\u2019t translate that you have been fighting an imaginary enemy, it\u2019s a reminder that only the guilty feel offended. This is to the girls getting harassed when they post to mainstream subs. \n\nYou are not missing out on anything if you don\u2019t get men to fawn over you. Propose to you. Fight over you. Lust for you. Call you pretty. Worship you. None of these mean a thing if they\u2019re going to drop you like a hot potato once you stop making their peepees hard or worse end up killing you out of jealous testosterone fits. \n\nBlessed be you and stay alive.","title":"Misandry irritates, misogyny kills.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/eh9wec\/misandry_irritates_misogyny_kills\/"}

Of course, posts from women seeking support will always be allowed.\n\n**What is still allowed:**\n\n* Personal venting\/asking for advice. E.g. when dealing with male family members, everyday sexism, workplace discrimination,...\n* Posts about why it is better for women to be single, e.g. linking articles - **those should be focusing on women, not on men.**\n* Venting about sexism (e.g. the recent post we had about men not doing dishes after thanksgiving).\n* Screenshots of antifeminist's post with funny replies (think murdered by words, but a feminist version). Replies must be included in the screenshot and the focus must clearly be on the reply. These posts should be tagged as humour.\n\n**What is not allowed:**\n\n* Crossposting\/screenshotting posts from incel-subs or subs like r\/relationships that show awful behaviour of men.\n* News articles about a certain case of male violence - if we post all examples of male violence here, there would be multiple posts every second and the sub would overflow. There are subs better suited for this, e.g.  [r\/nametheproblem](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nametheproblem\/). We know that the majority of violent acts is committed by men, there is no reason to remind us.\n* Other posts or links to misogynist media in and outside of reddit, with the purpose to point out awful male behaviour e.g. foxnews.\n\nIn short, the goal is to keep content about men at a minimum, while still providing women the possibility to vent and seek support.

I want to share my experience the past couple of years with you guys. About two years ago, I decided I had enough and I wanted to make a change. First step was that I bought a cheap, terrible plane ticket to visit Brazil and stayed for a month. My round trip was like $550 on Avianca and the apartment I rented here was about $300usd. Almost right away when I arrived, I decided to move to Brazil. That was in May. July I sold all my furniture and everything I owned except for two duffel bags, and I moved to Brazil. \n\nThe past couple of years I had busted my ass working as a registered nurse case manager in hospice. I decided to work as many hours as I could and live in the cheapest apartment in a reasonably safe area that I could find. I stopped going out on weekends and saved as much as I could. Several years in a row I put my tax return into an IRA, which my employer matched. This year I withdrew my IRA without penalty so that I could buy real estate. \n\nAugust I arrived in Brazil and started looking at houses\/property to buy. I ended up buying a 735 square meter parcel of land next to the rainforest preserve for $50,000 reais (at the time around $9500 usd). It is a magical place, you guys. I considered something on the island, houses in the city, but I fell in love with this place. \n\nI didn't have a car when I moved here (took the bus everywhere), and paid only a few hundred usd per month in rent and utilities. By January, I will have around $40,000usd in total for the construction of my house. I bought a 1991 model car here this past month for around $1800usd which gets me where I need to go. It's a Gurgel, which looks like a little Jeep, and is reasonably easy to work on and fun to drive. \n\nI will drill a well on my property, install solar power, and plant fruit trees and vegetables. My property is near a lagoon where I can fish. I am trying to learn as many things as I can about how to be self sufficient. Once the house is built and paid for, I will owe nothing and be free and clear of mortgage, car payment, etc. \n\nMy first college degree was a bachelor of fine arts. I went back to take a degree in nursing about 7 years ago specifically so that I could afford to get myself into this position. There are tons of good, well paying jobs for nurses once you put a couple of years in doing hospital work and start getting certifications. Working remotely is easy. The pay is good. The exchange rate from dollar to Brazilian real is around five and a half right now (I am depending on a rate of 1:6 to pay for my house construction). \n\nI'm here to help other women who are interested in doing something similar. I believe that the freedom that comes with having your own house free and clear and being self sufficient is one of the greatest things we can do for ourselves. I am 43 this year, and it took me a while to realize this was my path. I moved to another country by myself, learned the language, and will make a wonderful life here. I believe in you guys and your dreams too.","title":"woman homeowner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/gdsj6a\/woman_homeowner\/"}

My culture has sort of a mix of progressive and regressive practices. One of the progressive practices is that women are encouraged to have high education and high paying career. But the thing is, women are still expected to take care of the family. I see so many women doing too much and the division of labor is not equal (imho it will never be equal because there's nothing equal to pregnancy and reproductive labor). Double shift is real. \n\nWasn't there a matriarchal society in China or some other place and the way I see it, the women do all the labor and men don't do anything, they literally just have sex with women \ud83d\udc80\n\nI don't know why other feminists think matriarchy is the ultimate feminist ideal when it should be female separatism. I'm not taking care of men just because they call me a leader girlboss.\n\nEdit:\n\nPeople are defining matriarchy differently, I don't even know what's the standard definition anymore. I only originally tried to talk about how if women are in charge, it's just going to be more work for us if a matriarchal society includes men.\n\nSome are defining matriarchy as changing policies to cater to women's needs and rights. I thought this was just mainstream feminism -fighting for women's rights but still functioning in a society with men. Not that I don't support gaining women's rights. Gaining women's rights even under patriarchy is instrumental for women to achieve separatism, which should be the end goal of feminism. \n\nSome are saying it's a flip of patriarchy wherein men are enslaved. I mean I don't want to live with men even if they are our slaves. And also, we already had this discussion. No xy hierarchical thinking. Additionally, women can't subjugate men the way they subjugate us because the root of our oppression is sex based.\n\nSome are also defining matriarchy as centering motherhood. As a separatist, I'm obviously against this. Here's a link of an article about mosuo matriarchal women and how they're stigmatized if they don't have children\n\n [https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2017\/apr\/01\/the-kingdom-of-women-the-tibetan-tribe-where-a-man-is-never-the-boss](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2017\/apr\/01\/the-kingdom-of-women-the-tibetan-tribe-where-a-man-is-never-the-boss)\n\nNotice how most define it as still living in a society with men. We're separatist and it's the exact opposite of our principles. Matriarchy will only work if we're also separate from men and reject patriarchal practices. \n\nI posted this on other subs, many have interesting replies.

He wants a second change but she\u2019s already in the progress to sign the divorce papers. \n\nAnd that woman could have been me. \n\nNow I realise the best husband in the world is myself, only I know what my true needs are and If I just form a habit to put myself first at all times live everyday with the idea that I belong to myself imagine how great and exciting life would be.","title":"The singer Maya inspired me to go sologamy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/q83566\/the_singer_maya_inspired_me_to_go_sologamy\/"}

Where our ideas around realtionships and marriage are at odds with people around us and they take it personally.  \nI had sermons, like \"being with the right person is a beautiful aspect of life\" from other single people who are agressively pursuing relationships. And I didn't even said I was going to be single for life at that point. But as soon as someone says anything remotely negative abt romantic relationships, the propaganda is shoved down our throats almsot immediately, to make us fall in line.  \nAnd even my female friends are constantly asking\/pressuring abt when I will have a boyfriend.It's **exhausting**.Women especially, have been told from day 1 their job in life is to make themselves wife-material, we have absorbed this mesaging on a subconscious level. Therefore any criticism or disdain at their role (not themselves but their role as wife or gf) or their partner might be viewed as a personal attack.  \nI don't have a definite answer when it comes to navigating friendships around ppl like that, friendship is still important to me, but sometimes there's so much pressur to fall in line and be like evrybody else, that's something I always struggled with.","title":"When people don't understand the concept of not centering relationships","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/ny7pfb\/when_people_dont_understand_the_concept_of_not\/"}

It's exactly what they did. One old classmate is actually posting about her lousy marriage. She is constantly overwhelmed from taking care of her young kids, cleaning, cooking, teaching them during covid, and then taking care of her man child on top of it. Then he wanted a dog, and of course she does all the work. Her posts constantly reassure me that settling for a man is never worth it. \n\nI understand there are lousy marriages but even when I think of the possibility of finding a more mature man that actually provides and takes care of himself, picks up after himself, does his share of chores etc it seems like a roomate situation. What is the real perk of being married? You could just get a roomie instead if you need to split bills. \n\nI am 26 and recently moved and people in this area especially other women make small talk with me asking if I am married\/ have kids, then make a face when I say no. To me it is strange, and seems so personal. My landlord was also acting weird that I wanted to rent a house rather than an apartment and made the comment that I don't have kids so why the space? (I work from home and workout here) my grandma made a comment I told her about my move and I was super excited and she sounded depressed and said \"don't you ever want to find someone? you're so far from home\". \n\nNo one in my family had a healthy marriage. Plus, my father was a deadbeat dad and just generally acted like a man child, didn't believe in education, and slacked his way through life doing the bare minimum in everything. I initially get attracted to men who I always think are better than my dad and have good qualities like my grandpa and somehow all the men I've been with end up revealing their true colors and they are all like my deadbeat dad! \n\nNo matter what I've tried doing to find a better catch (when I was dating) it didn't matter. At the end of the day they all turned out to be the same: no ambition, lazy, broke\/awful with money, just want to sit around and have me plan all the dates, have me cook and clean for them, and they all were absolutely disgusting slobs. They never wanted to celebrate major holidays or celebrate my\/their birthday either. \n\nI can't win the fight when \"winning\" here just means settling for some man child (or at best a roomate), so why fight at all? I stepped outside the ring and like doing my own thing. I am so tired of society shaming women for deciding to be single. \n\nLove is also the most dangerous and scary \"drug\" because my rose colored glasses would get thick so fast, and my whole way of thinking was altered. I couldn't help but to be daydreaming of a man I was dating, let myself get too emotional, and feeling like I couldn't unplug myself and have an outside life. Even wben I tried to unplug, I'd just keep thinking about the man. When guys would flake out or say they were talking with their ex or whatever, and I would dump them I'd act tough, then cry the whole way home and feel depressed for the next week. It would always get the best of me. Life is so much easier when I'm not tripping over myself for these guys.","title":"Settling down is just settling.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/md0lok\/settling_down_is_just_settling\/"}

I don\u2019t necessarily mind those things if it was with the right person under the right circumstances but it never was. \n\nRelationships caused me SO much pain that I just started to prefer being alone then deal with the confusion, pain and headache of dating and relationships.\n\nSo here I am working and mostly being alone.

Hadn't seen my extended family in a long time. I was able to wear a dress (that I hadn't worn in YEARS - tbh I didn't think I'd ever be able to wear it again). I got so many compliments that day.\n\nMy aunt - my mom's brother's wife (she's in her early 60s) noticed right away how much weight I lost. It was the first time someone has ever come to me for weight loss advice! She is significantly overweight and wanted to change her life. She said to me:\n\n\"What have you been doing? You look incredible. Also...there's something different about your face - it's glowing!\"\n\nMy soul delighted upon hearing that. I shared with her my experience, emphasizing that it really is about diet and finding a type of exercise that you really enjoy. For me, I began walking over the summer and I never looked back. I hated the gym, doing pilates, any other floor exercise because nothing stuck for me. I never entertained the idea of specific diets (such as keto, etc.) because in my opinion, they are not sustainable. I wanted to establish a lifestyle change.\n\nI started 2021 at just over 180 lbs (I'm 5'6F, 28 years old) and ended this year at 147 lbs (I went from clinically obese to a normal BMI). I couldn't be any prouder of myself. I never thought I'd be able to lose my weight. For some reason, it seemed like a far off dream. I knew though that I deserved to look and feel my best. I was tired of declining social invitations, clothes not fitting me (my mom's clothes didn't fit me either), dreading the stores and having to try on clothes because I knew nothing would fit, walking up the stairs and feeling short of breath, feeling unattractive, etc.\n\nAnd so...I got to work with these results to finish off this year! I'm still not at my goal weight yet. I'm aiming for 120 lbs (which hopefully I can accomplish in 2022). I've also been going to church a lot and focusing a lot on my spirituality (to help with my self-esteem), thinking about hobbies I'd like to pursue this new year (I'll be tutoring for Kumon, and partaking in flower design - like making flower garlands\/bouquets\/flower crowns, etc. My dad's secretary does this for a hobby and is willing to teach me! I'm so excited!\n\nCareer is still being sorted out - but I know in due time I will have a job (a medical residency) at some stage in 2022. I finished medical school in 2019 and have been back home with my parents since. I've had great difficulty with my board licensing exams. This year I failed one of them and am studying to re-take it in Mid-January. Gonna make sure I kill it this time.\n\nOne of my best friends embarked on her self-love journey earlier on (you never really finish because it is for life). She told me that even people who were considered \"more successful\" - fancy titles, high-powered positions\/social status, affluent, etc. noticed the glow she exuded. They wanted to know what she was doing. Isn't that interesting?\n\nShe even said something that really resonated with me: That most people\/our society is very \"success\"-oriented. Placing our worth and value on those external measures of success - Awards\/accolades\/honor\/fame\/power\/prestige\/high degrees, etc. but not enough on growth\/personal development\/self-love. The latter three (and other areas in this particular realm) are what people neglect. Either because they are not self-aware or any other reason. This is why MOST people are\/remain dissatisfied with themselves\/their lives because they haven't looked inward. This is the true, deep and soulful work that enriches our lives and gives us meaning.\n\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned in 2021:\n\nSelf-love\/contentment\/fulfillment is INDEPENDENT of your employment\/relationship status (which society places so much emphasis on). It truly is an inside job and it's a daily work in progress. And remember, what really defines you? It's your heart and character.

Today we weeded and put down fresh pine straw around the trees out front where you enter the garden. \n\nThere are 2 women that got hired on along with me and a woman who is a Master Gardener and have been volunteering there for 3 years. One of the new girls has a long distance boyfriend. She is here for school working on her M.D. She is super sweet. \n\nAs for the other, she is a retired Air Force Veteran. She worked as a nurse. I know she has a (grown) son but I don't see a ring on her finger (though, then again, we do work in the dirt). She hasn't mentioned a husband or lack thereof. She did mention moving out of state to eventually go to Grad school (she is working on her second Bachelor's atm), so I'm lowkey getting WGTOW vibes. I hope she opens up eventually so I can know for certain. She is sweet as well. We car pooled together to get lunch in her car. We are basically strangers! \n\nAs for the volunteer woman, she is def WGTOW. She retired early from IT. She has an ex husband and never remarried and has no children other than 3 cats that live with her in the house she and her ex husband bought together. Idk what happened between them but I think it is awesome to be working with someone who is literally going her own way. The Garden wanted to hire her on and she was like nope- I want to come and go as I please.

OH, and did I mention she is sweet too? Everyone is. :') \n\nI am so happy to be working with a group of women who enjoy being outdoors and are pleasant. There is a building out away from all the other ones that is tucked away from where the visitors usually tour. There is a screened patio on it and we have decided to clean it up and put a table in it and chairs, put a lock on it (so if visitors do try to explore it, they can't) and make it our \"Hort Girls\" lunch spot for our breaks. \n\nI'm feeling blessed because Agriculture is a male dominant field (the Horticulture supervisor is a man) but the staff are majority women and it is so nice to be working with all women on my team!! \n\nJust wanted to share the news with you all.

I trusted and looked up to my father until I became older and started to realize his behaviour and attitude towards me was not ok. I started noticing his toxic and controlling nature that I failed to notice in childhood because I was too young to know better, and for a long time I liked the attention. Apparently everyone else saw it though, but stood by and did nothing.\n\nMy relationship with my dad was thrown in my face by my older siblings by assuming that if mom and dad divorced I'd go with dad because he has all the money. For context, my half siblings were young when my mom divorced their bio dad so they were still hurt by that experience, hated my dad and was probably hoping mom would divorce him. They saw my close relationship with my dad as a betrayal to mom and used it as a weapon against me when I had no idea what I did wrong. It made me feel like a terrible daughter and that my siblings hate me.\n\nIt was true though, that at one point he had all the money because my mom took time off work to raise me but my dad was the only one that did stuff with me. Outings, and car trips, sports events and movies. Even though I was raised by my mom all day while dad worked, we didn't bond or got to know each other. She was always emotionally distant. Mom emotionally detached herself from me probably because she'd lose me if they did separate, so she didn't want to get close.\n\nI am a victim of covert, or emotional incest.\n\n\"Emotional incest is not sexual. Instead, this type of unhealthy emotional interaction blurs the boundaries between adult and child in a way that is psychologically inappropriate. When a parent looks to their child for emotional support or treats them more like a partner than a child, it is considered emotional or \u201ccovert\u201d incest. The outcome of this family structure often produces similar results \u2014 on a lesser scale \u2014 as sexual incest.\"\n\n\"In addition to the difficulties of pinpointing what\u2019s wrong, a child may enjoy some of the feelings that come from emotional incest. They may feel important or special because they are their parent\u2019s chosen confidante. Although they most likely know they are being treated differently than children around them, the feeling of maturity can be exhilarating. Children can also have a sense of feeling helpful or even powerful since they are the ones guiding their parent along an adult journey. For all of these reasons, it is difficult for a child to ask for support.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/psychcentral.com\/blog\/emotional-incest-when-is-close-too-close\/\n\nThis article says it all for me.\n\nMy dad parentified me since birth to cater to his emotional needs but he never helped me when I needed emotional support. My pain was always treated as not a big enough deal or he's been through worse so I better suck it up, but everyone better bend over backwards if his needs aren't met. I learned how to keep my feelings to myself and never learned healthy coping strategies. I feel shame when I cry in front of others. I feel weak for not being strong enough and that seeking therapy is for losers (I don't believe this is true, but it hurts my heart to feel that way) and it's stopped me from seeking help.\n\nMy dad brainwashed me against my mom and sabotaged my relationship with her. He would openly talk about how bad his marriage was, how shitty his sexlife was, his money troubles, how much he hated her, his past hookups, his degrading sexual jokes about women that harmed my view of being a woman (=bad) and my sexuality (=gross).\u00a0\n\nEverything I did, everything I said family members would say \"you're just like your father\". My accomplishments were used to elevate his ego and passed around to show what a good parent he was. I was never treated as someone with their own identity.\n\nHe even\u2026 my father once tried to convince me to kill my mom at one point. I vividly remember him informing me that if I murdered her I'd likely be sentenced as a juvenile because of my age at the time, and that it \"wasn't a big deal\" if I went through with it. Who talks to children like that!!? Was he wishing that I'd do it? As a young girl who loved her father, what if I listened and actually did it? Because this type of scenario does happen!\n\nI've never told anyone about this until now.\n\nShockingly though, despite his brainwashing I had the intelligence not to listen. I never hated my mother, I don't recall ever treating her poorly or lashing out at her but she chose to keep her distance from me and not to establish a relationship with me because it was easier than dealing with him. It's weird because as a kid, all I wanted was something as simple as to brush our teeth together or cook together but it always felt like my mom and I stayed in separate areas of the house and never spent long periods of time in a room together. I never had a female role model to look up too.\n\nThat's all I have time for before this gets too long. I tried to stay on topic and left some things out that didn't have anything to do with my reasons for going my own way because my relationship with my whole family is fractured but tried to keep the focus on my dad because he is at the center of almost all of the drama. However, I have a lot more stories to tell but maybe for another time.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm attracted to men but I never had the desire to date them. I'm uncomfortable with sexuality, especially female sexuality, and so repulsed by the idea of being emotionally available and trusting to someone else that I'd rather be alone.\n\nAlthough, right now I live with two female roommates, have a job with a female boss and a majority of female co-workers, and I have a female doctor (a big deal because I had a very bad gyno experience with a male doctor). I'm still searching for mental and emotional safety.","title":"I(28) am a wgtow because of my toxic relationship with a manipulative man that lasted for a quarter of my life.

To make it short, she was an Italian nun who went to the US right in the middle of the massive wave of Italian immigration where the Italian community was segragated, victim of racism and lived in very poor conditions. Her smalll congregation founded orphanages and hospitals. Later she was canonized by the Vatican, she is the first American saint (ofc they made up some stuff that she cured people, I don't see the need to make up that, her work alone should make her fit to be a saint lol).\n\nAnyway, this movie made me realize that, back in the old days, if you wanted to be a wgtow, the easiest way was to be a nun. You had practically no other way because you were either a nun or you had to marry to avoid being a burden to your family. And look at what they achieve, especially the ones that do missionary work. It's amazing what you can achieve when you're not wasting your energy and mental load in useless romantic dramas. Even if they don't do missionary work, some of them seem to live a really peaceful life (if you exclude all the praying mumble jumble) in a community of women and I think it was an easy way to get access to some education and better life conditions if they came from poor families. \n\nI can't help but find it ironic that some women found freedom from men in the midst of one of the institutions that most contributed\/contributes to the spreading of pathiarchy. Obviously this was not that perfect, they are still considered second class members of the institution they belonged to and some got involved with priests. I would never associate with the Church, but I do find curious that you can find a feminist in the middle of such an opressive institution.","title":"Just noticed a very weird paradox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/1d628lj\/just_noticed_a_very_weird_paradox\/"}

(I was later discharged for depression.) My hair is naturally black and I had dyed it in different shades of blonde, red, and brown. I had to dye it black and since I had so much hair the dye dripped on my uniform.\n\n\nFor years my mom was so obsessed with it. I remembered when I was little she would get angry with some kid who put sand in it and would cleanse it with some stuff that smelled like alcohol. When I was in middle school someone put gum in my hair so I cut out the gum and she made me feel bad for doing it. There was also a time she called the police on me because she didn't know where I was when I was heading to school for summer school and she should have known that. And she complained to me how my hair wasn't done when I left. She would force me to get burning relaxers. This woman would drive miles to a certain salon just to go  get it done. Because she didn't want to do it herself.\n\n\nI could never have my hair down. She always put it in a ponytail. And she would put these painful accessories in it. I later learned that that she had cut her hair short years ago, it never grew back, and she regretted it ever since. It made me realize she was projecting her regrets on to me. Or just envied me for my long hair.\n\nShaving my head gave me a sense of a fresh start. I didn't know how to take care of it. My mom never taught me how because she preferred taking me to salons. Having short hair made it easier for me to learn how to care for it. \n\nI also enjoy wearing wigs. Most of them are brown because I like having brown hair. I can now have either short or long brown hair without having to worry about dyes.

I am the first one from my extended family to ever go to college, honestly the only educated people I met in my life were my teachers at school.\n\nI was bullyed throughtout my childhood due to my looks mostly by guys. I spent my teen years with so much body issues, depression and anxiety. I craved so much male attention yet I thought I was so ugly no man would ever look at me. When I finally started exploring the dating world (only when I was 23-24) I had such a low self esteem. I remember being so worried about getting to know the guy, what he wants sexually, because I wanted to be a cool girl that would treat him so well, not like those bitchy women. I felt unworthy when an handsome guy liked me and felt I needed to try to do the right stuff and try extra hard to please him.\n\nNow I sometimes read some reddits posts from the subreddits I used to go and...something changed. When a guy says I want X, Y, Z I no longer feel inferior for not having all what he asks. I just think he is full of shit and are happy I don't have to put up with that crap lol.\n\nI still have some troubles saying no and feel guilty when I turn down a guy. I can't help but have those annoying thoughts in the back of my head saying I am not that good so I shouldn't be as picky otherwise I'll end up alone and some day I'll regret it... Problem is, this fear is no longer enough to make me want to give my freedom to tolerate bullshit.\n\nSometimes my body issues come back, but then I am like... \"who cares?\". I just been finding some very cute plus sized models on instagram. Today I found one who filmed a tiktok video with a guy asking her to rate herself in a scale of 1 to 10 and she was like, with no doubt \"I am a 10\" and the guy kept trying to put her down questioning her \"are you sure? to be a 10 you need to be flawless\" and she was like \"yap I am a 10\" with so much confidence. According to her, it pissed a lot of dudes on tiktok. But I just loved it! and also her body shape is similar to mine and when I was younger I would never image I'd see someone with a body similar to mine being a model...\n\nI used to feel inferior due to my lack of sexual and relationship experience, now, since my last failed crush, not even that bothers me that much anymore. I feel like if I meet someone and that's an issue for that person, than that person should go see a shrink and get the fuck out of my life, because I don't have a problem with it so neither should he LOL I am a bit worried if this is repressed emotions or something and will blow out later. Not sure. But I just don't feel a lot of drive to pursue those things as much as before.\n\nI am sure I am still damaged and have a lot of emotional traumas, but I think I was able to grow some self esteem thanks to communities like this one and others that I found along the way. Definetely without the Internet and the digital age I wouldn't have evolved because I wouldn't know there's other people like me out there and that I am valid.","title":"How the fuck did I become a wgtow?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/ncnp7q\/how_the_fuck_did_i_become_a_wgtow\/"}

My ex would never let me do it. Not even as accent pieces. Because \"what would my friends think when they came over?\". So I bought the most garish girly furniture I could find and filled my apartment. A chair shaped like hot pink lips. A bright orange lamp with hanging crystals and maribou feather trim. A Hello Kitty toaster. I glued hot pink pom pom trim to the bottoms of the roller blinds. I even bought a hot pink metallic Christmas tree. I stopped at the flower shop every week and bought a new exotic bloom for the vase in the dining room. My daughter was 5 and she told me as a teen that her best memories were from living in our Barbie dream condo with me. \n\nMy second husband was mostly content to let me decorate how I wanted when we first moved in together. His only stipulation was no white furniture. (Currently almost 100% of my furniture is white, since we separated a year and a half ago). But I never stay the same person for long. I evolve and I grow and I seek new interests and new obsessions. I got a small tattoo when I was 19 that was pretty much always covered by clothing. When I was 36 I got a second, larger one, on my ankle. When I got a large chest piece that spans from shoulder to shoulder and up to my collar bone, my second husband tried to dissuade me. When he came home from work and I had gotten my lip pierced, he was kind of angry. \"What if I decide to run for public office?\" he said. When I replaced all the dishes in the cabinet with handmade pottery I hunted for at flea markets and second hand stores, he complained. When I hung up new paintings he would say \"it's ok to have negative space, you know\". I strained at the feeling of restriction. I started boxing. I went on trips by myself. I stopped at the bar after work, just to sit and have someone else make me dinner and have a drink. Watch a metal band. \n\nUnsurprisingly I could not stay in an environment that felt stifling much longer. My daughter moved out. And I moved first into her old bedroom and then out of the state to a city where I knew nobody. \n\nI got my own apartment with a pool and a dishwasher (never could have happened in the high COL big city that my ex refused to ever leave). I started making friends again. I accepted any and all invitations that I possibly could because I no longer had to account for my whereabouts to anyone else. \n\nI bought a tiny 2 seat subcompact car that I had wanted for my whole life. I started going to nightclubs on Saturday nights, ass to elbows, smoking weed on the rooftop deck. I found a cheap ticket to Sydney and went for it. Stayed in hostels and brought only one backpack. Hiked the coast and took the bus to the beach. Went to museums, spent an hour just looking at the grocery store, went to nightclubs and danced till 4am.  \n\nI sleep on my couch if I feel like it. Don't lose hours of my week cleaning up after anyone else. Can decide to go to a haunted house, strip club, or black light drag show with my friends at the last second if I want to. I have my friends over often. We cook a meal, watch movies, swim in the pool at my apartment complex, decorate Christmas cookies, do mushrooms. We go on impromptu road trips to Colorado. Someday maybe Vegas. \n\nThings aren't always easy. Relying on one income can be dicey. If I get sick there are no other paychecks coming in. I often feel like I'm on a college kid budget again. But that means I prioritize the experiences that will stay with me for a lifetime. I travel as much as I can. Whether that means driving to an old mining town an hour away for the day, or flying across the world on a shoestring budget. I visit my daughter and we actually appreciate our time together and have fun because no one is responsible for anyone else or has to answer to anyone else. \n\nOne thing that makes me appreciate my almost total freedom instead of being bummed about living from paycheck to paycheck is my knowledge that my first husband, who is in prison for abusing my daughter, cannot do even the simplest of things that I enjoy daily. I don't take anything for granted. Not having sushi at a restaurant, not going to a crowded concert and sitting on the grass, not laying on the couch after work binge watching whatever the hell I want. He fucked up and lost his freedom, so I will make even more effort to enjoy mine out of spite. \n\nI will never again allow my spirit to be tamed by societal expectations or gender roles I do not accept. I can't subject myself to that sort of confinement again.","title":"WGTOW is a life unburdened","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/el8eyi\/wgtow_is_a_life_unburdened\/"}

The guide shared some interesting facts. Some context, in 1936, Spain had a leftist government that want to take away properties from landowners and create public schools as well as give rights to women such as the right to vote and divorce. This did not please the status quo (aristocracy, landowners, military, Church) which organized a right wing coup d'etat lead by Generals including Franco. They failed to take over Barcelona but took other parts of Spain. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Barcelona was completely dominated by anarchist sindicates and people were sent to fight agaist Franco in the frontlines. this constituted the Spanish civil war that started in 1936 and ended in 1939 with victory of Franco (he had the support from Nazi Germany's powerful army and aviation and Mussolini's Italy whilst the left wing groups just had some support from the Soviet Union and volunteers from all over the world). \n\nThat's History, now the interesting parts. \nWomen fought in the trenches in the civil war and the first female minister from West was part of the leftist govt. \n\nKeep in mind, Barcelona was an industrial city where people worked 12-14h\/day, lived in completely inhumane conditions, and still did not make enough to live so sex work was widespread. In the short period Barcelona was dominated by anarchists, a movement called Mujeres libres, closed down all brothels in the city, executed the pimps and transformed the brothels in schools. I almost cried when the guide shared this.\n\nHowever the women who fought on the trenches also complained of harassment from their comrades.

I can actually see the last legs of the patriarchy starting to crumble: men are still stuck in their 'externalize' mode as if we live in the fucking jungle and there are tigers waiting to pounce us. They're all about what's 'out there' and have failed, immensely, to look inside themselves. When they manage to look inside, they produce philosophical works of bullshit that sound about as emotionally deep as the struggle of shitting out a hard turd.\n\nWhat the fuck even is this?\n\nIt's time for a system upgrade.

I've tried dating apps, meeting people in person, friends of friends, etc. I got my own apartment away from my home state and work a job that's unrelated to my career, although I've been applying for jobs in my field. I am active in FDS and after all the heartbreak and clowns ive dumped\/ rejected I decided to stay single between summer 2020 and the rest of 2020 at least. This is my opportunity for personal growth and development. \n\nIn my time reflecting, I've come to feel that most men are the same. I feel like if Id put myself out there that ill only end up being played, even with sticking to FDS strategies. I also know that men are biologically wired to reproduce as much as possible without being picky while women are wired to be more selective and get attached and develop feelings after having sex one time. \n\nI've been to therapy, journaled, spent time with family and friends as well as self caring and can say ive moved on and healed from my cheating ex. Every attempt at dating after him has resulted in guys that seem to get worse and worse. Lately, I've been getting hit on by some attractive men, but I politely turn them down. I can't handle it and don't know if I want to. \n\nBefore fds, I lived with guys or would stay with them on weekends sometimes and got that glimpse into what they are really like. The nicest, best candidates or so they seemed ended up faking everything and being looser slobs. Staying with them was like having a man toddler that was dirty, lazy, and had no respect. I think its hard to even find a man that has the bare minimum standards (my standards) of having a trade \/ college degree and can support himself, doesnt live with his parents, maintains his hygiene, knows basic cooking skills, and keeps his place at least reasonably clean. I couldnt even find candidates that could check off 3 or more of those.\n\nMarriage feels like a scam to me, I feel that a woman looses her identity to the man and turns into a mere extension of him. Youre no longer Samantha, the fun yoga loving accountant that paints in a studio on the side, but just \"toms wife\". I feel like the burden of the housework falls to you or you're expected to pay 50\/50 for the finances yet get stuck with way more to do in the housework and errands. All the women in unhappy marriages in my family tell me its about \"compromising\" but ive seen firsthand that always means they settle for what their husband wants, and when he does give in to help her or show up with her hes bored, embarassing, and such a hassle on purpose so he isn't asked again. When you do get him to finally hang those lights you've been asking for months, he half asses it and it doesn't even work right. It only creates more stress, frustration, and lost time for the wife. You could have done it yourself or hired someone to have it done right. You could have brought your sister to that farmers market and had fun rather than a complaining man child the whole time. What's the point? A roomate will go 50\/50 with you and you don't have to pick up for them. \n\nI have never wanted children either. I've helped taken care of my younger cousins and siblings my entire life, stepping up because my deadbeat dad wasn't around. my grandpa was my father figure and I held him in high esteem, but as an adult I saw hes racist, sexist, and made my grandma take the brunt of everything while she worked a full time job, had health issues, and was raising three kids. My moms friend is married and the dude has tried several times to actually hookup with my mom, trying to cheat on his wife. \n\nWhen i picture my future I imagine happiness as me traveling, running my career as a CPA, running my side business\/hobby, working out, and owning a 2 bedroom house. One room for me to sleep in and the other solely dedicated to my hobby business. I don't imagine a man, but I can see my sister living with me and us having a great time together. \n\nThe more I think about it the more I see relationships as a waste of time and they have proven to hurt me emotionally, financially, etc. I don't want kids and see marriage as a scam for women to be taken as a bangmaid majority of the time. Even dating feels like a waste of time and money, it takes me a solid hour to do my hair and makeup let alone walk in uncomfortable heels, and wear an expensive classy outfit it took me a while and a lot of money to build.... for what? Me driving 45 min to meet a guy for a $4 coffee?! \n\nLadies, how do you know its time to fully give up on dating and focus on yourself? When and how did you decide to become a WGTOW? I'm giving myself until the end of this year to grow more and see where my mindset is but every day I'm seeing myself more ready to be happily single forever.","title":"Hi Ladies I've been lurking and am thinking of going WGTOW?

I have read so many posts here and they totally resonate with me. So a little bit of background on myself. I'm 35 and knew pretty much since I was 13 that I was a lesbian. However I grew up in Ireland, a country that was hugely conservative and very backward when it came to LGBT.  Although my parents were always hugely supportive of the fact that I'm a lesbian, I still felt I had to put myself into the box of being straight to try to fit in (though I don't know why I even bothered). \n\nFrom my first relationship at the age of 16, I knew I hated being with men. Every relationship I had was abusive in some way. Every man I was with would insult how I looked, what I wore and pretty much wanted a carer or a mother instead of a partner. My self esteem became so low that I developed anorexia and body dysmorphia which I still have to a degree,  but it's not half as bad now. I tried to alter myself constantly with botox and fillers and was barely 27 when I was told I was 'getting on in age' . The last relationship I had with a man was someone who was quite a bit older than me. I never wanted children and he said he was glad because if I had them they would 'look like gremlins' . I hit a very low point after that relationship with depression.\n\nIt's only now that I'm really trying to heal from all of those relationships and trying to get my self esteem back. Sometimes I still feel very broken. All of that agist crap about 'hitting a wall' really did a number on my self esteem.  I internalised the cruel things that were said to me instead of listening to myself and my own opinion of myself.  I also heard scaremongering for a very long time about 'ending up alone' and I have come to the awareness that it would not be the worst thing in the world.  As long as I like myself and feel comfortable in my own skin (and I'm working on that), I will always have myself. I'm not sure if I fully qualify as WGTOW since in time I would like to have a female partner but I definitely know that I am going my own way from men. I no longer want anything to do with any of them even as friends since that has always ended very badly aswell. I am polite to the men I come across in my everyday life and I always will be, but that's as far as it will go. \n\nSo in a nutshell that's why I have decided to go my own way.

Incongruent and irreconcilable philosophies: \n\nThey cherry pick from tradwife and radical feminism to create a completely impossible syncretism between the two. On one hand, they rail against \"pick me's\", but then get upset if you criticize women. They expect a man to do all the providing and to contribute material largesse, they promote marriage as an end-goal for relationships with men, but say they're against the patriarchy. They claim to only be in the market for the creme de la creme, but most of them are using OLD all the time. \n\n2. Unrealistic expectations\/selling false hope: \n\nA majority of women are competing for a micro-minority of men who can be defined as \"high value\" according to the group standard. \n\nIf the methods are so effective, why are the same people there every day, week, month, even years? Where's the shiny unicorn they were strategizing so assiduously to capture?\n\n3. Cult-like Characteristics:\n\nA) In-group lexicon\nB)Myopic thinking\/our way is the only way\nC)Zero receptivity or tolerance for dissenting opinions, even on the most mundane details \nD) Power-tripping by those in higher positions within the hierarchy (a couple mods are reasonable, while others are drunk on some odd power high)\nE) Shaming anyone outside the group and the group's rigid behavioural code \n\nSee more information about identifying cultish groups on world renown cult-deprogrammer Rick Ross' website: https:\/\/culteducation.com\/warningsigns.html\n\n4. Lack of personal responsibility:\n\nAll blame is placed upon men, society, and women who don't conform to their ideology. There's little personal inventory-taking or recognition of their own unhealthy or selfish behavior.\n\nA prime example was a recent post by a young woman who wanted praise for dumping her \"toxic\" boyfriend for not accepting her desire for \"sexual adventure\", when in fact he was responding to her intent to become a prostitute. \n\n5. Promoting narcissistic and antisocial behavior. I.E. Replying to compliments from would-be suitors with \"yes I know I'm beautiful\", etc. No one wants to engage with someone who has that kind of ungracious attitude. There's a distinction between self-love, confidence, and being arrogant, conceited and rude. \n\nPositives: encouraging women to leave abusive relationships, criticizing the sex industry and hookup culture. However, overall, I think the corrosive aspects greatly outweigh the benefits and it'll probably take some time before adherents see the repercussions in their lives and relationships.","title":"The problem with FDS.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/j9v98a\/the_problem_with_fds\/"}

Thing is, they're very specific and they rule out almost everyone.\n\n- Religious requirement. \n\nI am an atheist, and I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't identify as an atheist. I know some people think that agnostic is similar, but my experience with agnostics is either that they don't care about the question or they are afraid of admitting they're atheists - at least religious people (while I don't agree with them) are firm about their beliefs.\n\n- Political requirement. \n\nI want someone who is on the left. I'm further to the left than most. I could not respect someone who didn't believe in things like abortion rights, or, someone who thought weed should be illegal. Or, someone who was anti gay rights. Or frankly, I couldn't respect someone who to some extent, didn't care about poor people - I believe the minimum wage should be higher and I support workers rights... I couldn't relate to someone who didn't agree with me on these things, we would be too different. We don't have to agree on everything, but I find these things rather basic as far as exploring political opinions. \n\n- Childfree\n\nI do not want kids and it's not something I can compromise on. I would never even accept a date from a man with children; it is my biggest deal breaker, I wouldn't even date someone who was open to having kids in case they were just being coy about actually wanting them. While it's not a deal breaker, I would prefer a man who was willing to get a vasectomy because it would demonstrate that he was committed to the lifestyle that I also want as far as children go, and sterilization is easier for men.\n\n- Fitness.\n\nI have a great body. And I am a visual creature. All of the guys I've dated have been jacked and went to the gym several times a week, except for the guy who swam competitively and was already lean\/muscular as a result. There is no f'ing way I'm not dating someone I'm not attracted to.\n\nThese are my absolute deal breakers. I wouldn't even consider someone who deviated from them. \n\nSo then, I decided to break it down today over my morning coffee. \n\nI am Canadian and I googled stats that were based on my country when I could.\n\n**What do the stats say?**\n\n- Atheist. \n\n*\"About three-in-ten Canadians say they are either atheist (8%), agnostic (5%) or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d (16%).\"*\n\nTo be honest, I only really want other atheists. I don't want to compromise on that. 8% if we're being strick, and 29% we're being generous. \n\n- Left Leaning. \n\nFor Canadian politics, I am NDP but I have voted liberal occasionally. NDP is left of liberal. For American context, in 2016 I would have voted for Bernie Sanders. I'd prefer someone NDP but I can see someone voting liberal. A joke here is that NDPs are just liberals in a hurry. I think it's fair to say that about half the country is left leaning. So we'll be generous here and say the number is exactly 50% (sometimes the conservative party does win, so I think it's fair to say that 50% of people lean right some of the time).\n\n- Childfree. \n\nMost polls done on voluntarily childlessness are targeted at women. Depending on the polls, men around the world who don't want kids range from 5-20%. About 60% of men over 18 do have kids, so they are an automatic no, but I also don't want to be in a relationship where he wants kids and I don't. So we'll say 5% if we're strict, and 20% if we're generous. \n\n- Fitness\n\nThere's no measurements online for guys with six packs or thick arms. There are stats on BMI, and it's atrocious. \n\n\"Public Health of Canada has reported that in 2017, 64% of Canadians over the age of 18 are overweight or obese\"\n\nOnly 35% of men are not overweight or obese in Canada. This is like the softest requirement - I'm just asking for someone who isn't fat! I haven't even gotten to the part where I want someone muscular, and I already have to exclude two thirds of all of them in the country. \n\n**Sloppy Math for strict scenario**\n\nSo, let's do some sloppy math. Realistically, some of these requirements are corelated with each other, or even inversely corelated. But I'm not a statistician and I don't have access to the info that would make this more accurate. So we're just going to basic math and see what percentage of these things overlap with each other without regard for how they may corelate with each other. \n\nUsing strict numbers: \n\n- 8% of men are atheists. Half of men are left leaning. 50% of 8% is 4%. Only 4% of men are both atheist and left leaning.\n- 4% of men are (atheist+left leaning). 5% of men don't want kids. 5% of 4% is 0.2%. Only 0.2% of men are (atheist+left leaning) and don't want kids. \n- 0.2% of men are atheist+left leaning+childfree. Only 36% of men in Canada are not fat. 36% of 0.2% is 0.072%. \n\nSo, using the strictest\/simplest of sloppy math, 0.072% of men fit 4 requirements. \n\n**Being generous about the numbers.**\n\nAssume I actually consider non-religious men instead of strictly atheists. That broadens my numbers from 8% atheists to 29% non-religious. Quite a difference. And say, assume that 20% of men do not want kids, as opposed 5%. Again, quite a difference. Let's repeat the same sloppy math but with numbers that broaden my dating pool.\n\n- 29% of men are non-religious. 50% of men are left leaning. 50% of 29% is 14.5%. \n- 14.5% of men are non-religious and left leaning. 20% of men prefer not to have kids. 20% of 14.5% is 2.9%. \n- 2.9% of men are non-religious and left leaning and prefer not to have kids. Only 36% of men in Canada are not fat. 36% of 2.9% is 1.044%\n\nEven in the best case scenario where I give a generous interpretation to what I will accept as to fitting my standards, only 1% of men fit the descriptions I want.\n\nWhat I really want is a man who identifies as an atheist, is positive about not want kids, is muscular, and agrees with me on key political issues and sides on the left. But I can't filter for men who are muscular with these statistics - granted, I also can't account for some overall - for example, men who are not religious, are less likely to want kids. That increases the odds that more men who fit my description exist.\n\nBut these are only 4 fucking requirements!!\n\nThere are still LOADS MORE THAT I CAN'T GOOGLE BASIC STATS of.\n\n- Is he a gentleman?\n\n- Is he basically kind?\n\n- Is he funny, does he make me laugh?\n\n- Does he care about making me happy?\n\n- Is my life better with him in it?\n\n- Is he cool with me having 2+ dogs at all times? Absolute dealer if no.\n\n- Do we share the same views on marriage?\n\n- Is he an adult who can take care of himself?\n\n- Is he attractive? Is he smart?\n\n- Does he make a certain amount of money? (preferably, more than I do)\n\n- Is he educated? Not a requirement, but definitely a strong preference.\n\n- Is he tall? Again, not a requirement - I'm short and I've been happy dating short guys, but I won't pretend for a second that taller men aren't more desirable even when you don't have a strict minimum limit. \n\nAnd then, after all of these considerations, how likely is it that he will be attracted to me, and that I will fit the requirements that he's looking for in a woman? \n\nRealistically I'd have to meet thousands to even find someone who fit the 4 basic requirements. \n\nAnd here's a personal requirement for myself: \n\nI don't like dating apps, so I won't ever even be able to instantaneously apply these filters across thousands of men looking for a relationship. \n\nSo...\n\nI think I'm just done with men... I don't think putting the time into making myself attractive, or to appear available. Like, once I really took a look at my standards and internalized that I can't compromise on them, and then googled how likely I am to find someone who meets those requirements, dating just seems impossssssssible. \n\nI think I'm truly going to throw in the towel and declare that I'll be single forever. I think from this point forward I just have to live with the reality that time spent on men or dating is just time that's wasted - it's not likely to work in my favour, so why bother putting in the effort?","title":"Statistical proof I will be single forever.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/jpwt4j\/statistical_proof_i_will_be_single_forever\/"}

We dated back in 2017. It was a short lived relationship, but it was also my first relationship ever and I lost my virginity to him. He broke up with me due to some personal issues, and it literally shattered me. His last words to me (or text message, to be exact) was that he\u2019s sorry for ignoring me (for one of the months that we were together) and that he hopes I find someone better. I was a naive young girl then, but I understood that he wasn\u2019t well. It took a painful few months, but I eventually healed. \n\nFast forward to 2021-\nHe texts me out of the blue at 12am last Saturday (I was surprised to see his name pop up, I thought he would\u2019ve blocked me) :\n\u201cHappy new year :) How\u2019ve you been?\u201d \n\nWe then message back and forth a little and then he tells me the exact same thing he told me 3.5 years ago: \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I hope you find someone better\u201d. \n\nWhat on earth was the point of him reaching out to me years later, just to tell me the exact same thing he said years ago? I took it as a harmless\/kind gesture and I thanked him politely for reaching out to me, and that was that. Maybe I\u2019m crazy, but I mean what ex messages you years later without an ulterior motive?\n\nNow, I\u2019m a heavy thinker and I get sentimental when thinking about the past. Flashbacks of certain memories (me having sex for the first time) have resurfaced and now I\u2019m wasting precious energy just thinking about the past. The feelings of hurt, anger, loss of appetite and worthlessness are rubbing on me again. Now I find myself thinking about him and desiring him all over again. All over a simple text he sent that didn\u2019t need to be sent. It\u2019ll take me a few days\/weeks to recover again, but I know that I\u2019m strong.\n\nLadies, we are on a forward trajectory, and the last thing we need is to be pulled unexpectedly back into our past because of a man.

A male cop knocked at my door. I only answer when I'm expecting the mailman or something. I thought this knock was the pizza being a little early. It was a cop asking to come IN my apartment and saying someone (who had a warrant out, and I don't even know this person) used my address and they were looking for said person. He made me show him ID and then made a sexist comment. He gave me a really bad vibe, and ive been around cops before and had a similar cop knock at a previous apartment, but today this one rubbed me the wrong way. He also treated me like a liar and a criminal. Luckily he left but honestly I'm worried he will be around again. \n\nI've been looking for a new place for about a month but eased off seeing the area im at is shutting down again and jobs are cutting hours.

There'll be a small bathroom and some vending machines. This will be an ideal area to socialize or be loud without having people actually come to your room or disturb the rest of the people. There will then be a 2nd locked door that leads to the hallway with all the rooms. Theyll be modest sized 1 bedroom apartments. The community will be well maintained, maintenence workers that are hired will be female, and the community will be affordable.

You can't show up at the bank to pay your bills with love,doctors save strangers lives all the time and they dont love those people and parents are legally obligated to care for their children whether they love them or not.\n\n In terms of romantic love it seems to be a very weak factor in whether someone is actually treated well in a relationship. Men exclaim up and down that they love their partners but will still beat,steal,lie and deceive them despite what they say. And sometimes the woman will say its okay because their partner claims they love them (though they say this because they are being lied to not by just the man but people in their life saying that they need that man)\n\n I have been fortunate enough to have mentors in my life that have guided me and have been pivotal in my development but thats because they are good people,if I asked them I highly doubt they would say its because they loved me. They would probably say its because they hold their position of being a mentor in high esteem and have a standard they want to meet and that I also met the standard of being a worthy mentee so thats why they mentored me. Love might be the 10th reason out of a list of 10 and could even be seen as inappropriate (even if they said they saw me as a daughter they have their own kids so I can still see that as crossing a line) It felt great to be seen as having a lot of potential,but feeling loved never crossed my mind. I feel like being liked is a lot more important,you get fucked over a lot less when people like you. Maybe I'm too ambition pilled. \n\nI was just wondering what other peoples thoughts were on this as I recognize that I'm limited by the scope of my own experiences and I'm also on the aromantic spectrum so emotionally I am distant from the experience of love as well.","title":"The function of love","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/16jm6uk\/the_function_of_love\/"}

I was working home and didn't go out in almost a year so really needed the socialization. Also I am in Europe and my country is extremely safe so I wouldn't say it is dangerous here to stsy in hostel but I am not sure the same can be said about other countries. \n\nI met some amazing people, most were girls and a few men. From what I observed, a lot of men who lead the hostel\/travelling lifestyle only like to party, do drugs and look for hookups with hot women. The most interesting men were already grandads so that tells you something (I couldn't feel any sexual attraction, they were just interesting as people). From young guys in my age range I only liked two honestly, and guys do tend to be the majority in those places. Most of them just try to get the number\/instagram\/facebook of all the girls they can chat with. I met one who was so pushy, no surprise he has some arab or indian ancestry. \n\nI met a catholic girl who was friends with atheists and was super nice, yet had two of those so called super progressive men who like to do drugs saying that people who don't do it are boring and are missing out on life. So apparently it seems in these circles the \"progressives\" are more prejudiced than religious people. Also its usually guys who are obsessed with drinking, weed and hashish. \n\nOn one place I stayed there was a girl who had a big personality, one of those that doesn't tolerate BS. There was also another girl who was one of those conventionally hot blondes and another one who was 20 and oh boy she absolutely needed male validation. She tried to please and be nice to all men. \n\nI had a crush with one of the guys from this place last year (before I even knew about wgtow concept), invited him out and he turned me down, said he was busy. I decided to come back this year to the same place despite this because I liked it, I had met great people there last year. This year the owners of the place were also there helping him out and they had volunteer girls (amazing girls too). The owners I did not like at all, they are from my country and I could sense some of the typical macho BS you find in guys here. The guy who I had a crush on seemed different (different country), absolutely loves the owners, he works there for free basically and is friends with them. \n\nAnyway in one instance all the owners and this guy were flirting with the blonde girl I mentioned. It was late so the owners said they'd close the garden to avoid noise but when I was going to bed I saw them come down to have drinks with this girl. So other people couldn't stay but they could. They also laughed at the girl who I mentioned had a big personality because she said she washed their clothes that were in the washing machine because she wanted to use it (which was their job to wash the stuff they had on the machine and since they didn't do it, she did it herself). This girl was on the obese side so I could sense they sort of despised her. Btw she was obese because she had cancer recently and her chemo drugs made her gain weight, before of that she was skinny.\n\nI didn't like the blonde girl I thought she was too stood up so next day I chatted with her to see if I was right. Turns out she is super smart, even works in the IT field, has opinions about political issues, has had previous experiences with abusive relationship, she was great. I felt bad that I had felt jealous or envious of her the previous day. And for what? Clearly even if she dates on of those guys including my former crush, she is not gaining a lot. Guys who spend all the time drinking, smoking and who'll flirt with the newest hot woman that arrives. I don't even know what I was thinking when I had this crush, I guess I often think men are more complex and have deeper emotions then they actually are. Most of the times they are just basic sad creatures who just want sex and no commitement. \n\nI met three other girls who were super beautiful and stylish. They had the sweetest personality ever, I went on day trips and kept in touch with two of them.\n\nI guess the bottom line here is often women envy each other because they see other women as competition or as a threat. This is all a patriarchal construct. I wish I could erase this flaw from my personality of comparing myself to other women and sometimes feeling jealous if they are prettier than me. I found I still have it too engrained on me and feel a bit disappointed I still didn't fully move on from that relationship oriented mentality.\n\nGuess this turned into sort of a vent.","title":"Lessons from solo vacation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/os1swr\/lessons_from_solo_vacation\/"}

In the eyes of society it is incomprehensible that a woman would prefer a life to herself instead of sharing it with a man. We are expected to find a man otherwise we cannot simply be happy. Not even widows are safe from this and are pressured to start dating the instant our spouse is gone.  It's disgusting and this is why WGTOW is needed, because women like us need to be freed from these pressures. \n\nWe have chosen to live our life without men because men in general are disgusting and cannot be trusted anymore, not with this pornsick society that's all about catering to their depravity. Women cannot even find a partner who will give up watching and supporting that sickness. Just see subs like LoveAfterPorn if you really want to know how bad things are. And I don't see it changing any time soon, so the only sure fire way to avoid any of this is to avoid all men. We can be happy alone because only then are we free to truly be ourselves and live the life that we want to.  Men are threatened by this because THEY are the ones who are afraid of being alone.\n\nThat is why they use being alone as a way to threaten us, because its really them that's afraid. They're more dependent on women than women are on them. They also HATE when women have standards because they know they cannot live up to them no matter what. They might pretend but in the end the truth comes out. That's another thing important to realize, men are so desperate to not be alone they will pretend to be something they are not just to avoid it.\n\nWhen we choose to be alone we're not pretending or fooling ourselves. It's a simple choice we have made and its one we choose to stand by. There's no fake it till you make it, because there's nothing but genuine bliss having the peace and comfort of just having to worry about ourselves and our own needs. I recall seeing a statistic where it showed how married women are more unhappy than unmarried women. That was very eye opening and this is because the majority of marriages are unsatisfying for women because women are the ones doing most if not ALL the work, and still being expected to cater to the needs of men. Married women also die earlier than unmarried women. That was something else I noticed in the same statistic. \n\nThat's because marriage in a lot of cases is slavery disguised as \"happiness\" and what woman doesn't want to spend all day on her hands and knees scrubbing the floors and then expected to get on those same hands and knees and suck her husband's dick to keep him happy so he doesn't cheat or leave her?  And why is that? OH right, because of the fear of being alone again.\n\nWe've all heard it, from family to friends and of course internet strangers (mostly men) trying to instill the fear of god in us, because how dare we want a real life of happiness where the only person we have to worry about is our self.\/s Well enough of that I say, stop living in fear and start looking forward to it. And remember, it's mostly the men who are the most afraid of being alone because they depend on us more than we depend on them.","title":"Something important to remember","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/jxu8yc\/something_important_to_remember\/"}

All of the men who want to take me out only want to fuck me. They don\u2019t want anything long-term with me.

I've lurked here and there but for the most part have stayed away from reddit and similar spaces like this. There are a few reasons why - part of it was trauma I experienced that had to do with reddit itself but it was also that I felt in order to deprogram I actually had to get away from places that reminded me I was deprogramming lol. I honestly think that's part of why this sub stays small and people come in and out because we are really out here living our lives. And I've been living mine!\n\nI've done so much growth in the past year. I have tried things I never thought I'd be good at, created new adventures and experiences for myself, and have a new outlook. I have deep delved into the work I needed to do that was often painful and I still have some of those feelings but that's okay. \n\nI've changed my flair from 'deprogramming' to 'deprogrammed' because even though I still feel I have more work to do I know for a fact I have fundamentally, permanently changed the way I view myself, men, and the patriarchal society we live in. I no longer have rose colored glasses and truly believe I see the world for what it is. The wgtow path is the path for me. I am no longer embracing this out of a 'need' but because out of all my studying, introspection, and deprogamming it is something I GENUINELY want to do and I know is right for me. There is a depth to myself and my person that I didn't have a year ago. \n\nI read a quote a while back it might have been on here that mentioned something like your self image getting sharper and more focused, and viewing yourself as the precious human being as you are and I really feel that.\n\nNot to say that it's been perfect, I definitely feel like I could have done more, I still have more to do, but the pain that I was in has greatly, drastically subsided.

I've been a lurker for a while on this sub, and it's been great finding other like-minded women.\n\nI started turning my life around in my early twenties, getting my shit together in various ways. From age 25-28 I went celibate because I needed to focus on myself and get away from the exhaustion of chasing male validation, since I, like many, learned that chasing relationships was the purpose of life. Taking those years off to just focus on myself and my friends was the most liberating experience of my entire life! I learned so much about myself. My self-esteem and self-worth skyrocketed! I've never been so happy as I was during that time, just breezing through existence solo, doing whatever the hell I wanted.\n\nThen I met someone when I was 28. We entered a relationship that went from an open one (I'm a relationship anarchist and he claimed to be poly) and things were good! I truly enjoyed doing my own thing and seeing this guy whenever. There were so many red flags I ignored, however. One being his pathological lying about weird, insignificant things. Him suddenly wanting to be monogamous (and later confessed he was cheating after I reluctantly agreed to being mono). Couples counseling. His narcissism cracking through the mask. Porn-sickness, sex-addiction, workaholism. Manipulation, man-child behavior, suicid4l threats, sociopathy and during the last year I basically turned into his mother. He was the whole package of awful. It was so stressful that my period got weird AF for many months, my skin was a mess and I developed severe anxiety. It was a mess and after 4 years of the most stressful relation I've ever had, I called it quits and went no contact. That's almost 5 months ago.\n\nBreaking it off is the best thing I've ever done! And after the initial trauma-bond hell-scape of breaking up, I find myself so fvcking happy that I'm just back to being solo. My body is back to normal. I no longer have anxiety. My skin has cleared up and weight stabilized. I have more energy to pursue my hobbies again and I don't have to be the emotional punching back for an un-treated cluster-B sociopath (not trying to bash cluster-B personalities, but he didn't get the help he so desperately needed).\n\nI'm living alone for the first time ever (always lived with family or him) and everything is just amazingly peaceful again. I'm getting more convinced that solo life is just the way to go for me. I have absolutely zero desire to date or hook up (I never cared for casual sex to begin with) and I'm so glad to be back to my abstinent ways. I have no more time for dysfunctional dick, haha.\n\nI've basically given up on the idea of a man who is actually an ally to women, who is not a lowkey misogynistic predatory borderline-pedo creep, without a myriad of psychological issues.\n\nWhat saddens me, though, is I have no real life friends who truly understand me.\n\nPeople keep pestering me about dating and that I \"need to get laid\". People keep pestering me about my biological clock ticking (I am childfree and will never have kids because no thanks). No one seems to understand that happiness and love can be achieved on your own. No one seems to understand that not everyone centers their life around dick. No one seems to understand that maybe my ideal life is sitting in a cabin with a handful of animals just doing my craft, minding my own business.\n\nWhere are all the WGTOW in real life?!\n\nNext weekend I'm going on a family trip with the entire family. I haven't seen them all in more than 2 years and I am absolutely dreading all the bingos about men, children, relationships and what not. I'm just so over explaining my choices in life. They have always bingo'd me about EVERYTHING. I already live a very untraditional life with an untraditional job and untraditional diet, all things they've pestered me about for years, and I just can't deal with their crap anymore.\n\nAnyway, I just wish I knew and had WGTOW friends in real life.

I'd rather spend my time raising my son to respect women than spend the rest of my life bitching with miserable banshees\".\n\nThe same boymom said she think she can \"mold\" her son. The word is actually quite telling. It made me think of the story of Pygmalion\n\n *Pygmalion, disgusted by the loose and shameful lives of the women of his era, decides to live alone and unmarried. With wondrous art, he creates a beautiful statue more perfect than any living woman.*  \n *The more he looks upon her, the more deeply he falls in love with her, until he wishes that she were more than a statue.*    \n\n\nThe statue that he molded as his perfect women (in traits and in personality) then becomes real.  \nI think that women who are disapointed by the state of men and want to raise their sons into their idea of a man who respects women and as some sort of ideal romantic partner aren't as different as Marquis de Sade rewriting Pygmalion but with his daughter.  \nNot that these women are as degenrate as Sade, or more recently, incels who want to groom their daughters into becoming sex slaves. But the instrumantalization of children and the incesty element is there. I definitely think adults project their fantasies onto children. (Which is why I am a firm believer it's okay to disapoint your parents lol.)  \nTerri Strange has an excellent video abt mothers of sons where she says mothers have a romantic attachement to their sons, and she cited the exemple of Amy Schumen who was shocked she got along with her mother in law bc she always felt like she was treated as a sexual competition by the mothers of her former boyfriends.  \nI understand that patriarchy creates this structure where women feel their role in a man's life (mother, wife or girlfriend) is their entire identity.

I am 21 and none of my friends really think through this lens, so it has been nice reading it all in one online space.\n\nI have great men in my life who believe in equality and are respectful towards women (if anything I haven\u2019t met a necessarily \u201cbad\u201d man in my life), but they all still have underlying sexism even if they are just small ideas like: women are more emotional or a girl showing more skin is promiscuous or women are worse at sports and the scary thing is they don\u2019t even realize their sexism.\n\nIt\u2019s so weird to me. Every guy I\u2019ve met has ideas like this.\n\nAnyways... recently I have been hitting my breaking point where the traumas I take in from around the world due to the patriarchy\/sexism and the every day small sexist things that still occur to this day, has ended up manifesting itself into not only emotional pain, but also physical pain like heightened anxiety, blood pressure and panic attacks. I thought I was just being weak, but now I realize I\u2019m not and that it is so relevant and valid after I found this sub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe take in hurtful stories about women all of our lives that it becomes so normalized. We are socially conditioned as women to fit into femininity, which at the end of the day femininity is mostly all in accordance to men anyways, as if our mere existence is built for men. It is so degrading once I really thought about it. We take in the little sexist remarks upon little sexist remarks all throughout life. All of these things would not even be a thing if it wasn\u2019t due to underlying sexism towards women and it has finally broke me to where my well being is anything, but well.\n\nIt just saddens me how normal it is for women to have their lives destroyed due to sexism, but how still even at that, a lot of men still lack the empathy to really care and actively try to educate themselves. It is just all so twisted and gets to me, especially since a lot of women educate and pursue careers where they are fixing men's systemic issues or emotional issues and it is not evenly reciprocated. There should be so many more male social workers, male teachers, male activists for women\u2019s issues, male therapists, males starting more organizations for their gendered issues etc.\n\nIt is just so disgusting how normalized it is for women to be oppressed in literally every system of life. Men obviously have oppression's as well and ironically a lot of them are due to the patriarchy. The issue is that the reasoning behind oppression against us as women majority of the time is due to sexism from men. Men aren\u2019t being killed due to sexist ideas towards women. Men aren\u2019t being raped on a large scale due to sexist ideas from women. Men aren\u2019t objectified and overly sexualized in the media due to sexist ideas from women. Men aren\u2019t developing eating disorders, body dysmorphia, mental illnesses or killing themselves over not fitting into the ideal image of what the U.S. male society deems is the perfect woman physically and what capitalism feeds to women through the plastic surgery industry, the cosmetics industry, the fashion industry, and marketing on a large scale as to how we can fit this perfect image of what a woman should look like in our day and age in accordance to men. The aborting of male babies due to their gender isn't a common issue like femicide is. Women aren't human trafficking men on a large scale to have sex with them. I could go on and on.\n\nI have literally just hit my breaking point. The tiny micro aggression's towards women add up to be huge oppression's against women and it hurts me so much that it has affected every woman in my life in some way, you guys on here, and probably majority of women that I see just passing down the street.\n\nI also thought my own generation was getting better since we are more progressive, but when I see the large scale ideas against women or tiny micro aggression's against women especially on social media from people my age (like \u201ci\u2019m never having a daughter\u201d, the whole \u201csimp\u201d thing, the general slut shaming, \u201cyou belong to the streets\u201d etc;) I think to myself, maybe not. (don\u2019t get me started on how normalized degrading porn is for my generation and the thing is a relatively \u201cgood and empathetic guy\u201d could be watching it, because it is so normalized.)\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest and use this as my validation to follow my truth and what feels right to me in this one life I have. Anyways, if you read this, thanks for listening to a random stranger on the internet.","title":"I feel so much less alone and validated after finding this sub, so here is a long rant I simply need to get off my chest.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/h99vvq\/i_feel_so_much_less_alone_and_validated_after\/"}

I had been hooking up with a nerdy guy that our mutual friend had introduced me to (he was really into sci fi, video games, larping, etc.) and I wound up getting pregnant. Although I wasn't super into the guy initially, he seemed pretty nice and he wanted to stick around and be a dad. He grew on me and we got married about 4 months before our daughter was born. \n\nThings started going badly even before we got married. Had I not been pregnant I doubt I would have gone through with it. He had a lot of trouble holding down a job. He spent all day playing video games while I worked two jobs as a security guard and cleaning rooms at a motel, often having to throw up in the trash can at work because of bad morning sickness. \n\nThings got continually worse after we got married. He just refused to pull his weight. Refused to help with the baby, and was consistently unemployed or underemployed. He cheated on me on more than one occasion. I left him on several occasions, but he always cried and begged me to take him back with promises of things getting better. \n\nEventually when our daughter was 4 I left him for good. I didn't want anything from him. We split custody as close to 50\/50 as possible and I let him keep the car, the apartment, and everything in the home except for my clothes and half of my daughter's clothes. I started over completely. \n\nWhen our daughter was 7 he remarried. I remarried when she was 12 to a nice stable guy with a strong work ethic. The ex and I got along alright, even though he would occasionally make plans for vacations during my custody time without asking me. We always worked it out without going to court and he grudgingly started to respect my scheduled time. I became good friends with his second wife, and we all spent time together as a family. She had a baby girl when my daughter was 14. \n\nWhen my daughter was 15 she started having serious mental health issues. I had her hospitalized, which she was extremely grateful for, and she started taking antipsychotics which helped immensely. She has serious mental illness on both sides of her family so I assumed it was just genetic. Her dad tried to swing his dick around again, and told her that when she came back to his house he was taking her off the meds. She cried and told him he had no idea what it was like to hear violent mean voices all the time. He started yelling at her so loud that I could hear him over the phone from across the room. I told her to hang up and she did. He tried to call her phone and my phone each at least a dozen times. The next day I sent him a short email saying that she needs his empathy and support right now, not his tinfoil hat bullshit. He apologized and said that he had talked to his wife about it and she agreed with me. \n\nWhen she was 16 she started to become more and more withdrawn and seemed bothered and preoccupied. She was still doing poorly in school. I asked her what was going on, and after some amount of prodding she told me she had been sexually abused. By her father. \n\nI spoke with a counselor at the rape crisis center. And we reported it to the police. They obtained a warrant to record phone calls and all forms of electronic communication, and my daughter called him and confronted him over what he had done. He admitted everything and deperately tried to convince her to keep it a secret. He was indicted, arrested, and after a year and a half his attorney convinced him to plead out. He will be in prison through his mid 60's and is not allowed to contact me or my daughter again. His second wife divorced him and moved across the country with their daughter. She now has another female single mom as a roommate and doesn't have much interest in dating. \n\nI was married to my second husband for 6 years. Unlike my first husband he is a relatively decent human being. But his interest in sex dropped off sharply after the first year. We spent thousands on sex therapy. He insisted that there was no reason for it and nothing that I was doing wrong. Nothing improved. I finally told him that I wanted a divorce. A couple days after that he finally admitted that the reason he had no sex drive was that he had a bdsm fetish and that he is a masochist. I tried out being a \"domme\" a few times but I hated it. I told him that he deserved to be with someone sexually compatible and so did I. We amicably parted ways, and split everything 50\/50. He and I are still friends, but I have zero regrets and I felt much more free and happy after leaving. I realized how much he had been holding me back and how much extra work he had created for me. \n\nI had just turned 39 when we split up. Dating was a shit show. Most men my age had not held up well or taken care of themselves. I mostly went out with younger men in their early 30's, but it was one man-child after another. One day, after being stood up for a first date by a guy who had texted to confirm with me that morning (I believe because I would not commit to having sex with him on the first date), I decided that I was fucking done with men. \n\nI switched all of my apps to look for women only. I had never seriously dated a woman before and had only a small handful of sexual experiences with them, mostly as part of a threesome with my first husband (before I got pregnant). I had been aware of a mild attraction to women since my pre-teens but I always believed and internalized that 1) women are crazy, irrational and unstable 2) women are much harder to \"get\" 3) that lesbians would not be interested in me because I had been with men before and 4) that lesbian sex is less pleasurable. All of these things turned out to be completely false. If you are even remotely assertive and willing to make the first few moves, it's not at all difficult to find women to date. And the sex is so much better that it's not even comparable. The experience of dating women was so refreshing compared to dating men. Even if they weren't interested they treated me like a human being and were kind and caring about it. And if I wasn't interested they took the L with grace. After a month I found my girlfriend on Tinder and we have now lived together for a year. \n\nWhile obviously no relationship is perfect, the difference is like night and day. I'm so much happier. I feel appreciated. I feel supported. She does a lot of housework and I don't have to ask her to. Her sexual attraction to me is just as strong as it was at the beginning. She is loyal and kind. She loves my friends and they are all friends with her too now. My daughter loves her too.  I couldn't ask for a better partner. \n\nMy advice to any of you who have been struggling with lonliness and wanting a partner: if you have any hint of bisexuality or bicurousness, give it a shot. I used to never believe that I could have a full on relationship with a woman, but I now believe that that was just a reaction to heteronormative culture and internalized misogyny. Once I met a girl I was compatible with it was like a switch got flipped in me and now I could never go back to dating, having sex with, or having relationships with men.","title":"How I got here","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/efkwnq\/how_i_got_here\/"}

I failed a year and had to repeat it. Every summer, I had to fly back and retake exams. It sucked.\n\nI graduated medical school 2 years ago and had been using that time to take my board exams. The first part I passed, but barely (this was in January). Then I got extremely distracted\/consumed by a potential relationship that did not work out.

Caring for ourselves is important for health reasons both physical health and mental health. In terms of mental health caring about us is important to have a good self esteem, but is it really necessary or is it because in those cases the self esteem is determined by how others (particularly men and potential romantic partners) perceive us? What if someone doesn't care about that and their self esteem is linked to other factors? \n\nPersonally I was always obsessed about looks because I was bullied because of it. When I was younger my dream was to get money to do expensive beauty treatments. As I grew older that stopped being a priority but I still have some anxiety about it specially about weight. \n\nI guess what I am trying to understand is what is the cause for women being so obsessed about their looks. Is it to get male validation? Is it to get validation from other women and society in general and belong to a group? Or is purely for oneself? I guess if its the first option if you stop dating, you'd stop caring.

They will do what they can to get rid of you eg abuse you and maybe even kill you. \n\nStay away from men forever. Get an IUD or tubal ligation.","title":"American Murder: Family Next Door","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/j2kov9\/american_murder_family_next_door\/"}

I used to be a conformist girl who wanted to look good for the boys. I grew up watching Disney cartoons and wanted to have a fairy tale wedding with horses and princesses and princes. \n\nThen I learned that fantasy is fantasy. Men are not as honorable as depicted in fairy tales.\n\nAfter wasting so much time, effort, and money trying to attract men, I suddenly learned about WGTOW and have since kept my interactions with men to a minimum. I still interact with men at work, and I still interact with male family members, but I keep it short, polite, and to a minimum.\n\nWithout the constant anxiety of appeasing men and conforming to society, I'm able to just do what I want to do, which has resulted in more freedom, greater peace in my life, and extra money as well.\n\nHowever, after turning WGTOW, I learned more and more about men's natural rape instinct and aggression. Men are naturally keen to dominate and oppress others. \n\nLife started to get difficult for me because many of my fellow women were phallocentric conformists who were keen to appease men. Many of these women constantly attempted to put me down or disgrace me for not having a boyfriend or not marrying, so I needed to work extra hard to minimize contact with these women as well.\n\nMany of these phallocentric women are housewives now, and they constantly complain to me about their husbands, but of course because they are married and look after children, they are financially dependent on their husbands, so they are trapped. \n\nSome of these conformist women are not housewives because they work. Mainly because of high property prices, both the man and woman need to work in order to pay the mortgage, and the child is put into childcare, which is very expensive. It seems like if you have a family you need to buy a large house, which means you must borrow more, which means you have a higher debt burden, which greatly enslaves you to the bank. If you were single, you'd only need a one-bedroom apartment, which will be cheaper to rent or buy (and maintain) compared to a large house. There is a reason why the word \"mortgage\" is French for \"death agreement.\"\n\nBeing alone is not as bad as society tries to tell you it is. One of the benefits is that you shield yourself from the madness of the world. People in general (men and women) annoy me, and you only need to turn on the TV or browse the internet to see that all the torture, pain, and slaughter in the world, so going your own way is great because although you may not be able to control the world, you can control your own world. \n\nThe madness of the world often gets to me. With all the oppression, torture, and slavery, I sometimes wonder whether humans are fundamentally evil. Are humans simply inherently oppressive? \n\nNevertheless, the most painless and non-violent manner to address this, in my opinion, is antinatalism. I don't know if I want to bring an innocent child into such a corrupt and depraved world. \n\nBy not breeding, not only am I sparing a child from suffering and pain, but I am also liberating myself from the duty to pay for the child, which results in extra freedom and wealth. \n\nPeople say that not breeding goes against nature, but they cannot deny that human population explosion is destroying nature.","title":"Any WGTOWs Here Antinatalist?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/6xsony\/any_wgtows_here_antinatalist\/"}

At first, other women didn't help her out of fear but after a while they all started going to her house help her out.

I'm tired of talking to a guy a while, calling on the phone, thinking he seems great, and even having a great first date and then the second date is lazy and he all of a sudden tells me \"its your turn to buy\".

It keeps you from doing your work.\"\n\nMisogyny kinda works the same way. Women constantly have to prove their worth while simultaneously navigating a system that wasn't meant for our benefit.   \nThe thing with people(men and women alike) who look down on you because you have a vagina is, you're going to waste time trying to prove them you're worthy of respect, consideration but it's so futile. Their entire identity is based on the fact they they're \"better\" so they won't recognize your humanity\/intellect\/whatever.\n\n\"It keeps you explaining over and over your reason for being \\[...\\]None of this is necessary there will always be one more thing.\"\n\nI was listening to that podcast from the creator of a website called \"women love power\" who was saying how hard it is to listen to your inner voice because 1) it takes a lot of courage 2)it takes a certain amount of calm and relaxation and society makes it a point to keep us in a very anxious state.   \nAnd last but not least, EVERYONE wants to tell you who you are. Misogynists especially.\n\nAt the end of the day, I could say I cured cancer and misogynists will go \"so what you cured cancer? Is this supposed to be some type of accomplishment??\". They will always try to belittle you, so don't waste your time trying to prove them wrong, stay aligned with your purpose, whatever the fuck it is.","title":"What Toni Morrison says about racism also applies to misogyny as well","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/ixvz3q\/what_toni_morrison_says_about_racism_also_applies\/"}

It's honestly amazing how men's voices, and beings seem to expand to fill any given space. How entitled to overwriting us they are, how they expect us to make ourselves fluid and yielding to them, to flow around them and only ever fill in the gaps they allow us. How we are left with the scraps of our own voices, lost to the radio static they try to erase us with, so that we sound distorted and alien even to ourselves.\n\nAnd how inevitably, as soon as you have a handful of men in any given situation, everything ends up being a dick measuring competition. Men have so much power and yet they are still so power hungry!! Like the hungry ghosts of Buddhist philosophy, they take and take and take and are still never satisfied. \n\nSo I've recently been purging men from my life, I'll be polite and cordial, but I won't engage them. I don't invite them to things.\n\nI had my first women's only dinner party with the girls from my main friendship group and some others, and the dynamic was amazing. I got to experience these fabulous women as they truly are, the true forms of their characters and souls that can only be known when men are not there to crush them and bend the pliant remains into false shapes. \n\nGroup spaces that involve men turn into battles waged on the psychological\/emotional and social front, each one trying to carry the most weight and take up the most space. Female only group spaces feel like beautiful, flowing tapestries, communally woven from our individual threads to create something overwhelming, unique and united. \n\n\nSo yeah. I need more women only spaces in my life. I know of a women's only gym, which is the only type I will go to now. I believe one of my local pools may have women's only swim hours in the schedule. \n\nBut I want more than that, I want women's only book groups, and networking events, I want women's only film nights, and women's only clubs. \n\n\nThe fewer men I have to put up with in life, the happier I am. :)","title":"I need more Women only spaces.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/6vrxdt\/i_need_more_women_only_spaces\/"}

Since pandemic I work remotely so spend a lot of time in my hometown where nothing happens. It can be boring but also sometimes the silence and the abundant space is good. Anyway my dog is there and I can't yet afford a place for myself much less with space for him. \n\nI still rent in the city and even though now I don't have to go to the office often I made a point of keeping the rental to come here once in a while and do social stuff. But last year I had to move to a new place and it was fine but in Sept new people entered and I swear I never had so many problems in 6 years of house sharing as I did in 6 months and before I used to be in the city full time now I am just like one week per month if that much...These girls have issues. You go around the city and see increasing numbers of homeless people but these people make huge big ass dramas about tiny hairs in the bathtub among other things, which is like wtf how old are you. \n\nLast year I finally landed the position at work I was looking for a while but my dog died abruptly around the time I started so I didn't even have reason to celebrate. I feel extreme guilt for her death ever since and because of that I am afraid to leave my other dog and come to the city so since then the joy of coming here faded a bit and with all this pseudodramas its even worst. \n\nI had a friend but he became too toxic with his victim actitude and I had to cut contact. I have another friend but we had a fight before and I always feel she only wants to meet to discuss her problems and doesn't care about mine. Anyway at least she doesn't obsessively speak about relationships which is good. I have some other friends who are all partnered up, with kids or planning to. So yeah around that time of life where your social cycle shrinks. \n\nAt work I thought I finally had reached some stability and was finally saving to buy a house, but now the sector is having a lot of layoffs (IT field) so scared of what might happen in the near future. Housing prices keep increasing even with govt measures to control it so not sure what else. \n\nRight wing is gaining traction in my country too. I had this idea of trying to make it to the US after my dog passes away because well its different, high paying jobs, I speak the language...but I hear tech sector is bad there and if Trump wins again not sure I want to go anyway \ud83d\ude02\n\nI also had the idea of travelling around but sometimes people in the travel or nomadic lifestyle are quite toxic, specially the travel bros. I am also not sure if I can perpetually deal with always being on the move and the potential unclean places, I get a bit paranoid about bed bugs and cholera and snakes and bears and apparently some places have wild dogs too, and who knows what else lol. \n\nSo honestly besides my dog I don't feel much purpose. Maybe it will improve when the weather improves but it feels draining now. Just a rant.","title":"Sometimes I get drained with life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/1aoxp7j\/sometimes_i_get_drained_with_life\/"}

Whenever I feel depressed and feel like giving up. I think  about how there won't be anyone else to take care of the snake. I know they may not bond like a cat or dog would.

When I was 28, I met a man on Facebook who was 38 at the time.  I cringe when I think about this.  He's very average-looking, plays a lot of golf, and sometimes does scuba diving trips to other countries.  The only reasons why I wanted to meet him in person was because he has a job in IT and is childfree.  That's it.  And what's even more cringe is that he was allowed in women's childfree spaces and made at least 4 posts about how he's snipped.  Like what did he think-- that he would end up with a harem of women?  I realized the only reason why he would go after younger women is because a woman my age sees through all of his bullshit.\n\nI am probably a heterosexual woman.  However, there are 5 criteria that I have that most men would fail, hence I am going it alone.  Those are:\n1.  Have a steady job\n2.  Have own place (I don't want to deal with psychotic roommates)\n3.  Have a car (people need one in this area)\n4.  Don't neg or be disrespectful (we wouldn't tolerate this shit from female friends)\n5.  Don't send porn gif's on whatsapp\n\nAfter the 5 criteria and after filtering out all people with personality disorders, felons, inmates, gay and bisexual men (not my preference, sorry), there is a very small percentage left.  And if you're a part of this next group, you will understand the following challenge:  IQ.  Of that small percentage left, if you're one to two standard deviations to the right of some clown, they will annoy the living F out of you.  And lastly after filtering for IQ and all those other things, he needs to be presentable enough such that you would not want to throw up when you look at him.\n\nSo onto how I've changed.  My looks have actually improved with age.  I got a great job in a major city.  I bought a house.  I have some things that I'm really passionate about like target shooting, weight lifting, and the ballet.\n\nOne thing great about the ballet is that men hate it.  So I asked a female friend to go with me and when she got to the concert hall, I surprised her with box seats!  We were both glammed up and having a wonderful time.  We knew we could just really take in and enjoy the show with worrying about getting poked and prodded at the end of the night.  If someone ever tells me they don't like the ballet, I'm not going to talk them into CoMpRoMiSInG.  I will not sit there with someone that's pouting and has a shitty look on his face the whole time.  And then at the end of the night, we'd just get into a fight and I'd yell at him to go home.  I wouldn't drop hundreds of dollars on seats to have a shitty experience.\n\nI'm either heterosexual and face the problem I described above.   Or I've branched out and am possibly bi-.  And I say that because I LOVE going to events with women.  I love the other women care about dressing up as much as I do when the event calls for it, and we can compliment eachother on our hair and nails.\n\nIdk... I have just been really wanting to post.  What do you ladies think?","title":"I have changed so much (and other ramblings)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/14bfeqr\/i_have_changed_so_much_and_other_ramblings\/"}

The game is based on Arthurian legend, and you play as Queen Guenevere after she marries Arthur and becomes queen of Camelot. And the character of Arthur really, really disgusted me and a lot of his actions made me think of male incompetence, weaponized or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat really annoyed me, though, in discussion forums, were how so many people saw his bumbling behaviour as \"cute\" and \"endearing\". The game and fans of him seem to constantly justify his behaviour by saying he has good intentions. I'm sorry, \"good intentions\" don't mean shit when actions lead to consequences like those mentioned below. I'm really sick of this narrative as well, that intentions justify the results, especially when those actions lead to such terrible consequences for the people around them (i.e. Mordred's conception, which leaves poor Morgana deeply traumatized and embittered, and is of course a betrayal of and deeply hurtful to Guenevere as well. Especially so if she and Arthur have been trying to have a child.) Not to mention, a lot of terrible, horrible, or actively abusive\/neglectful behaviour gets downplayed\/justified if the perpetrator claims, honestly or dishonestly, that they had \"good intentions\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs someone who has an extremely incompetent father and a brother who's always causing trouble, the waving-off of Arthur's behaviour as \"cute\" and \"he doesn't know better\" really irritated me. Their \"bumbling idiocy\" stops being cute and starts becoming annoying real quick, when 1. you always have to cleaning up their f\\*cking messes, 2. you can never relax because you're always worried they'll screw something up or do something to annoy\/hurt you or otherwise affect you negatively, and 3. they can't be counted on for anything. Thankfully, the only man in my life who I have to deal with full-time now is my father (and probably will be severely reduced once I'm completely financially independent).\n\nI also did a search on male weaponized incompetence and found this thread from women discussing their experiences with incompetent male partners and how negatively it affected them: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/pnkea2\/so\\_sick\\_of\\_weaponized\\_incompetence\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/pnkea2\/so_sick_of_weaponized_incompetence\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscussion of the book below:\n\n**idiotic things he does:**\n\n\\- he invites Meligaunt -- a mysterious evil sorcerer who tried to kill him when he was 13 and performs odd dark magic experiments -- into their castle.  Meligaunt is now an ambassador for a foreign country (and if you bring up these concerns, this is what he says: \"he's just an ambassador now! I'm sure he wouldn't want to do anything to disrupt the negotiations! people change!\" FACEPALM.)\n\n\\- brings sheep into the castle. They end up escaping and wrecking your room and the room of another ambassador.\n\n\\- aforementioned evil sorcerer creates many doppelgangers of your character, and uses the chaos to kidnap you.\n\n\\- if you literally TELL him that you're the real you and that the rest are doppelgangers, he insists on running after the doppelgangers anyway. In fact, he ends up chasing a doppelganger all the way to Meligaunt's island, leaving you with no help while you're literally being kidnapped and leaving the country defenseless while it's about to be invaded.\n\n\\- although this part hasn't happened yet (the game hasn't been completed), in the future, mistakes of his lead to him accidentally having sex with and impregnating his (unwilling) half-sister Morgana. (the conception of Mordred).\n\nThis isn't even to mention the many smaller ways in which he's a terrible husband to Guenevere. (For those interested: an assassin makes an attempt on Guenevere's life during their wedding ceremony, and he congratulates his best friend on him being right about his hunch that there would be an assassination attempt BEFORE he makes sure his new wife is okay. He also barely pays any attention to her at their wedding banquet - in fact, talks to her father about hunting dogs, gets into an enthusiastic conversation with a knight about ARMOR instead of paying attention to her, and is (according to the author, even, I'm not being biased) bad in bed. Also, he's willing to run off on his wedding night to \"go on an adventure\" with his best friend. Not to mention, he sees Guenevere as an accessory to his life, one who is meant to support his goals (he tells her about HIS dream and HIS vision for Britain, but never once does he ask about her dreams and goals and if\/how he could support her) and be his personal babymaker and provide him with heirs (ugh.) Also, during the aforementioned sheep incident, he forces Guen to help him with re-gathering the sheep, despite it being HIS mistake and his mess.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*phew, rant over\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(For anyone who's interested, the interactive novel was Guenevere by Jean Townsend. I love the \"becoming your own queen\" aspect of the game and I love playing a calculating, machinating queen (and I love Morgana!), but the male characters (Arthur and Lancelot) have really aged TERRIBLY and are absolute flaming garbage. At least we're supposed to get the opportunity to dump Arthur later on, and his many mistakes are supposed to come back to bite him.)","title":"SO SICK of weaponized incompetence and how male incompetence is seen as \"cute\".

It's been a long journey to even get to where I am now (trust me, I'm a lot better than I was before because thoughts like that used to gnaw at me)...but off and on when I hear about any one of those other girls I feel that pang of resentment and envy. I want it gone.\n\nPlease sisters....just need help and I'm wondering if any one of you have ever struggled with thoughts like this?","title":"When the wicked prosper: How do you stop feeling envious of the success of people who have mistreated\/bullied you?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/q37tn1\/when_the_wicked_prosper_how_do_you_stop_feeling\/"}

Read it, and even if you disagree with it, tell me what you think.\n\nIt is obvious that society nowadays does not welcome romantic love or marriage. It is obvious that men nowadays aren't interested in having a family, considering that they're bombarded everyday by our pornfied culture and choose to have multiple casual sex partners and\/or stay at home watching porn or dreaming about having a sex robot instead of actually searching for a real relationship. Also, those who engage in a serious relationship submit their woman to several episodes of physical and psychological abuse, not to mention adultery, taking feelings for granted, abandoning children, marital rape, sexism, etc.\n\nThat's why more and more women have decided to go WGTOW, myself included. And many of these women have decided they will never be in a serious relationship with men anymore, but they'll still have casual sex with them, because we all have needs. This is a blatant and self-destructing mistake and I'll tell you why.\n\n**Why casual sex literally harms women**:\n\n1. We're not exactly getting good sex from these men. We know the average Joe lasts about 5 min in bed at most, doesn't give a damn about our orgasms or pleasure. Who are we actually fooling here? Never forget men who humiliate women, point out the \"defects\" of their bodies, their cellulite, their \"small boobs\",their \"flabby thighs\" and will tell you that you need to lose weight or go to the gym because they're losing the attraction. Do you want that?\n\n2. We're giving men exactly what they want - casual sex. They're not willing to give us real emotions, but still we'll give them what they want from us. How are men ever going to change if women still offer free pussy to them? Also, when women have sex with men, they get much more emotionally attached than their counterparts. Do you want to fall in love with a guy who only sees you as a walking sex doll?\n\n3. Casual sexual relationships nowadays may put women at risk of meeting a psycho or a rapist. Just look up how many women had horror dates with men they met online or at bars and\/or were raped by these men. Are you willing to take this risk?\n\n4. We're also risking getting pregnant, or getting a STD. We know nowadays HIV transmission is getting higher and higher from men to women, it's growing faster than the transmission than among male homosexuals. I'm a medical doctor and I'm tired of seeing elderly men who are transmitting HIV and syphilis  (which they got from prostitutes) to their wives who barely leave the house.  Also, there are many cases of men who refuse to wear a condom or remove the condom during the middle of the sex act and the woman doesn't even notice it. Recently a man was arrested in Italy for purposely transmitting HIV to more than 30 women. \n\n4. And when it comes to pregnancy, we have the option to take contraceptive pills. Alright. At what costs? We all know the hormonal load in those pills only increase women's risks to have breast cancer, ovarian cancer, thrombosis, brain strokes, heart strokes. Breast cancer incidence is increasing worldwide, while men HAVE ZERO willingness to take a contraceptive pill because they don't want the risks. It's all our responsibility - both contraception and risks from it.\n\n5. And if everything fails and you get pregnant, it's highly probable that the guy won't give a damn about you, won't pay for alimony and will call you a gold digger. You'll forever be faced by this disgusting society as the whorish single mother who doesn't deserved respect from anyone. Only a few people will stand up for you and help you. When you're a single mother, you're completely by yourself. \n\n6. You'll look back to your years when you wasted your time having sex with men who didn't give a damn about you, men who condoned and supported this sexist, misogynistic, disgusting society and you'll see that you not only did not have real sexual or emotional joy, but you also lost your dignity by having sex with such chauvinists. \n\nStraight girls, have fun with your dildos and stop having sex with men. Stop giving what they want. Celibacy is the path to happiness, full control of your life, and you'll be able to focus 100% on your career\/ambitions\/family\/friends\/activity.\n\nSTOP THINKING THAT HAVING SEX WITH MEN WILL DEFINE YOU AS A WOMAN. Stop believing that you need to be desired by a man to have pleasure. You don't. Be happy by yourself, because men will never care for your happiness at all. If men want to have sex with sex bots, let them. It will finally make them leave us alone and in peace.","title":"Why casual sex culture is literally killing women and why straight women should opt for celibacy.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/7dgysd\/why_casual_sex_culture_is_literally_killing_women\/"}

Something innate that makes them crave it, and force themselves upon it despite the free-will of the person IN the body (like a drug or something)?\n\nIs it because men are more innately lonely, and they find comfort and fulfillment of their social needs in women, who are innately more social creatures? \n\nOr is it patriarchal conditioning, the concept of wanting or needing to \u201cown\u201d a woman? Touching her without her consent reminding him that he is powerful, at least more powerful than her, or powerful enough to be a \u201cman\u201d that can *at least* overpower a woman. \n\nI just never understood when a man asked me for sexy pictures.

He procrastinates and never gets anything done until the last second. Frequently making me do a lot of work because he forgot an event or never wrote it down.  What he really needs is someone standing right above him every day like he is a toddler.  Telling him once about something is not enough. I have to do it over and over and over again and then he gets that look on his face like I am a nag. \n\n\\- He doesn't listen to a word I say. Though I have been in the position 20+ years...and had bosses before him who were the best of the best... he doesn't listen to anything. Further, my job should have some autonomy to it... he always steals the decisions I should be making (while knowing nothing about how they should be done) and fails to work on the things he should be doing. \n\n\\- His office is obscene. Paperwork and food everyplace. This was a trait of my last male boss. I don't know a single woman who doesn't have a spotless office. \n\n\\- He truly resents that I am good at my job. I can just tell that he doesn't like that I am \"super\" capable. For instance if I am getting hammered with 100+ emails and I forget to send him one...he will always get super interested to point that out.  There isn't much I mess up on but he gets giddy if I mess up... and often, I don't mess up but he has to pretend I did. The other day someone in a meeting said to him that I was fantastic and he was lucky to have me. The face said it all, like he was pained to hear it. And oh by the way, he said nothing - like yes, I agree.  He never, ever ever, says good job or thanks for staying late... but if anyone else in the building just does their job he makes sure to send them a thank you email.\n\nI could fill the page but you probably recognize these \"husband\" behaviors. \n\n\\- with regard to the men in the workplace generally.... it is the same. Everyone agrees... the women in every work team are the only ones that can be relied upon.  IT, everyone calls the woman because she will respond and know what she is talking about. If I have to call another work group for something, the work groups lead by women... respond within 10 minutes. The men take 3 hours, if they bother to respond at all.  And don't go to your bosses to complain. If they are male (and of course they are) they will always defend the incompetent men, because they play basketball on the weekends together. \n\nWhen this boss was coming in I was hoping to get a woman....

The feminist theorist Obioma Nnaemeka, herself strongly opposed to FGM, argued in 2005 that renaming the practice female genital mutilation had introduced \"a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging [it]\".[241] According to Ugandan law professor Sylvia Tamale, the early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices, including not only FGM but also dry sex, polygyny, bride price and levirate marriage, required correction. African feminists \"take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women\", she wrote in 2011.[242] Commentators highlight the voyeurism in the treatment of women's bodies as exhibits. Examples include images of women's vulvas after FGM or girls undergoing the procedure.[243] The 1996 Pulitzer-prize-winning photographs of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl experiencing FGM were published by 12 American newspapers, without her consent either to be photographed or to have the images published.[244]\nThe debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for women. According to the anthropologist Christine Walley, a common position in anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of false consciousness participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, Mary Daly and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein.[245] It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that \"a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism\".\n\nAnd this disturbing data\n\n>Dahabo Musa, a Somali woman, described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the \"three feminine sorrows\": the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman is cut open, then childbirth when she is cut again.[105] Despite the evident suffering, it is women who organize all forms of FGM.[106][r] Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after the grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives.[111] Gerry Mackie has compared the practice to footbinding. Like FGM, footbinding was carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity, and appropriate marriage, and \"supported and transmitted\" by women.\nFGM practitioners see the procedures as marking not only ethnic boundaries but also gender differences. According to this view, male circumcision defeminizes men while FGM demasculinizes women.[114] Fuambai Ahmadu, an anthropologist and member of the Kono people of Sierra Leone, who in 1992 underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a Sande society initiation, argued in 2000 that it is a male-centred assumption that the clitoris is important to female sexuality. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb.[113] Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. \"[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny,\" Janice Boddy wrote in 2007. \"The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened, and exposed.\"[115]\nIn communities where infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive.[116] Some men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation.[117] The local preference for dry sex causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and Vicks menthol rub.[118] The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection.[119] Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.[120]\nCommon reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure.[121] In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 17.4 percent of women opposed FGM (558 out of 3,210), and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy.[122] Attitudes are changing slowly. In Sudan in 2010, 42 percent of women who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue.[123] In several surveys since 2006, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia, and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq, and Yemen most said it should end, although in several countries only by a narrow margin.[124]\n\nDamn, talk about internalized misoginy. :\/","title":"Female Genital Mutilation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/nvuots\/female_genital_mutilation\/"}

I live close to a skatepark that is usually not very busy and good for beginners. I also go at non-peak times so its quieter too.\n\nIt's been just a couple of weeks, but holy shit, its so fun! Why?\n\n* The feeling of freedom as you skate and get used to cruising around\n* Excitement as you can learn to do more (not fall, go up ramps, turn, start to balance on two wheels)\n* Feeling of achievement as you see progression\n* It starts to become like a healthy vice as you improve and keep wanting more\n* It's challenging, both physically and mentally (I think 60% of skateboarding is learning to not be scared out of your skull)\n* It's a really good workout and you feel pretty amped after.... then really sore haha (but good sore)\n* It's one of those activities that helps  take your mind off things and think only about it, so if you're the type whose mind runs, it's a great activity to partake in\n* It's a great way to have chill times with yourself (and others, if you find some nice people to skate with)\n\nI am past my twenties and tbh I feel like I'm too old to be starting now, but who gives a damn? You're never too old to start something or at least try it! You just have to be a bit more careful if you are older. Definitely get protective gear (helmet is a must, as well as wrist\/elbow\/knee pads), especially when you start out because most injuries typically happen in the first week for inexperienced skaters.\n\nIf you feel like learning tricks isn't for you, or you don't have a park around you, I can recommend grabbing a longboard and finding an area where the ground is smooth, and just going to skate sometimes.... the feeling of freedom remains, and eventually (pretty soon), you can use it as a mode of transport to places close-by (and also look cool :D).\n\nWould love to know if there any of you that are into skateboarding too!\n\nThere are lots of youtube channels (and also r\/NewSkaters that has a very comprehensive wiki).

While there have been examples of both genders taking part in these crafts, spinning and fiber production was often conducted by women, starting as early as the Iron Age in Europe. In fact, some archaeologists have suggested that the presence of spindles within ancient burial pits can help identify the gender of the human remains even [before skeletal analysis](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/328\/5986\/1634.2) has been performed.\u00a0\n\nSpinning is the physical process of turning fiber\u2014from plant, animal, or even mineral sources\u2014into string material that can be processed into fabric. Those natural fibers have been [cultivated](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=v1pwdjw5zoUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) since the beginning of farming. Spinning materials have been used since the Upper Paleolithic period and were continuously developed into different methods of creating yarn and thread for fabric making. In order to be spun, a strand of fiber must easily \u201ccatch\u201d to another, forming a continuous string. This is why the fibers from many [ungulates](https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/animal\/ungulate), such as sheep, can be spun into yarn, but human hair cannot. Using both tension and the weight of the yarn, the spinner pulls out a longer thread and winds the completed yarn onto a spool. The yarn or thread can then be processed through hanging and stretching, usually with a variety of different chemicals such as lye, soap, dye, and even human urine. The processed yarn is typically wound [into a ball](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/325\/5946\/1329.1) or other form of wrapped containment to allow knitter or weaver to keep it in order while making fabric. Ultimately, the fabric is made into clothing, bedding, and other household goods.\n\nHow spinning became women\u2019s work is a complex phenomenon. Spinning was often done in quiet environments at home, allowing the worker to stop and start as needed, and as a result, the task often fell to women. Naturally, this craft required skilled practice and to be done in a fairly controlled environment, a kind of home textiles laboratory. Anthropologist Judith Brown in her 1970 paper,  [\"Note on the Division of Labor by Sex](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/671420?seq=1),\u201d argues that in early human cultures the art of spinning was best attuned to the members of a society who were constantly doing multiple tasks at once that require routine practice. For women, the creation of fabric was a task that could be combined with childcare. Spinning and weaving could be picked up and put down as needed, and it was relatively easy to do at the side of other activities such as attending children or nursing a baby. Textiles scholar Elizabeth Barber also argues for this, saying that if one is responsible for a wide variety of tasks, such as food preparation, child care, and housework, having tasks that are easily stopped and started again at the same place helped lead to production of a finished item that could be used for practical purpose.\u00a0\n\n \n\nBarber has shown that [unmarried or widowed women](https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/Women_s_Work_The_First_20_000_Years_Wome\/UanOCQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) often found themselves picking up extra money by spinning on the side. Even though women were being paid for this [skilled and important labor](https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/Prehistoric_Textiles\/HnSlynSfeEIC?hl=en&gbpv=1), their male counterparts who worked with the yarns they made often received credit for women\u2019s design and industry. In the 18th century, for example, [complaints](https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/No_Idle_Hands\/8dFMltjhi0YC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) from male weaving guilds in England indicated that American textile workers, mostly women at home, were a threat to their dominance in the textile industry, and to Britain\u2019s control over America.\u00a0\n\nSpinning became a factory-oriented process during the Industrial Revolution, and women spinners were ultimately replaced by machines. But the creation of threads and fabric was still dominated by a working class of women, many of them children and immigrants working in textile factories. Like spinning from the previous century, industrialized textile production allowed unmarried girls and women the ability to earn a small amount of pay. However, the conditions couldn\u2019t be more different from those of home-spinners. Factory workers had to quickly learn patterns, identify fibers, and work with complicated, dangerous machinery, often for very low pay in poor conditions. When spinning and fabric-making moved from the hearth to the factory, the profits of women\u2019s labor still accrued to the men who owned the companies and factories.\u00a0\n\nTraditional modes of yarn-making and hand-spinning, like many complex skills developed largely by women, have been relegated to the craft and hobby realm. After the advent of machines and the rise of leisure activities, spinning was no longer a sign of a women\u2019s knowledge, rather it indicated that she had ample free time to focus on crafting. While many still view spinning, knitting, and sewing as a novelty craft, some [women scientists](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/05\/17\/science\/math-physics-knitting-matsumoto.html) are reevaluating the craft through the lens of science, showing that these skills are mathematically and technologically complex. Even though it shouldn\u2019t take science to tell women what they\u2019ve known about this skill for centuries, it\u2019s refreshing to see people take women\u2019s work seriously as something much more than a frivolous pastime.\u00a0","title":"Spinster Science","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/nzed25\/spinster_science\/"}

Her innovations resulted in lower death rates \u2013 first in hospitals, then in wider society.\n\nShe formulated and implemented enormous reforms of nurse training and nursing practices. Before Nightingale\u2019s reforms, nurses were seen as unhygienic and unreliable. Afterwards, they were seen as clean, medically trained, and well-disciplined.\n\nAfter experiencing first-hand the reluctance of people in government to change the way things were done, and realizing they were often too lazy to read reports, she started presenting statistics as pictures, popularizing the polar area diagram.\n\n\nBeginnings\nFlorence\u2019s father, William Nightingale, was well educated and intellectually inclined. He had inherited great wealth from an uncle.\n\nFlorence\u2019s mother, Frances Smith, enjoyed a rather leisurely life. She also came from a very wealthy family background.\n\nhe family returned home when Florence was one year old, and she was brought up on family estates in England: in Embley and Lea Hurst.\nShe and her sister loved exploring the countryside, and Florence kept a written record of the flowers she observed. She loved cats and had many pets including a pig, a donkey, and a pony. Later in life she would say pets make excellent companions for people suffering from chronic illnesses.\n\nFlorence\u2019s father home-schooled his daughters to an extremely high standard, reproducing the education he had received at the University of Cambridge, teaching them French, German, Italian, Greek, Latin, Philosophy, and Mathematics. Florence was a polymath with exceptional skills \u2013 Benjamin Jowett, Master of Oxford\u2019s Balliol College, sought her opinion on his translations of the Greek philosopher Plato.\n\nFlorence\u2019s mother ensured her daughters had the social skills required of upper-class girls: there was always another dance, or dinner party, or weekend in the country to look forward to.\n\n\nA Serious Girl on a Grand Tour\nFlorence tired of the social scene; she wanted greater meaning from her life. Aged 16, she believed God had called her to service.\n\nFrom private diary: \u201cI craved for some regular occupation, for something worth doing instead of frittering away my time on useless trifles.\u201d FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE\n\nBetween the ages of 17 and 19, her parents took her on another Grand Tour, delaying the day she could follow her calling.\n\nMathematics\nAged 19, and opposed by her parents, Florence undertook a serious study of mathematics and engaged a tutor to help her.\n\n\nThe Hungry Forties\nThe 1840s were harsh years in the United Kingdom, with high unemployment. Florence Nightingale, now in her twenties, refused to ignore the suffering she saw around her. In 1843, aged 23, she started making home visits to help poor people. The following year she started working in hospitals. Her parents thwarted an attempt she made to train as a nurse at Salisbury Hospital.\n\nIn 1849 she exasperated her parents again, this time by rejecting a proposal of marriage from Richard Monckton Miles, a social reformer. Nightingale recorded in her diary that her nature had three needs to be fulfilled: intellectual, passionate, and moral. She found him suitable on the first two points, but not the third.\n\nTo escape the strife at home, friends took her on vacation to Germany. Defying her parents, she lived in a hospital, Kaiserswerth, observing the treatments offered there. She wrote a 32-page paper recording her observations, which she published anonymously in 1851.\n\n\nSpied Upon\nAt home, things were terrible. Florence was now over thirty years old. Her sister was jealous of her independent spirit and her intellectual friends. Her mother scolded her for not becoming a lady of society, spied on her, opened her mail, and prevented her seeing some of her friends.\n\n\nFreedom\nIn 1853, aged 33, Florence Nightingale escaped. She got a job in London in charge of an institution caring for sick women. Her father had realized how unhappy the restricted life she led at home was making her. He secretly began paying her an allowance of \u00a3500 a year \u2013 enough for her to be comfortable and independent. On hearing she was leaving home for London, her mother wept and her sister became hysterical.\n\n\nImproving Care, Reducing Death Rates\nSick Women in London\nNightingale was a formidably efficient organizer. In her first post in London, she completely transformed the hospital regime. She had hot water piped to every floor and lifts installed to transport hot food quickly. She introduced quality inspections of bedding, equipment, and food, and made sure these were purchased on the best terms. She made sure the food served was nutritious. Within a few months, she replaced most of the existing hospital staff with people who were more enthusiastic, competent, and caring.\n\nNightingale\u2019s reputation for making dramatic improvements to healthcare spread quickly.\n\nSaving Lives in Turkey\nIn October 1854, the British Government asked Nightingale to travel to Scutari, near Istanbul, in Turkey and take full charge of nursing there.\n\nBritain, France, and Turkey were at war with Russia. British soldiers were dying in greater numbers in the hospitals and of cholera than on the battlefield, and the public had been enraged by scathing newspaper reports of the appalling situation.\n\nNursing was looked on as a disreputable job undertaken by rather dreadful women who drank hard liquor. Nightingale wanted to change that. She agreed to the government\u2019s request and was given the power to select the nurses she would take with her. They would have to be emotionally strong women, prepared to live in the toughest conditions and work with distressing cases and wounds. Nightingale took a team of 38, consisting of 14 hospital nurses, 14 Anglican sisters, and 10 Roman Catholic nuns.\n\nWhen they arrived on November 3, 1854, Scutari was like hell on earth. It was seething with filth, decay, disease, death, and men in a pitiful state, covered in fleas and lice. Wounded soldiers were having limbs sawn off without anesthetic, unscreened from other patients. Huge numbers of new casualties were expected imminently.\n\nRemarkably, the doctors at Scutari did not want any help from Nightingale\u2019s team. Rather than argue, she decided to put her nurses on standby and do nothing. Assessing the situation and considering the impact of a new influx of casualties, she expected the doctors would ask for help soon enough. And they did.\n\nNightingale had to fight against three squabbling government departments to implement improvements at Scutari. Things improved, albeit too slowly for her.\n\nA Legend Is Born\nNightingale was idolized by the soldiers, who could see she was working herself to exhaustion to care for them and improve their lot.\n\nDuring her first winter at Scutari, 4,000 soldiers died. Nightingale ensured no soldier died alone. She was personally present offering comfort at 2,000 deaths. Gradually she made improvements to the bedding and the cleanliness of the hospital, constantly battling against resistance from the doctors.\n\nSuccess and Personal Illness\nDespite her selfless devotion to the soldiers housed at Scutari, and the legend that grew around her as a nurse, it\u2019s important to remember that Nightingale was not really a nurse.\n\nShe was a scientist, a data-gatherer, a writer, a trainer, a manager, an organizer, an analyst, and a campaigner; these varied skills, combined with an enormous appetite for hard work and a driven personality characterized her professional life.\n\nThe government was energized to send a Sanitary Commission to Scutari in March 1855. This resulted in the repair, cleaning, and ventilation of sewers; installation of ventilation shafts; increased spacing between patients; site drainage; removal of open toilets; installation of a system to flush the drains several times daily; and the walls of wards being washed several times daily with lime.\n\nThe death rate at the hospital at Scutari fell from over 50 percent in Nightingale\u2019s first weeks to 2 percent. She recognized the crucial importance of the Sanitary Commission\u2019s work in bringing down the death rate and she resolved to implement better sanitation wherever she had influence.\n\nNightingale was physically and emotionally drained by her work, and became ill with fever. She was probably infected by brucellosis in milk. Undiagnosed at the time, this disease, with its attendant debilitating spondylitis, affected her for the rest of her long life. At times the spondylitis would cause her such agony that she could not move. Much of her future statistical analysis and campaigning would be done from a couch or bed.\n\n\u201cThere is not an official who would not burn me like Joan of Arc if he could, but they know the War Office cannot turn me out because the country is with me.\u201d FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.. 1856, Letter to Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War\n\nImproving Healthcare, Improving Lives\nNightingale took a holistic approach to the health of soldiers in Turkey, an approach she would follow for the rest of her life.\n\nShe saw that soldiers in hospital were badly fed, and used funds generated following newspaper publicity for her work to buy the soldiers better food.\n\nAgainst the wishes of the Army officers at Scutari, who said it would be bad for discipline, she equipped the hospital with a reading room, where soldiers could find books and newspapers for mental stimulation. This was very popular with the soldiers and there were no discipline problems.\n\nSeeing for herself that excessive alcohol consumption was a problem for many of the healthy soldiers, she researched the issue and learned there was no system in place for soldiers to send money home. She started a money transfer system, with the result that the solders began sending large amounts of money home rather than consuming it the form of alcohol.\n\nShe set up a popular coffee house as an alternative to alcohol. She was not, however, a puritan. She thought it would be a good idea if soldiers would drink less, but nuns drink more!\n\nNo Wish to be a Celebrity \u2013 Grief and Guilt\nBy now Nightingale\u2019s mother and sister were basking in her reflected social glory and had become enthusiastic about her work. Nightingale herself, however, had no wish for celebrity. After she heard large numbers of people were going to give her a rousing reception when she came back from Turkey, she traveled as Miss Smith and arrived home quietly. She refused to make public appearances.\n\nShe was in fact privately grief-stricken for all the thousands of men she had tended to and seen die in horrible circumstances in Turkey. She also felt guilty that many of the deaths from disease had been preventable, if only she had known more about the importance of strict sanitary practices. The grief and guilt would stay with her forever, increasing her determination to prevent suffering wherever it was found.\n\nA Source of Inspiration\nDespite Nightingale\u2019s own misgivings, her work inspired many others to take action, including Henry Dunant: \u201cThough I am known as the founder of the Red Cross and the originator of the Convention of Geneva, it is to an English woman that all the honor of that convention is due. What inspired me to go to Italy during the war of 1859 was the work of Miss Florence Nightingale.\u201d HENRY DUNANT.. 1872, Founder of the Red Cross\n\nInventing Modern Nursing\nIn 1859, Nightingale completed her book Notes on Nursing, the founding work of modern nursing.\n\nShe set up the Nightingale Fund, raising enough money to establish the Nightingale Training School at London\u2019s St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital in 1860. Nurses would now be medically trained to care for patients: nursing would become a respected profession.\n\nIn 1863, she published the third and weightiest edition of her highly influential book Notes on Hospitals. Her personal experiences still in mind, she penned words as relevant to hospitals today as they were then:\u201cIt may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital that it should do the sick no harm.\u201d FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE .. 1863, Notes on Hospitals\n \nShe knew some hospitals were manipulating statistics to make themselves look good:\n\n\u201c\u2026accurate hospital statistics are much more rare than is generally imagined, and take no cognizance of those cases which are discharged in a hopeless condition, to die immediately afterwards, a practice which is followed to a much greater extent by some hospitals than others.\u201d FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE 1863, Notes on Hospitals\n \nNightingale\u2019s book covered hospital sanitation and design, highlighting the features that worked best. She showed how statistics should be gathered to best assess outcomes of ward practices and surgical practices.\n\nLinda Richards trained at the Nightingale Training School in 1877, and then returned to the USA, where she established high-quality nursing schools across the country.\n\nStatistics, Sanitation, and Life Expectancy\nIn 1859, Nightingale was elected to the Royal Statistical Society \u2013 its first female member.\n\nShe utilized her mathematical training to analyze the causes of sickness and death, first in hospitals and then in broader society. She popularized the use of polar area diagrams to ensure the points she was making could be understood by politicians and civil servants \u2013 from experience, she did not trust these people to read reports properly.\n\nShe often won arguments about the best way to proceed in healthcare through her mastery of statistics.\n\nFrom her experiences in Scutari, she advocated sanitary reform for the British Army in India, which reduced the death rate from 69 to 18 per 1,000 within a decade.\n\nIn the UK as a whole, sanitary reforms advocated by Nightingale \u2013 compulsory sanitation in private homes for example \u2013 and supported by her statistics and polar charts are largely credited with improving average life expectancy by 20 years between 1871 and 1935.\n\nOne of Nightingale\u2019s polar charts (digitally enhanced). Even a politician can read this to see that, as time passes, the number of deaths per month is getting smaller. The colors show the cause of death.\n\nSome Personal Details and the End\nNightingale had a number of male admirers, and during her life received at least two proposals of marriage. However, she believed God had chosen her for her work, and she never married or had children.\n\nShe retained a lifelong affinity with the city she was named after, and loved to speak Italian and would use Italian words and phrases while speaking English with friends.\n\nShe loved music: her favorite composer was Mozart.\n\nFrom 1857 onwards, Nightingale was often confined to bed by spondylitis pain or depression caused by brucellosis. Despite this, she managed to achieve a seismic shift in the UK\u2019s sanitation and public health programs, using her reputation to push politicians and officials into action.\nIn 1883, she received the Royal Red Cross from Queen Victoria, who deeply admired Nightingale\u2019s work, and invited her to speak with her on several occasions. In 1907, she became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit.\n\nFrom about the age of 70, Nightingale slowed down and became less driven, spending more time enjoying the company of friends. In the last 10 years or so of her life, she lost most of her eyesight and became somewhat senile.\n\nFlorence Nightingale died in her sleep in London on August 13, 1910. She was 90 years old. She had been offered burial alongside some of Britain\u2019s greatest heroes in Westminster Abbey, but turned this down. She actually requested her body be used for medical research, but this did not happen.\n\nShe was buried quietly, beside her parents, in the graveyard of St Margaret\u2019s Church near her childhood home of Embley Park. There was a huge service in her honor at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, attended by the King. A choir of 1,000 nurses sang at it.\n\nFlorence Nightingale was revered in her lifetime and is still revered today.","title":"Florence Nightingale Women Going Her Own Way","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/fm9jaw\/florence_nightingale_women_going_her_own_way\/"}

Jessie Gallan\n\n109-year-old Jessie Gallan of Scotland made headlines in January 2015 when she told the Daily Mail that the secret to living a long life is \"staying away from men.\" Gallan elaborated, \"I also made sure that I got plenty of exercise, eat a nice warm bowl of porridge every morning, and have never gotten married.\" Having been born in 1906, it honestly is amazing that Gallan never once succumbed to the fears of \"spinsterhood\" and instead made independence her priority. While she passed away in March 2015, we can be certain that it had NOTHING to do with a controlling, draining marriage.\n\n2. Jane Austen\n\nJane Austen may have been a queen when it came to writing romances; however, girl did not need one to be fulfilled or successful (check that literary body of work \u2014 Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, need I say more?). Now, Austen did get herself a marriage proposal which she originally accepted, until she realized he was not a partner with whom she'd be happy. So, in 24 hours, she told him that she changed her mind like the bad bitch she was. Shortly thereafter, Austen sent a note to her niece that read, \"Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection.\" #preach\n\n 3. Louisa May Alcott\n\nLouisa May Alcott was an #IndependentWoman who early on decided that it would not be marriage that allowed her to escape from poverty, but literary success. An 1856 entry from her journal reads, \"I love luxury, but freedom and independence better.\" And even when she saw the riches bestowed on a recently wed sister during her honeymoon, she wrote in her journal, \"Very sweet and pretty, but I'd rather be a free spinster and paddle my own canoe.\" This ideology also manifested itself in her classic novel Little Women, when Jo denies the proposal of a wealthy man.\n\n4. Mary Cassatt\n\nIt's hard to care about marriage when you're a little busy being one of the only recognized and successful female Impressionist painters of the 19th century. Cassatt's paintings still sell for millions of dollars, and are famous for their depiction of maternal relationships (which points to the fact that choosing not to have children personally does not mean that you look down on those who do have children). Cassatt once said, \"I am independent! I can live alone and I love to work!\"\n\n5. Mae Jemison\n\nIn 1992, Mae Jemison became the first American black woman to go to space on the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Before that, she was a doctor (no big), then she was in the Peace Corps (similarly no big), then NASA asked her to join their astronaut corps. Following her history-making turn as an astronaut, she guest starred on Star Trek and received 9 honorary doctorate degrees. Jemison is also still killin' it as an engineer and a teacher. Funny then that this 1993 article from People magazine somehow found it relevant to use the descriptor \"unmarried,\" considering they could have used practically anything else. I think Mae might have been a little more interested in dominating her otherworldly dreams than getting married, wouldn't you say?","title":"5 Awesome Women Who Swore By Being Single","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/eyli21\/5_awesome_women_who_swore_by_being_single\/"}

Therefore wives are more likely to grow bored\/dissatisfied with their husbands, and their husbands should focus on keeping the women in their lives happy, rather than vice versa. Could also point out that the average woman is far more attractive than the average man, and has FAR more options (just look at men\u2019s and women\u2019s statistics on dating apps, on how many matches the average woman gets compared to the average man.)\n\n\u201c**She will\/you will be lonely forever**\u201c - bring up that it\u2019s mostly male projection. Bring up how men are more likely nowadays to be single and lonely, and that partnered men\u2019s health and happiness increases, while that of married women decreases. Also could mention how men\u2019s friendships are less emotiomally connected and supportive, and how they are less good at maintaining family bonds than women as well.\n\n\u201c**Beauty is only quality that matters in women**\u201d - I would bring up examples of intelligent, compassionate, successful women and their qualities and achievements. (And possibly ask what they have achieved in their lives?) I would also point out how most men don\u2019t style, groom, dress well, and are frankly not very attractive physically. (Also maybe point out some examples of men aging poorly and losing their looks very quickly.)\n\n\u201c**Women should respect men**\u201d - I would ask why men deserve respect. Then usually debunk their answer. (ie. Men built society. \u2014-> a couple of, several men have contributed to building society, does not mean you deserve or can take credit for someone else\u2019s achievements. B.c they support their families \u2014\u2014-> well, don\u2019t women also support their families by (in a lot of cases) also working, cooking and cleaning for their family members, not to mention emotional labour, managing the lives of their family members (appointments, lessons, etc) B.c all people deserve respect - then don\u2019t women deserve respect, too?) Or possibly something along the lines of \u201crespect should be earned. No one\u2019s entitled to my\/your respect.\u201d\n\n\u201c**Women should lower their standards**\u201d - \u201cwhy, so they\u2019d then go out with you?\u201d Tell them that sounds like a blueprint to be dissatisfied and disappointed in a relationship. I also say that women don\u2019t expect too much from men, men expect too little from themselves.","title":"Responses to common misogynistic statements","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/14o6qxp\/responses_to_common_misogynistic_statements\/"}

Someone posted an article yesterday on this sub the \"7 reasons why I quit dating\" and it really resonated with me. I decided to share my WGTOW story with you guys.\n\nI ended up in a unhealthy cycle of being in back-to-back relationships without space for myself. I feel suffocated and for once in my life, I actually really crave being alone. I'm so sick of allowing shitty men in my life.\n\nIt's not all men. I have a wonderful father, uncle, guy friends who are like brothers. But it's the men I end up with. It must be something about me that I attract the worst guys. I have a good head on my shoulders, I'm getting my degree, working, volunteering, have a strong savings account, very seldom drink\/do drugs. But I have a baby face and I'm very soft spoken. I'm very sweet, giving and nurturing. And I think I'm all those things to a fault. These things about me attract controlling men who eat that shit up. It seems they look for someone like me: A sweet little wife-material girl (but of course they still wanna oggle at hotter women when I'm not around) There are nice guys out there, but all my dating life I wasn't wise enough to set boundaries early. So I need a fresh start.\n\nThe lack of respect I get from these boyfriends is astonishing. Even when I think their nice at first, this always ends up happening. I've been cheated on and they deny it up and down even with evidence. I had one bf who I let stay at my house because he got kicked out and after a year of listening to all his stupid problems, doing everything he wanted to do (sitting in the house watching him smoke weed) and washing his shit-stained boxers he decided to try to cheat on me numerous times once he moved into an apartment with his friends.\n\nI'm actually about to dump my current boyfriend to go my own way. He's actually the best boyfriend yet but can be really irritating, clingy, demands too much of my time when I'm busy with work and classes. He really undermines the stress of my life and it pisses me off. In his household, his mom does everything for him- cook, clean. His dad brought him a car. I pay for everything. I do my own cooking and cleaning and I work\/volunteer, school full time and I'm about to get a second job. So when I want free time to myself or my friends he gets annoyed that I don't prioritize him then he says \"so-and-so is a med student and can still make time. your major is not that hard.\" He tries to tell me to wear make up. He criticizes things I wear if he doesn't like them then whines about how I don't put in enough effort into my appearance even though he wears fucking t-shirts and khaki shorts every day. He got annoyed that I didn't shave my arm pits. Curses at me over disagreements then hangs the fact that I owe him money over my head.\n\nThat's another thing to: All the name calling I get from a lot of my boyfriends. And god forbid I want some alone time and to do something for myself, I'm selfish. They don't care what I go through. They only care about themselves. Anytime I've ever tried to open up to a boyfriend about my feelings \"hey, I've been really depressed lately.\"   \"hey, I'm starting to feel a little neglected, can we talk about it?\" Everyone I ever dated either undermines my problem, turns it around and makes it about them or accuses me of being ungrateful. I don't remember a single time where any of my problems in a relationship has been addressed. Yet, I listen to these shitheads talk about themselves for hours. Funny, huh?\n\nI'm just so fucking done. I want to be alone. I have no sex drive anymore. I just want me time. I just wanna hang out with my friends and family. Solo hikes, hobbies, focusing on my studies. No more boyfriends. But when I try to break up with this bf he starts crying and I feel bad. I know I have to do it though.\n\nI'm so jaded about relationships. I'm so sick of these cheating, controlling men who make me feel like I have to keep competing and trying to look better, change myself when I'm wonderful the way I am. \n\nI'm sick of being a fucking servant, listening to men talk about themselves for hours about themselves. Their shitty, unsolicited advice whenever I do something. Demanding my time. Taking taking taking and not giving anything back.\n\nOne day, in the future, maybe I will find one of those mystical nice men. But I must work on myself first, and radiate confidence to the world. Right now, I want to go my own way. I am going to get the balls to dump this guy and be voluntarily single for the next few years.\n\nI have a lot of really great aspirations and a lovely life. No need to deal with boyfriend drama.\n\nEDIT: Aww, cute lil' fragile incel egos being crushed because I'm standing up for myself from men :- )","title":"Why I'm going my own way","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/7771lv\/why_im_going_my_own_way\/"}

Basically how much of our souls we must sell to the patriarchy in order to function and if it's worth the cost. Walking that thin line without  getting ensnared.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nSpeaking more plainly, what I am trying to say is that as women we have essentially two choices: separatism or playing the game.\n\nSeparatism is nice but unless someone comes up with a female utopia, we still have to deal with males, male-identified women and their rules. Playing the game might be a better choice.\n\nWhat I am asking is, when you have to \"act female\" in society, how much exactly are you comfortable with, how much of a show are you willing to put up, and why? (the things I mention below are things you do that aren't you but that help fit in, if you personally like those things then ignore)\n\n* wearing makeup and \"girly\" clothes. wearing those ridiculous fckn panties and other uncomfortable stupid shit\n* shaving (yep, everywhere because apparently that's the norm these days)\n* tone of voice, eye contact. not appearing \"too manly\" and too blunt\n* hanging out with girls you can't stand and participating in gossip\n* female socialization\n* career choices\n* being quiet\/turning a blind eye to sexism (in the workplace and elsewhere)\n* marriage, kids, etc\n* relationships\n* social media, public image\n* hobbies\n* deferring to males, behavior towards males\n\nIt's as if you're almost a spy. For many women this sort of thing comes easy but alas, I'm not one of them.\n\nMy question is, how far do you go\/are willing to go\/have you gone in your life acting in a \"stereotypically female\" way to fit in and for some advantage, or just to get your mind off smaller anxieties (ie about clothing) about things people might judge you for so you have more bandwidth for more important issues? Do you feel like there's a balance? Do you feel that acting this way closes you off from meaningful relationships? To what degree should we compromise so we can move more easily in society and affect some change? Do you feel like you are allowing yourself to be corrupted in a way? Discuss.\n\nPersonally, I'm going through a phase where I'm wearing more feminine clothing and taking better care of my appearance (and shaving my legs and armpits at least). And wear a bra (most days). And smile more. And be more soft in the way I talk. Be more like those girls I've always resented for being too fake. It's dumb as shit but if I don't have to worry about people thinking I'm weird I can fit in better and that takes some anxiety off of my mind.\n\nA very sneaky part of me enjoys the little act and tricking people, not so much the clothes and the girly shit, but maybe that's just me. It's pretty baffling how far appearances get you.","title":"Picking your battles","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/1e962az\/picking_your_battles\/"}

Some time later I simply asked why they felt the need to concern themselves with my celibacy. Well, the real truth is that I had set weak boundaries regarding conversations. I told my friends that I don't feel comfortable giving them advice with their relationship issues anymore. Which I thought was a good boundary, but they took my boundary to mean that they could rant endlessly and I would sit there and listen. Every meet up would turn into them taking turns complaining about their relationships they choose to continue. So, according to them, I essentially said that I didn't care to hear anymore because I'm single and that's what they get for dating known cheaters. Granted, I think I was kinder than that, but it's been months and I can't guarantee that I was really as polite as I remember. Which is why the next meet up was them convincing me that I'm miserable and lonely. In hindsight, I should have said \"I will not engage in any conversations that center around your dating life\". \n\nI don't talk to them or meet up with them anymore. They can take the glory in cutting me off if that's what they need to do. It hurts. We were friends since college and we would buy friendship jewelry. I admit that I used to fit in because I would endlessly complain with them. I've only recently decentered romance. So I get that this is new behavior and they're not used to it. At the same time, I'd try to talk to them about traveling, hobbies, hair care--anything else but romance--and they would simply give short answers so they could go back to complaining. So I know it's not just \"you were rude when speaking to us\". They're also pissed that I'm tired of hearing their drama and they can no longer use me as a human diary. \n\nI have found new women to talk to, but I'm cautious forming a tight bound these days. I've accepting that being a WGTOW involves heavily vetting friends to ensure that I can engage in peaceful conversations.\n\nAnd for posting, I'm going to be more positive.

Her work introduced readers to educated strong female heroines. As a result, her writing style greatly impacted American literature.\n\nAlcott was born on November 29, 1832 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Alcott\u2019s parents were a part of the 19th century transcendentalist movement, a popular religious movement. Their religious and political beliefs deeply inspired Alcott as child. Her father, Bronson Alcott, was a popular educator who believed that children should enjoy learning. Therefore, at an early age, Alcott took to reading and writing. While most of her schooling came from her parents she also studied under famed philosopher Henry David Thoreau and popular authors Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathanial Hawthorne. Much like her novel Little Women, Alcott was one of four daughters and she remained close with her sisters throughout her life. Many times, Alcott\u2019s family suffered from financial woes, forcing her to attend school irregularly. She took many jobs to help alleviate financial struggles, working as teacher and washing laundry. She turned to writing for both emotional and financial support.\n\nHer first poem, \u201cSunlight,\u201d was published in a magazine under a pseudonym. Her first book, a compilation of short stories, was published in 1854.  When the Civil War started in 1861, Alcott served as a nurse in a Union hospital. Unfortunately, in the middle of her assignment she contracted typhoid fever. Her experience in the hospital as a patient and a nurse, inspired the novel Hospital Sketches. After the war, Alcott published several other works and gained a following. Her audience included both adults and children. She also released many of her earlier works under the name, A.M. Barnard.\n\nDuring this time, one of Alcott\u2019s publishers asked her to write a novel for young women. To do so, she simply reflected back on to her childhood with her sisters. In 1868, Alcott published her most popular work, Little Women. The novel was published in a series of short stories, but was eventually compiled into one book. Little Women was an instant success and the book cemented Alcott as one of the foremost novelist of the 19th and early 20th century. In 1870, with one successful book, Alcott moved to Europe with her sister May. There she published, another classic Little Men. She also joined the women\u2019s suffrage movement. Throughout her life, she would contribute to several publications which promoted women\u2019s rights. She was also the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Connecticut.\n\nAlcott never married nor had any children, however, when her sister died, she adopted her niece. Afterwards she moved to Boston, Massachusetts and continued publishing more works that followed the characters from Little Women. Alcott suffered from bouts of illness throughout her life. She attributed her poor health to mercury poisoning which she believed she contracted while she worked as a nurse during the Civil War. In 1888, she died at the age of 56 in Boston, Massachusetts. Today, readers continue to enjoy Alcott\u2019s writings and her novels still appear on bestseller list throughout the world.","title":"Louisa May Alcott (WGTOW)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/g56hqs\/louisa_may_alcott_wgtow\/"}

However, we are not associated with them. **Wgtow is a philosophy based on feminist separatism.** It's called wgtow because that simply makes it easier for the average female redditor who never heard about feminist separatism to find (e.g. by coming across hateful communities and then asking herself \"hmm, but does wgtow exist?\" - we do, we were here first, and unlike that male sub with a similar name we don't advocate for violence against men or yell that men deserve to be raped...).\n\nSimilarly, you might have found FDS because you had little luck in dating, found that FDS was not very helpful, then looked for WGTOW. I don't blame you, and you might find that being a WGTOW is just the best lifestyle for you. But if you are simply frustrated about dating, you might find better places to vent elsewhere. Many of us here have not dated in a while, don't want to date and don't care for what FDS calls a \"HVM\".\n\nWhile I don't think FDS is even a bit as bad as the redpill-type subs, **both of these communities use dehumanizing language** (I haven't seen so much redpill-lingo here lately, so I'm going to focus more on FDS in this post). E.g. FDS assigns \"value\" to both men or women depending on how much they fit into what narrow characteristics they deem acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, using a special jargon can make **new members unfamiliar with reddit\/fds lingo feel excluded**. Let's not alienate the badass old lady who lives alone in her garden shed and just discovered reddit (and wgtow), coming across strange terms she has no idea what they mean. **Let's not alienate the users who found us through other channels by using language that is strongly associated with subs that hold narrow opinions.** You might agree with everything FDS says, but I assure you, many others may not and they have a place in WGTOW just as much as you do.\n\nFor that reason\\*\\*, using a certain lingo can be a characteristic of a cult\\*\\*. You need to \"learn\" it when you get into the cult. Once you know all the terms, you are an insider, you have a jargon that connects you to the other members and feel more similar to them (even though you are not). It also eases you into \"learning\" their principles, instead of critically examining them. Having a \"term\" for something can make it seem more true, or even scientific. They show you a simplified way to look at the world, they give you a handbook that you should follow... If a woman asks FDS for help, she either apologizes for \"not reading the handbook first\" or FDS members scold her when she hasn't obliged to one of their principles...really? You are an adult women, you can think for yourself.\n\nYes, I know we all came across women who bend over backwards to get a little bit of reward from the patriarchy, but we can criticize them without calling them \"pick-mes\". **Those umbrella terms are used to label almost anything now and add no thought to a debate per se.** Instead, we can criticize what exactly is wrong with their behaviour and discuss about what might have lead to this behaviour.\n\nWe are not a cult and we can hold diverse opinions. We don't need a common lingo. We don't need dehumanizing language. Let's be better.","title":"Can we please stop using FDS or redpill lingo?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/jtltp2\/can_we_please_stop_using_fds_or_redpill_lingo\/"}

You've all been hurt in the same ways repeatedly because it's harder to learn a lesson than it is to try again. There are legitimate arguments in regard to the archetypal and stereotypical shades of personality that harmed you. \n\nMark Twain once said that there are 3 kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics. He was speaking to both WGTOW and MGTOW when he said that, and what he was getting at is most commonly known as \"confirmation bias\" these days. It's had a bunch of names throughout history, and even more aphorisms (like \"you find what you look for\", for example) to describe it, but in the end, all it is is a mechanism by which we protect our sense of self.\n\nUntil we are ready to make the changes based on the lessons we learned (if we even learned a lesson), we will create walls to explain away our inaction. For instance, take an obese person: They know full well that their problem is over-indulgence, but I have, personally, and recently, seen a lady that I work with tell me in absolute melancholic sincerity that \"I just can't eat tuna without mayonnaise.. I just *can't*..\" when talking to me about her diet problems. She also says things like \"a meal is not a mean without meat\". She is living that way because she doesn't live in reality, which sounds harsh, but I say it with good reason, that I will explain. \n\nShe does not live in reality, in this case, because she does not use her senses to guide her through a sensual thing: She uses her mind in place of hunger. She almost certainly has not experienced true hunger in a long, long time, though she is the first to say she is hungry. Her cure is the same cure for smokers, and I say this having both been overweight, and a smoker: mindful consumption. That's it. The smoker needs to be fully aware while he smokes, and the overeater needs to be fully present while he eats. After some time, you begin to see \"I'm not really hungry at all\", and \"this cigarette isn't doing anything for me, really\", then you begin to wait for your body to signal you, then you notice you over ate and over smoked. Next time, you're ready. You still wait for the hunger, but your goal is now to appease said hunger, not use it as a vehicle for pleasure. Maintain that for a few weeks, and you won't feel like you've given something up, but instead, realized what you didn't need in the first place. \n\nMake your subs places of mindful action. Be ready to work the lessons that you have learned, and work them into good, even if that results in solitude, solidarity, or solipsism. Make arguments, not accusations, and bring them humbly to those you feel are in error.  \n\nThank you for sticking with me. This does have a point, I promise you. \n\nI think that, if both of you guys' subs mixed, just sometimes, like maybe both of you host a sticky for debate, then it would be like a sort of ego mirror for you all. You could see yourselves reflected in those you hate, if I may be so bold, and there are few things more potent in the world of metaphysical change than a good ego miror. I'm sure you've all seen stories about men who have quit the KKK because they made friends with a black man. It is that same thing that could happen here, but with an entire group instead of just a few people. All it would take to get things moving would be a few good stories, a few examples of two people from both subs finding common ground, and on it, love. \n\nI think that if you each made it a point to try to find the ways you are the same, even if united in hatred, you would find, in the end, that you are all fighting the same thing: perverted values taking the mainstage in all of western culture. You all believe that what is right to you is wrong to others and what is wrong to you is right to others; that things have been turned upside down and the world is now evil. Maybe you think that it's always been this way but now you are awakened to it. Maybe you think it's a recent phenomenon. \n\nMGTOW is the hope of WGTOW and WGTOW is the hope of MGTOW. You are the broken hearted (I am among you), the spurned, the cuckolded and the cuckqueaned, the beaten and the abused. You are those who have been hurt and have given up hope. \n\nIs it not heartening that there are others of the opposite gender who see that the world is so broken that they, too, would rather have no part? The spirit that you all share, the one that sees the fissures in society, is the same spirit that made the pilgrims great (and boring and fearful of change, but that's another chapter of the Great Cycle); it's what made them work hard and prize beauty and value chastity and love their community. \n\nImagine if you could say \"ugh, look at that overmachismatic braggadociobro, making pass after pass on that poor girl who wants none of it\", to a man, and have him say \"fuck, I know, that is disgusting. Let's mess with him\". Imagine if a man could say \"ugh, look at that welfare queen: 350 pounds of beta bait with two kids in tow. She's wearing a moo moo to wal mart. I wonder when the last day she worked was\", to you, and you could laugh and validate his perceptions somehow. \n\nThere are real issues you are both talking about, but because you blame people whom you have never met, by default, and an entire gender at that, it turns off half of anyone who you try to persuade, and furthers your sense of division. \n\n(gonna post this in MGTOW as well) \n\nWhat do you guys think?

We are starting this October with the winner of this month's poll,  \n\n# Live Alone and Like It: The Classic Guide for the Single Woman\n\nby Marjorie Hillis\n\n>\\[The\\] archly funny, gently prescriptive manifesto   for single women. Though it was 1936 when the Vogue editor first shared   her wisdom with her fellow singletons, the tome has been passed   lovingly through the generations, and is even more apt today than when   it was first published. Hillis, a true bon vivant, was sick and tired of   hearing single women carping about their living arrangements and  lonely  lives; this book is her invaluable wake-up call for single women  to  take control and enjoy their circumstances.\n\nGet the book from the (online) bookshop or flea market of your choice (or look for a pdf online) and start reading :) \n\n**Please note that this thread is an announcement thread only**. I will post another thread mid October (see schedule below) for the book discussion. This gives us some time to read the book. Of course, you can always join the discussion later. In the meantime, you can use this thread to ask any questions. Suggestions for our very first book club discussion thread are welcome as well. So far, I thought I'd create a poll for us to rate the book and post some questions\/impulses for discussions. Any of your ideas are welcome as well. \n\n# Schedule: \n\nOctober, 15th: Discussion Thread \n\nOctober, 25th: Book suggestions for November start\n\nOctober, 28th: Poll for November\n\nNovember, 1st: Book for November will be announced","title":"WGTOW Book club: October: Book Announcement (+Schedule)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/j52f82\/wgtow_book_club_october_book_announcement_schedule\/"}

This is particularly evident in research on criminal women.\n\n>I definitely think the myth of women hating women is representative of the different standards used to police female social behaviour. The contemporary treatment of \u2018mean girls\u2019 as a new discovery or recent phenomena in particular seems to stem from an assumption of female passivity. Lyn Mikel Brown begins her book \u201cGirlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls\u201d by observing [ironically], \u201cNo more sugar and spice and everything nice. Suddenly the world is filled with mean and nasty girls.\u201d\n\n>It is also true that female intensity of any kind was historically viewed askance, especially when it came to female friendships. Strong emotion in women was read as evidence of a volatility that was then said to prevent long-lasting bonds between women. This became a convenient means by which to explain away examples of close female friendships.\n\n>Such relationships might occur, but were doomed to fail, claimed England\u2019s \u201cThe Saturday Review\u201d in 1866.  The paper declared that, in comparison to male friendships, female friendships were \u201cplunged into more rapidly; they are more vehement; but we doubt whether they are so deep or so lasting\u201d. The article was reprinted by the colonial press  and can be viewed here -http:\/\/trove.nla.gov.au\/ndp\/del\/article\/138049195\n\n>Female friendships were also perhaps subject to suspicion as an area of life outside male control. This could be dangerous, both men and women were warned. It could produce any number of terrible repercussions: from taking women\u2019s focus away from their families and household duties, to leading them to get drunk with their \u201cgossips\u201d (early modern term for female friend), or even (shock horror) encouraging them to do away with men altogether in favour of \u201csapphism\u201d.","title":"The Myth That Women Secretly Hate Other Women Has a Long History","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/6vs717\/the_myth_that_women_secretly_hate_other_women_has\/"}

It was hard to read honestly, because it describes a lot of the \"treatments\" women were put through for \"crimes\" such as talking back to their husbands. But the part that stood out to me because of how distubing the implications were, was this:\n\n\n\"When radical feminist women such as Phyllis Chesler entered the field of psychiatry, they were horrified at what they found. And at what they didn\u2019t find. After taking advanced degrees in the subject, Chesler realized that she had learned nothing about how to ease a person\u2019s suffering. Over the course of the past thirty years women have painstakingly overhauled the entire profession.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/radicalhubarchives.wordpress.com\/2012\/09\/26\/the-case-for-the-sanity-of-women\/#more-8445\n\n\nThat to me was one of the most horrifying parts because it revealed that the men in that profession weren't interested in easing peoples suffering or helping people get better. They were just observing people. Not helping them. Observing them and experimenting on them like zoo animals with no intention to rehabilitate them or improve the quality of their lives. It wasn't until women entered the field that they decided to try to help these people. Ugh. To be honest I was surprised but not that surprised, you know? After all, men are the ones responsible for almost all rape, murder, pedophilia, torture, war, I could go on... So they obviously feel a whole lot less empathy for people than women do. Did anyone see that video recently of a bunch of teenage boys watching and laughing (and filming!) a disabled man drowning right in front of them? I tried, I really tried but I just cannot imagine a group of girls doing that. Even the meanest girls I can imagine would not laugh and mock a person dying in front of them.\n\n\nAnyway, I always find it interesting when men talk about the men of the past as unenlightened brutes who somehow stumbled upon the fact that they were hurting women and children and stopped on their own accord when it's painfully obvious that they'd still be acting that way (and many still are!) if women hadn't fought so hard for their independence. Feminists basically forced mens hand and now they have to pretend to be sweet and caring in order to get their penises touched. I can't say I don't think that's fucking funny. Because it is. But it's still an act and I'm not buying it.\n\nThank god at least in some parts of the world today women don't have to depend on men. Imagine having to marry a man before they had to pretend to not be monsters. Ugh. No wonder women needed \"psychiatry\".\n\nAppologies if this doesn't belong here, I just thought it might be interesting topic to discuss.\n\n","title":"Men and psychiatry","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/6tygft\/men_and_psychiatry\/"}

Men constantly complain that they have to pay for dates. This may be true for the first few dates but after that usually it is split, and this was true for my friends as well. \n\nWhat many people don't think about is how expensive it is for a woman to prepare for a date and to make herself look good in order to attract men. The cost of makeup, moisturizer, hair product, and so forth is significant, and buying the latest clothes to look good is not cheap either. \n\nAfter going WGTOW, I saved up a considerable amount of money because I started researching minimalism and began living a minimalist life. Without the need to socialise, I moved in with my mother. I invested my money in low cost Vanguard index funds, and now I am investing in socially responsible index funds. \n\nSome of my friends have married, but many of them have children and need to stay home, which means they lose out on building up their skills thereby making them financially dependent on the man. If they divorce, they will struggle to find a job, which means they are trapped. \n\nSome argue that if a woman divorces a man, she can get half a man's wealth, but this assumes the man makes much money in the first place. The [gap between rich and poor has been rising dramatically] (https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/19\/business\/economy\/wealth-inequality-rising-fast-oxfam-says-faulting-tax-havens.html) since the 1970s, so either you take a huge risk and spend immense amounts of money trying to marry a billionaire (you spend a lot because you're competing against so many other women) or you end up settling and marrying someone average, and if you marry an average man, the costs of a mortgage, children, and family in general will deplete wealth. \n\nHad a woman simply stopped trying to appease men, focused on herself, lived a minimalist life, and invested her money wisely, she'd be on a sure road to freedom, happiness, and wealth. \n\nBeing able to save up more money means you become financially independent earlier in life.

They stay in my parents house which is in little town of my country. For 1 yr and a half I lived in the capital city for work but with pandemic I started working remotely so ever since I only go to the city sometimes. I rent a room in a shared apt because I have a good rental agreement and its better than having to do Airbnb because I can leave a couple of things there.\n\nIn my little town I am mostly an hermit. I work, study, go to the gym but I don't have friends or do social things. The only people I interact is an old couple who is friends with my family, their daughters when they come here, the lady from the supermarket and bakery when I go there. I am not close to my extended family and sometimes there's conflicts with my parents, lately it has been calm but I don't have a close relationship. It's a peaceful predictable lifestyle (except for the conflicts) but a few weeks with that I feel like my mental health declines. In the city I have a more active lifestyle with meetups, like minded \"friends\" (most are acquaintances), dinners, cinema, so I feel more energized. I can't yet afford a place big enough to take my dog with me so its out of the question to move there permanently again without him since now he is older. \n\nWhen he passes I feel I have no reason to stay in my town anymore specially because the house will be full of memories. I also have a brother and he has a gf. He is younger but probably in a couple of years will want to have kids and need the house for that. I don't want to share the house with a couple with kids and lose my peace tbh. I also don't want to become caretaker for my elder parents, they are hard people now, imagine when they are older, retired and with dementia kicking in. I also don't have caretaker instinct and they never took good care of me and even said my brother would inherit the house (that they didn't work to build, they just inherited it too) so yeah he should be the one taking care of them then. \nI dread what I will do with my life when I no longer have my dog. Right now even though I am objectively a loner, I don't feel alone. I feel balanced and at peace, there's a purpose in things, I don't feel the need to have a relationship or anything. But when he is gone then what? I thought of travelling or moving to a foreign country but I don't know if I will have the energy for that. I don't think I will want to adopt a pet until I have a house of my own and more free time to dedicate. \n\nPeople who don't have pets or kids, how do you bring purpose to your days?","title":"Not sure what I will do when my dog passes away","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/1953b98\/not_sure_what_i_will_do_when_my_dog_passes_away\/"}

Get out!!\" It was followed by lots of derisive laughter from customers (all either black or brown) and salesmen (all men). The area is heavily Hispanic and black, though not all. Xfinity has a monopoly on internet in this area.

I've been self improving since. It started in the summer when I noticed there were some decently attractive men that fit what I'd usually go for, but oddly, I wasn't feeling any attraction or desire for them. Ive had a lot of lousy dating experiences which has definitely soured my tastes. Anytime I gave a man a chance or he seemed lovely, he quickly reverted into acting like a toddler. I always seem to attract the guys that just want me to mother them - pay for them, tell them how to dress\/shop for them, run their errands, cook and clean for them, keep their schedule for them, some guys even asked me to call them to wake them up like I'm am alarm clock! This was all in the <3months in phase too! Its turned me all the way off. Even when I see photos of ripped supermodel guys or Thor I don't feel attracted to them at all. I just imagine that they all revert to the same mommas boy type.\n\nMy mom was pushing a military guy on me for a while, she was begging me to meet up with him and give him a chance. After telling her numerous times I wasn't interested, she then decided to start making excuses for his poor behavior. My sister did some digging on him and found out he trash talks his ex on social media, still has photos of her though, made racist comments, and was making a mockery of mental health issues. My mom still tried to defend him and make excuses for him! I was appalled! She started talking to my father about what's wrong with me and why won't I put myself out there anymore. I was fed up with being lied to, cheated on, used, stood up, and having my mental health and energy drained from my past dates. \nThen my mom started saying I'm depressed and should see a doctor. Then all the adds started coming to me for vitamins and pills that are supposed to help with libido. \n\nit feels like my mom us just trying to shame me and get me to settle for any man because she wants grandkids. \n\nI just don't have any attraction to men and haven't for a few months. Maybe I'm asexual or maybe I'm depressed or just stressed out trying to get my life together more. The more I reflect about dating I see the patterns and feel hopeless. I honestly have the attitude that guys are usually bad in bed or selfish and never even try for my pleasure or just whine about using protection, I really think that if I get an urge a vibrator is the best thing its clean, not selfish, and doesn't demand head in return for anything. Ive put myself out there, gave men chances, ive followed the infamous dating advice sub I won't mention here designed for female benefit and ive even asked guys for advice, ive tried and tried and tried and they all boil down to toddlers that expect me to mother them. Theres no point to dating and no point for marriage for me i feel like I'd have more mess and stress to deal with as a result. \n\nI dont feel any attraction to women either I never have so maybe I've become asexual now? Whatever is going on im tired of the backlash from others and being treated like I'm broken. I think its a blessing right now not to have urges or desire for a man - after all they only cost me so much of my time, money, energy, and I ended up in therapy so many times trying to get over these guys. I really just want to get my own house one day and have my sister come live with me she's a lesibian and always says she feels bad and can't imagine dating men as she's seen how awful my dad has been to my mom, the guys have been to me, and already how men are breaking her friends hearts and she can't understand why women allow themselves to be treated so poorly when the guy doesn't even celebrate a birthday or anniversary.","title":"Wondering if I am asexual or just so disappointed from my past relationships, but I don't find men (or anyone) attractive anymore?

It's where a man tries to get a date with a woman they see as overweight or unattractive for a joke. She told ITV's that when she arrived to meet Dutch student Jesse Mateman, he failed to turned up and texted her to say \"You were pigged\". He denies playing the prank and says he has been \"affected\" by the allegation. It was in August that Sophie, 24 from Stoke-on-Trent, claims she met Jesse while visiting Barcelona. Describing it as a holiday romance, she told This Morning: \"We spent every day together, went to the beach, hung out while we were away.\" After getting home from Barcelona, Sophie says they continued chatting everyday and talked about a long-distance relationship. It was then that Sophie claims the pair arranged for her to visit Jesse in Amsterdam. But when Sophie arrived, Jesse wasn't there. Sophie claims she waited at the airport for two-and-a-half hours until she found out it was a prank. \"Then I opened the message and it said 'You've been pigged'. \"Two pig emojis. It's all been a joke. Two laughing faces. \"I just replied saying 'How can you be so cruel though?' and then he just blocked me.\"\nIf you go to the comment section on Facebook below this article you\u00b4ll find the majority of men cheering, laughing or insulting her, victim blaming included of course.\nThey show no compassion. At all.","title":"Man humiliates woman through \"pull a pig\" prank now cries about the \"witch-hunt\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/75sx01\/man_humiliates_woman_through_pull_a_pig_prank_now\/"}

Most men seem to only want to have sex all the time. Then there are all the PUAs and TRPs out there who try to dominate you because they think you will love them more if they put you down. It's all quite exhausting.\n\nThen there is the problem of so many men having little respect for women, that women are just slaves who should do the cooking and household tasks, and that women love to be \"grabbed by the pussy\". So many manospherians believe these ideas, so they will try to grope women and touch them (they call it \"kino\").\n\nAfter a while, I came to realise that I got more happiness from simply staying home and reading or watching Netflix or YouTube compared to dating men. I even enjoy catching up with good female friends.

I don't usually have problems with men, only when it turns romantic do the problems arise. (For context, I am not american, from what I read online the impression I get is that men there are a bit depraved, here you can socialize with them). \n\nMy biggest trouble is to find like minded friends, people who share the same lifestyle and life goals, who are in the same location as me. For example, one of my goals is to buy property. I  also work in IT and miss chatting with people who also work in the area to share my struggles. So yeah, most people who share that with me are men. Of course there's more men in IT, the few women who are in IT that I know seem to be in a rush to get married\/have kids (cannot relate with that) and they don't prioritize career growth or travelling, they prioritize stability and family. Single women who want to buy a house alone? You can forget about that, I don't know a single woman who has that goal. I met some interesting people on my vacations, but they don't live here, then they went to their home countries. \n\n\nI basically only have few friends, one of them is a guy but has a gf so not always available, another is a guy but he is a bit unreliable (says he wants to go to X but then shows up late or changes his mind and he is always complaining) and a girl which actually shares some of wgtow values, but for example she doesn't have the same travelling habits as me (likes to stay in expensive places, I prefer hostels) and makes me uncomfortable sometimes because she is bisexual. But mostly I cannot understand her way of living, because she is so careless with money and with planning stuff. I don't say anything or make negative remarks obviously, but sometimes it bothers me on small stuff like she lives here for a while and still didn't manage to get a phone data plan to get mobile data so she doesn't have access to google maps or uber app, stuff like that. Also she makes really low money and spends tons of money in stuff like uber, and stingy me is like \"omg, i make double of what she makes and I never spend money on uber\" . Anyway, those are minor things, she cares about different stuff than me, it's fine, its just that we cannot relate on having the same life goals. \n\nWhen I travel i meet people who also love travelling and stuff, but they're all obsessed with weed and alcohol. For me it's fine if they do it, but they are like really obsessed, like they have to smoke in every social occasion and all they do is partying, they don't do hikes, cinema, museums, so not shared ground to work with. \n\nI think the most like minded person who I met was my only ex bf, who was a digital nomad (loved travelling), but didn't do any drugs, childfree, worked in IT and was fucking stingy with money like me. But of course it all turned to shit due to the romantic component, so I don't even keep in touch. So a man and he was in his 40s, says a lot, the only person I could relate was a man in his 40s, the fuck :\/ \n\nAnyway, just a rant. Sometimes I wonder how my future is going to be like and I think I am just going to be alone the rest of my life. I sometimes even try to tell stuff to my mom, but it never works out, she is a narcisistic and just toxic, automatically yells, insults me, puts me down, wants me to fail, etc. \n\nI feel like I am too materialistic to bond with people with alternative ways of life (I am very career and money driven, want to buy land, dislike irresponsible ways of living as in having zero source of income and spending all the time partying and doing drugs) but I am not conservative enough to bound with people with traditional life paths (do not want kids or to get married, like to travel around, hate prejudiced close minded people, dislike religion)","title":"Frustrated about my social life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/pb7wqd\/frustrated_about_my_social_life\/"}

As a kid I was always determined never to have men in my life, but something went really wrong in my twenties. I basically spent ten years straight bouncing from man to man, seeking validation I never quite got. I got engaged twice, and was in multiple long-term relationships, some in parallel while cheating. Now, at 29, I have finally broken free from years of my own and others' toxicity. Since a year or so, I no longer feel the urge to talk to men or seek their attention and I am convinced a man cannot add value to my life in any meaningful way that I can't do for myself. I have broken off my second engagement and decided never to give it a shot again, I simply do not want to get stuck with a man in marriage.\n\nHowever, partly because I am surrounded EXCLUSIVELY by married folks... I find myself dealing with quite a bit of pressure and comments intended to make me doubt my decision. My question is, **what do I need to do in order to live my best life without ever relying on or including a man in my life? What do I need to know right now, while I am young, to ensure I am successful at this? I am not based in the US, so any advice will need to take that into account.** I am based in a conservative, Muslim country.\n\nI am already working at saving (I only invest in precious metals for now, but I am trying to get into real estate), being my healthiest and fittest self possible, and working on\/investing in my hobbies. I am failing at relationships in general; I try my best to have a \"community\" but over the last five years I have basically lost all female friendships to marriage -- I live in a society where, even now, and at least in my circle, women don't really prioritize female friendships or they prefer friends living close by who can discuss marriage + babies. Most women also get married in their twenties. I increasingly feel the need to have a gun\/weapon with me for safety (however, I would probably feel the same way if I was stuck with a man, they are utterly useless and in my experience can barely take care of a lizard or rodent). What else do I need to think about and focus on?\n\n(Sorry about the ranty nature of this post. I am making this post while realizing how badly I want to travel this year and how limited my options are simply because I am a single woman from a conservative background.

Her father was a prosperous farmer. As a teenager, Barton helped care for her seriously ill brother David\u2014her first experience as a nurse.\n\nBarton\u2019s family directed their painfully shy daughter to become a teacher upon the recommendation of renowned phrenologist L.N. Fowler, who examined her as a girl. She began teaching at age 18, founded a school for workers\u2019 children at her brother\u2019s mill when she was 24, and after moving to Bordentown, New Jersey, established the first free school there in 1852. She resigned when she discovered that the school had hired a man at twice her salary, saying she would never work for less than a man.\n\nIn 1854 she was hired as a recording clerk at the US Patent Office in Washington, DC, the first woman appointed to such a post. She was paid $1,400 annually, the same as her male colleagues. However, the following year, Secretary of the Interior Robert McClelland, who opposed women working in government, reduced her to copyist with a lower salary. In 1857, the Buchanan Administration eliminated her position entirely, but in 1860, she returned as copyist after the election of President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhen the Civil War began in 1861, Barton quit her job and made it her mission to bring supplies to Union soldiers in need\u2014among them, men of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry. This started a life-long career of aiding people in times of conflict and disaster. In 1862, she received official permission to transport supplies to battlefields and was at every major battle in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, where she also tended to the wounded and became known as the \u201cangel of the battlefield.\u201d She was officially named head nurse for one of General Benjamin Butler\u2019s units in 1864, even though she had no formal medical training. She joined Frances Gage in helping to prepare slaves for their lives in freedom. After the war, Barton helped locate missing soldiers, mark thousands of graves, and testified in Congress about her wartime experiences.\n\nIn 1869, Barton traveled through Europe to regain her health. While in Switzerland, she learned about the International Red Cross, established in Geneva in 1864. Returning to the US, Barton built support for the creation of an American society of the Red Cross by writing pamphlets, lecturing, and meeting with President Rutherford B. Hayes. On May 21, 1881, the American Association of the Red Cross was formed; Barton was elected president in June. In 1882, the US joined the International Red Cross.\n\nBarton remained with the Red Cross until 1904, attending national and international meetings, aiding with disasters, helping the homeless and poor, and writing about her life and the Red Cross. She was also an ardent supporter of women\u2019s suffrage. In 1904, she established the National First Aid Association of America, an organization that emphasized emergency preparedness and developed first aid kits. Her Glen Echo, Maryland home became a National Historic Site in 1975, the first dedicated to the achievements of a woman.","title":"Clara Barton (1821-1912) (WGHOW)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/nfiand\/clara_barton_18211912_wghow\/"}

Anthony was a prominent American suffragist and civil rights activist. She campaigned against slavery and for women to be given the vote. She was the co-founder of the Women\u2019s Temperance movement which campaigned to tighten up laws on alcohol. She played a significant role in raising the profile of equal rights for women and is credited with playing a significant role in the passing of the nineteenth amendment (1920) which gave women the vote.\n\n\u201cMen their rights and nothing more, women their rights and nothing less.\u201d\n\u2013 Motto of the \u2018Revolution\u2019 Journal 1868\u20131870\n\nSusan was born 15th February 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. Her parents were Quakers and activists in the anti-slavery movement. Susan was brought up in a strict Quaker climate, which emphasised concern for others, self-discipline and living a principled life. She later dropped organised religion, describing herself as an agnostic. But she retained many of the Quaker principles she was brought up with.\n\nFrom an early age, Anthony was a keen student, and when her school wouldn\u2019t teach her long division because of her gender, her father taught her at home. She became well educated at a time when it was not common for women to be educated.\n\nIn 1837, her family was hard hit financially by the great financial panic of 1837. In the next few years, Anthony worked as a teacher, scraping a living and helping her father to pay off his debts. By 1846, she had become headmistress at Canajoharie Academy; her work as a teacher encouraged her to campaign for equal pay for women teachers who, at the time, were paid considerably less than men.\n\nIn 1846, she left teaching and moved to the family farm in Rochester, New York. After retiring from teaching, she spent more time campaigning on political issues. She was closely involved in the local temperance movement \u2013 a movement campaigning about the evils of alcohol and for stricter legislation. She was also active in the anti-slavery movement, collecting petitions against slavery and delivering them to Congress. Overcoming a shyness about public speaking, Susan became a prominent public figure in the anti-slavery and Temperance movement.\n\nOnce a petition was rejected because the petition contained mainly women\u2019s and children\u2019s signatures. This encouraged Anthony to give more importance to gaining the vote for women. Without equal voting rights, she felt her campaigns against alcohol abuse were too easily dismissed. Also, in 1850, she read a speech by Lucy Stone from the Women\u2019s Rights Convention, which inspired her to devote herself to the cause.\nOver the next few years, she became more involved and committed to the women\u2019s suffrage movement. She met fellow women\u2019s suffrage leaders, such as Amelia Bloomer and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\n\nFrom an early age, Anthony had also followed her family in supporting the end of slavery and giving equal rights to people of color. In 1856 Anthony worked as a very successful agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society. She pioneered effective methods of canvassing and was willing to arrange meetings, make speeches \u2013 despite widespread hostility. In Syracuse, New York, she was even hung in effigy. She later saw an opportunity to unite the women\u2019s struggle with the civil rights struggle.\n\n\u201cWhere, under our Declaration of Independence, does the Saxon man get his power to deprive all women and Negroes of their inalienable rights?\u201d\n\nThe Revolution, Susan B. Anthony c. 1855\n\nHowever, in 1869, she felt let down when the American Equal Rights Association dropped their support for women\u2019s suffrage and the 13th amendment just focused on giving black men the vote and not women. After this disappointment, she began to focus more on gaining women the vote.\n\nIn 1869, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). The organization was dedicated to gaining women the vote. Anthony served as vice-president to Stanton. Anthony frequently sought to make alliances with the many other disparate women\u2019s suffragist groups. This was often at odds with Stanton who was keener on taking a more independent hardline approach. However, Anthony felt the women\u2019s message would be stronger if they spoke with one voice and didn\u2019t appear divided. In February 1890, against the resistance of Stanton and some members, Anthony orchestrated the merger of the NWSA with Lucy Stone\u2019s more moderate American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), creating the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).\n\n\u201cHere, in the first paragraph of the Declaration, is the assertion of the natural right of all to the ballot; for how can \u201cthe consent of the governed\u201d be given, if the right to vote be denied?\u201d\n\n\u2013 On the United States Declaration of Independence in her \u201cIs It a Crime for a Citizen of the United States to Vote?\u201d speech before her trial for voting. (1873)\n\nIn 1868, Anthony began publishing a weekly journal: The Revolution. The journal advocated equal rights for women and negroes. It called for women to be given the vote and universal civil rights. She also extended the range of issues to tackle problems such as equal pay and divorce law. She was willing to take on unpopular issues and challenge the prevailing customs and beliefs of the day.\n\n\u201cCautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can bring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing to be anything or nothing in the world\u2019s estimation.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Susan B.Anthony, On the Campaign for Divorce Law Reform (1860)\nHowever, with a policy of paying high wages, and a very strict approach to adverts (rejecting alcohol and morphine-based drugs), the paper incurred large debts, and it was only able to struggle on for two more years, finally closing in 1872.\n\nIn 1868 the US Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment which guaranteed equal rights to all citizens \u2013 making no reference to gender.\n\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d (14th Amendment, 1868)\nOn November 1872, Anthony voted in the US Presidential election, arguing this amendment gave her a constitutional right to vote. However, two weeks later she was arrested. At her trial, the judge, Justice Hunt, denied her the right to testify, then told the jury to give a guilty verdict and read an opinion he had written before the trial. She was given a $100 fine.\n\nHowever, in protest at the unjust trial, she refused to pay the $100 fine and interrupted the judge as he was speaking. The trial was a major landmark; her cause appeared reasonable, and her treatment unfair. The government, embarrassed by the trial, never pressed her to pay the fine, and she walked free. She said at the end of the trial:\n\u201cMay it please your honour, I will never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty.\u2026 And I shall earnestly and persistently continue to urge all women to the practical recognition of the old Revolutionary maxim, \u201cResistance to tyranny is obedience to God.\u201d\n\nHer trial increased her profile, and she embarked on a national speaking programme to raise funds and spread her message of supporting equal rights for women.\nAnthony retired from active political activity in 1900 and died of heart disease and pneumonia in New York, 1906. Fourteen years after Anthony\u2019s death, women\u2019s right to vote was guaranteed by the Nineteenth Amendment (1920).\n\nAchievements of Susan B. Anthony: \nWith Elizabeth Cady Stanton, founded the National Woman\u2019s Suffrage Association NWSA in 1869. She was president until 1900.\n\nPublished \u201cThe Revolution\u201d from 1868-1870 which campaigned for women and civil rights.\nWrote the Susan B. Anthony Amendment in 1878 which later became the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote.\n\nFirst person to be arrested and be put on trial for voting in Nov. 1872.\nShe refused to pay \u201ca dollar of your unjust penalty.\u201d\n\nEdited \u201cThe History of Woman Suffrage (4 vols. 1881-1902) with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage.\n\nFounded the International Council of Women (1888) and the International Woman Suffrage Council (1904)\nGave 75-100 speeches a year for 45 years, travelling throughout the United States by stagecoach, wagon, carriage and train.\n\nCampaigned for women to learn self-reliance and self-confidence.\n\u201cWoman must not depend upon the protection of man, but must be taught to protect herself.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Speech in San Francisco (July 1871).\nCitation: Pettinger, Tejvan. \u201cBiography of Susan B. Anthony \u201c, Oxford, UK. www.biographyonline.net \u2013 4th Feb. 2013. Updated 12 September 2017\n\nQuotes of Susan B. Anthony: \n\n\u201cThe true woman will not be an exponent of another or allow another to be such for her. She will be her own individual self\u2026 Stand or fall by her own individual wisdom and strength\u2026 She will proclaim the \u201cglad tidings of good news\u201d to all women, that woman equally with man was made for her own individual happiness, to develop\u2026 every talent given to her by God, in the great work of life.\u201d\n\nStatement of Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1856), partially quoted in The Right to Vote (2001) by Claudia Isler, p. 50, and in Perfecting the Family: Antislavery Marriages in Nineteenth-Century America (1997) by Chris Dixon, p. 144\n\u201cThe one distinct feature of our Association has been the right of the individual opinion for every member. We have been beset at every step with the cry that somebody was injuring the cause by the expression of some sentiments that differed with those held by the majority of mankind. The religious persecution of the ages has been done under what was claimed to be the command of God. I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do to their fellows because it always coincides with their own desires.\u201d\n\nA defence of Elizabeth Cady Stanton against a motion to repudiate her Woman\u2019s Bible at a meeting of the National-American Woman Suffrage Association 1896 Convention, HWS, IV (1902), p. 263\n\n\u201cit will come, but I shall not see it\u2026It is inevitable. We can no more deny forever the right of self-government to one-half our people than we could keep the Negro forever in bondage. It will not be wrought by the same disrupting forces that freed the slave but come it will, and I believe within a generation.\u201d Harper (1908), Vol. 3, p. 1259\n\n\u2013 Susan B. Anthony asked shortly before her retirement if women would ever see the time when they were given the vote.","title":"Susan B.

They tell you its because they're in love.","title":"Couples who get together for financial reasons","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/ubjkrg\/couples_who_get_together_for_financial_reasons\/"}

I love to be on my own and crave alone time to recharge, even from people I love and care about. I need long walks in the woods, me and my dogs, and time to do things on my own. I have many hobbies and passions that I like to do on my own \u2013 sometimes with company for sure, but often not. I think I might very well be semi asexual, I have had partners but never felt I needed them to be happy.\n\nI never wanted children of my own, but I am a proud and loving aunt, cheering on my niblings as they move forward in life. I always felt a lot of gratitude for being born healthy and in a rich and safe country, and have never had to fight depression or anxiety.\n\nNow to my problem. There is a close friend, my best friend and confidant for most of my life, who recently went through a strange break up. She was\/is in love with a man who is from another country and who had been forced to marry another woman by his family. He has accepted this faith but she feels like her life is ending because of this.\n\nI have tried my best to be a good friend, I check in with her daily, cook for her and her kid so she won\u2019t have to, offer company if desired and bring little gifts to show that I think of her. Tonight we had a long talk and I know that she is missing this man and that they had something special, but I also know that he did things in their relationship that I would not have been able to see past and forgive. But she can not see those parts. Then she tells me that if she didn\u2019t have a kid she would end her life. Over this man, who agreed to marry someone else without putting up a fight.\n\nThen she proceeds to tell me that life without a partner and children is empty any meaningless and she would rather die than have it that way. So I ask her, does she view my life as meaningless and empty? Turns out she does. But she also points out that I am happy with my life, but that it is not something that she would be happy with. Fair enough. But I also feel a bit disappointed that I\u2019m not worth staying around for but this man is. A man that forced her to abort a child she wanted, who didn\u2019t keep his promises, who drank too much and slept all day. He did absolutely have very good traits too, I admit as much. But still. Ouch. I realized today that I value her much more than she ever did me. I guess at least I know that now.\n\nI might add, I have my own sorrows in life at the moment, but did she ask even once about it? No, not in several months, and I know she would have if she had not been so deep in her own misery to notice but then at least don\u2019t tell me my life is worthless.\n\nI feel a little sad tonight, that others view my life as without meaning. I thought about it, and I truly don\u2019t. I know that I have made a difference in the lives of others, and it makes me smile. I sponsor a child in Guinea Bissau, who can go to school because of that. I volunteer at an animal shelter and give my time to any of my friends who need a good listener. I work as an emergency nurse, and have helped saved a life or two in my day. Besides, who decides what is considered meaningful?\n\nSorry for the rant, just needed to get it off my chest. And also sorry for my English \u2013 am currently sipping some wine and my brain is pleasantly relaxed \u2026\n\nhope you are all having a great day\/night, sisters","title":"Best friend told me my life is meaningless","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wgtow\/comments\/151ib0r\/best_friend_told_me_my_life_is_meaningless\/"}

Let me explain.\n\nI\u2019m antinatalist, personally. So, even when I pictured my \u201cperfect\u201d little hetero family, I always thought I would adopt (because I figure antinatalism is still relatively niche and there will still always be people having children they can\u2019t or don\u2019t care for, and who need a home and love) my kids (girls) and they would be *my* kids, then my husband would be my husband who could, in a sense, be their dad but they\u2019d legally be my kids. Like I was never comfortable with some dude having a 50% say in what I did or where I went with my children. \n\nAnd I knew that even if there were a situation where I had adopted my girls before I met the guy and he asked to legally adopt them, I\u2019d have said no \ud83d\ude2d.
