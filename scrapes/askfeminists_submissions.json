I'm an autistic woman myself and I would never claim that neurodivergence is easy for *anyone* to deal with.\n\n\nI've come across a lot of high functioning autistic men who have virtually no social skills. I've come across much less high functioning autistic women who are the same way. By this, I mean they would struggle exponentially to function in a workplace or university environment.  \n\n\nMy experiences obviously don't dictate the way the world works, but I've done some research and it seems like this isn't something I made up. \n\n\nWhat I really have noticed is the self-absorption of some autistic men. Most autistic women I know struggle with asserting themselves, having self-esteem, and validating their own feelings. However, autistic men tend not to struggle with asserting themselves, leading me to believe that they have been taking much more seriously. \n\n\nThis could be argued as a lack of empathy, but empathy is just one part of being a considerate person. Being able to recognize that you would dislike to be treated one way, so you shouldn't treat another person that way is not beyond the mental capacity of a high functioning autistic person. Not doing this means you are deliberately choosing not to...or that you weren't taught to care how you impact others because you have a \"pass\"--this is what I believe causes so many autistic men to be so self-absorbed.\n\n\nI have a personal anecdote. I'm 18 and I befriended an autistic man the same age. He would frequently send me videos about topics I knew nothing about. I clarified that I really didn't know anything about these topics, but I was willing to learn about them. Part of this was me being polite because I was *forced* to learn these social norms, or I was *punished harshly* for not meeting the massively high standard for social decorum for women. \n\n\nHowever, the one time I sent him a silly online quiz about a history topic I thought was interesting, he directly told me that he thought it was pointless. He didn't understand why I would send him something he wasn't interested in. I had to explain to him, at the age of 18, that what he sent me was equally pointless from my perspective, so why was he complaining about something he did to me? \n\n\nIt didn't even occur to him that I was just doing the same thing. He was completely empowered to tell me that my interests were pointless. He didn't think for a moment that maybe, considering how I was kind to him about his interests, he should at least not\ncomment rudely on mine. Unconsciously, the dynamic he demanded was one where I tolerated all of his interests, but he tolerated none of mine. No on ever taught him that friendships were mutual--on the other hand, I was treated like an anomaly just for *having* unconventional interests, and no one babied me into thinking that I was allowed to ramble forever without considering others.\n\n\nMy question is: have other feminists observed this? To NT women as well, how frequently have you been judged for your interests by men who expect you to listen to theirs?","title":"Have you found that neurodivergent men tend to be given a pass for their behavior, where autistic women aren't?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1biqmjf\/have_you_found_that_neurodivergent_men_tend_to_be\/"}

So how come nobody calls them out for being misogynistic towards women and upholding patriarchal mindsets? How come people don\u2019t talk about how Black men have excluded Black women from liberation and have subjugated us just like white women did? Its like people are rightfully enraged when white feminists are exclusionary in their movements but there is no such energy when Black men are killing us at alarming rates.\n\nIts almost as if there is this mindset that white women are just as privledged as White men and Black men and women are equally disadvantaged which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.

But in practice, it just feels like a flipped version of the old \u201cnice guys vs. bad boys\u201d narrative. Instead of \u201cbad boys get the girls,\u201d it becomes \u201cgood feminist allies get the girls.\u201d The core idea stays the same: a man\u2019s value is determined by how successful he is with women.\n\nThis framing treats romantic relationships like a moral reward system\u2014if you\u2019re good, you get love; if you\u2019re bad, you don\u2019t. But dating isn\u2019t a meritocracy. It\u2019s shaped by so many things\u2014timing, luck, social skills, class, appearance, mental health\u2014and not always within anyone\u2019s control.\n\nWhen it comes to incels or socially isolated men, a lot of people reduce their loneliness to personality flaws: \u201cOf course he\u2019s single\u2014just look at how he acts.\u201d But that logic ignores the circularity of the situation. Often, the behaviour people criticize is the *result* of years of rejection, isolation, and unmet emotional needs. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle. And let\u2019s be honest\u2014there are plenty of abusive, manipulative, or misogynistic men who still have partners. So clearly, being a \u201cbad person\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically make someone undatable.\n\nThe idea that people get what they deserve in love is comforting because it implies the world is fair. But in reality, love and connection often hinge more on luck, privilege, and circumstance than moral character. Many people are single not because they\u2019re bad, but because they\u2019re shy, awkward, struggling financially, or dealing with trauma. Sometimes, it\u2019s just bad luck.\n\nThe deeper issue here is that this way of thinking doesn\u2019t actually challenge toxic masculinity\u2014it just rebrands it. It still measures a man\u2019s worth by how attractive or desirable he is. It just uses progressive language to decide who \"deserves\" to feel worthy. That\u2019s not liberation\u2014it\u2019s just a reshuffling of the same hierarchy.\n\nI think part of this comes from how some modern feminism, especially online, leans heavily on the idea that all harmful behaviour is learned and can be unlearned. That\u2019s a powerful concept, but it often overlooks the fact that things like the desire for love, the pain of rejection, and the need to feel seen are not always learned\u2014they\u2019re just human. And when men express these feelings\u2014especially if they do it awkwardly, or outside socially approved norms\u2014they\u2019re often treated as threats rather than people in pain.\n\nThere seems to be little room for men to express vulnerability without being judged.

Behaviors like\n\n\n1. Ignoring everyone who isn't a woman. Like completely silent until a woman speaks and then glomming on to what she says. It's made a few women feel uncomfortable. \n\n\n2. Trying to constantly engage with women in the group who preferred not to be engaged with by them. \n\n3. Constantly looking for dates. We have a strong rule about asking nobody out ever, but they'll try to find ways to break it and say \"I mean I didn't think of it as a date\". \n\n\n4. They just give of strange vibes. Doing things like staring a little too long, making comments that aren't necessarily something you can say \"that's wrong wtf\" but you can say \"That's ...weird of you to say\". \n\n5. Getting upset at women specifically about rejection and then coming to me to complain about how the women are being ableist. And then when I get the other side of the story I'll find out they did something wildly inappropriate, it wasn't the woman being ableist. \n\n\n6. RP and incel talking points. I feel like whenever we have a group conversation about making friends or finding relationships as autistic people at least one new person will start talking about how women are evil, ableist, and the only reason they hate him is because he's short and oooh those feminists dont' forget about them. And then after they rant for a minute and you get what the gist is, you let someone else speak and go off to the side with them to say \"Get the fuck out of here\". Like this has happened every time these issues come up. One time I've had to kick out two of them at the same time because they were supporting each others crazy incel talking points. \n\nLike this is...continuous. Every single session one of the new autistic men (we have a core group of members and a large group of people who drop in for a session or two never to be seen again) will do something that makes one of the women say \"I don't want him here\" to me  (normally they're not that explicit, nobody wants to kick someone out) because they're doing something very creepy.\n\n\nWe eventually decided on a rule that everyone who comes in needs to grab a wrist band. Red if you don't want to be talked to\/approached and green if you don't want to be talked to\/approached.  \n\nAlthough the rule isn't actually real. We (the 3 of us leading the events) only enforce it to keep the autistic men from hitting on the women, the rule actually serves no other purpose. It's just there so that we can go up to the guy and say \"Hey look at her wristband, it's time for you to leave\" without them being able to rule lawyer us. We've never had to actually even think about the rule when it came to an autistic woman coming up to an autistic guy or two autistic women talking to each other, it's a rule that exists exclusively so that we can get the more creepy autistic guys out of there more quickly.  \n\nSo I'm not really sure what to do about these people in our ND group because even with this rule they still manage to, often, make the women there feel uncomfortable one way or another until someone complains to me and we make the offender leave. So that's part one.\n\nWhat should\/can we be doing better here? This is a question all on it's own, you can disregard the rest of the post. \n\n-------------------\n\nBut the second part is what is the non ableist feminist way to deal with autistic men in society? The behavior that these men in our meetup group exhibit are, visually, identitical to an actually dangerous or creepy guy even if they're actually not bad guys. But we know coming in that they might have autism so we might be a bit more accomidating.\n\nIn the real world how are autistic men supposed to be held to the same standards as everyone else in regular social situations? Or should \"He's autistic, it's not his fault\" be the default way to deal with certain behaviors among NT people? \n\n\nSo if someone is a woman what is a feminist inclusive response to the feeling \"Oh this person is giving me bad vibes\" while keeping in mind their autistic? \n\n\nFor me after having dealt with so much obstinance among autistic men who refuse to learn and how often it happens (I feel like we've kicked out or had to warn like more than 60% of the autistic men who come to out meetup group) I feel...very little sympathy.

Not to mention that women had no political power and therefore had no say in a war; they were never the instigators, yet weren\u2019t spared the effects of war- from being killed, raped, enslaved, losing their homes, families, finances, etc. And all too with the burden of caring for children dependent on them for basic necessities most of the time.\n\nBut the one very obvious and major reason for women not being expected to go to war seems to always go un-mentioned, even by educated feminists (from what I\u2019ve seen). That is that just as men risked their lives in war, mostly all women in history risked their lives producing human beings. \n\nIt was commonplace for women to die in childbirth before modern medicine. Even with modern medicine, maternal mortality rates are pretty high, including in developed countries, so one can only imagine what the rates were for most of human history. \n\nJust as with men and war, women were not given choice in the matter either. They were pregnant as a result of rape or because society expected them to get married and sleep with their husbands. There was not much a choice in a matter that ultimately risked their health and lives, with many, many dying as a result, often at a young age.\n\nI would guess even thousands of years ago, societies understood that it wouldn\u2019t make sense to expect women to be the sole sex that takes on the risk of pregnancy, commonly dying in childbirth, as well as be equal participants in fighting wars. You\u2019d have far higher rates of death among women than men if that happened, which would not only be unfair, but terrible for societies as a whole. \n\nSo, why is this never provided as the logical, obvious answer in these arguments? Anti-feminists very conveniently seem to forget that women had their own burden to bear as far as risking body & life was concerned and it doesn\u2019t seem to be talked about enough.","title":"How come child-birth is never brought up in the \u201cmen go to war\u201d arguments?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1cmise6\/how_come_childbirth_is_never_brought_up_in_the\/"}

So why is it that when they're down on their luck, men always turn to women for help? I can't count the amount of times on one hand that a man has walked past other men to approach me where I'm sitting to ask for food\/money or the times that I've walked past a man panhandling in a group of other people and they call out to me instead of any of the men that are walking by. I'm currently homeless myself and I guess I look like it because I've been discriminated against for it (businesses refusing to allow me to use their bathroom even though I'm a paying customer). It strikes me as odd that a man will sooner ask an obviously homeless woman for help before they ask a well-off looking man for help. They'd rather take money out of my pocket than another man's pocket. \n\nThis also goes for other forms of support besides financial. For example, emotional support. I've wasted dozens hours of my life playing therapist to many different men of different ages and relationship types, but no man has ever listened to me vent about my problems or feelings for even 30 seconds. In fact, they treated all my problems like a personal inconvenience to them. Yet those same men still claim to \"suffer in silence,\" so I've started to feel like my emotional labor was being taken advantage of and went unappreciated.\n\nIn my life, personally, men have only ever asked for my help and never offered any. It's strange to me considering the way they seem to disregard women in every other sense, but when they need something, the first person they go to is a woman. It makes me feel like men only value the worth of a woman when she has something they want to take from her and that makes me very sad. I want to be a true feminist and part of that is caring about men's issues and building bridges between genders, but I'm very reluctant to do so because the men I've known have only ever taken advantage of my doing so in the past.

But I constantly hear individuals who will say something that is clearly a social construct and often problematic, and then justify it with it's \u201c basic biology\u201d or \u201cits simple science\". For example was reading through another sub earlier today and someone said something along the lines that\n\n\u201cWomen want a man who can provide for them financially because back in our hunter-gather days men provided food for women. It is an indication of a good and successful partner. Women are gold diggers because it is ingrained in their DNA. It is basic biology\u201d.\n\nOr another I often hear, in a less tasteful example\n\n\u201cMen are attracted to younger women because they are more fertile and it is ingrained in men's biology to reproduce\u201d As an excuse for a 30 year old going after a teenager.\n\nI am reminded of the bias and unjust racial \u201cstudies\u201d during slavery and jim crow.

I don't really know what to title this post, and even if this is the right place to post, but I felt it could create a decent discussion.\n\nI'm a man in my mid-20s, and I've been sexually active for a few years. I recently read a thread on r\/ask titled \"How often do you get asked for consent as a man?\" and the answers - mostly in the vein of \"haha never\" got me thinking. And I honestly don't think that I have *ever* been explicitly asked for consent by a woman before or during a sexual encounter. I've always made sure to ask them for consent, but mine was sort of implied.\n\nThere have been a few times where I've just come out and said \"I'm not interested in sex right now\" or \"can we stop?\" and...well, it wasn't exactly well received. I vividly remember one woman asking, with all sincerity, if I was gay, and a couple of others started crying, which of course made me feel guilty and meant I had to comfort them. One woman who I was with a few months ago ignored me and, well, I've recently realised that she probably sexually assaulted me, though at the time I just went along with it - better to pretend to be into it than risk a negative reaction. But in hindsight, I feel quite violated and it's affecting me. \n\nI've talked to a few of my mates recently, and nearly all of them have agreed with me that they've hardly ever been asked for consent, if at all. The only ones who said they were asked for it are in long-term relationships, which I suppose does change the dynamic a bit. But the majority - never been asked. I asked a female friend of mine if she'd asked for consent, and she looked at me like I was an alien, before admitting that it had never occurred to her. She's lovely, and felt pretty guilty, so I'm hoping that it can lead to more positive interactions for her and her partners going forward. I'm sure that this isn't necessarily a universal thing (but hardly anything is), but it does seem to be a lot more common than I previously thought. \n\nSo why does this happen? I know there's an expectation that men always want sex - but, well, we don't. We're not machines. I've just been thinking - how nice would it be if a woman explicitly asked me for consent, to truly show that she wants me and cares about my feelings? Should women be taught consent as much as men are? (I don't know about other guys, but it was drilled into me from almost as soon as I knew what sex was - always, *always* ask for consent.) Consent goes both ways, and again, I ALWAYS make sure to ask my partners for consent. But, my past experiences have made me, frankly, too scared to say no again. If it does happen that I don't want sex, I'm debating whether to just say yes anyway, as it'd save a lot of hassle. I'm really not interested in comforting crying girls that I barely know if I say no. \n\nI'm sorry for the longish post, but I had a bit to get off my chest. I also apologise for using a new account, but my main is known by my family, and I'm not particularly keen for them to be aware of what I've said here. \n\nThank you for reading.","title":"Can I ask about women and consent?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1c8wiv9\/can_i_ask_about_women_and_consent\/"}

It's like, when people keep saying someone is a woman because they feel like one, does it kind of imply that there's a certain image or set of expectations that comes with being a woman that they're identifying with? It makes me think \u2013 isn't feminism about saying that women are all different and there's no single way to be one? Does focusing on someone becoming a woman almost suggest there is a mold?\n\nAnd another thing I've been mulling over is how a lot of feminist history has been about the shared experiences of people who were born female and the specific crap they've had to deal with because of that. When people broaden \"woman\" to include people who weren't born female, does that risk kind of blurring those lines or making it harder to talk about those specific, biological sex-based inequalities?\n\nIt almost feels like by constantly saying \"yep, they're women,\" people might be unintentionally agreeing that there's a \"woman\" club with certain rules, instead of just blowing up the whole idea of strict gender categories in the first place.\n\nLook, I really want to be supportive, and I believe in respecting people's identities.

I HAVE been thinking about this. A lot, in fact, and I can never put my finger on WHY I have this feeling. Hopefully someone can help me out.\n\nBasically, whenever I see a joke where the punchline contains a comparison between men and women, I can't shake the feeling that \"This is misogynistic\" and\/or like I'm looking at something insulting women, even if the joke effectively makes fun of- or insults the man.\n\n\\--\n\nMandatory exclaimers:\n\n* I'm not saying that jokes that compare men and women are inherently bad, not funny, or shouldn't exist.\n* I'm not saying that everything is objectively misogynistic.\n* I'm trying to figure out a feeling that I, personally have. PERSONALLY.\n* I do have a sense of humor. In fact, I often laugh at these jokes myself.\n\n  \n\\--\n\n\n\nI only have three hypotheses that I could've derived from academic papers I studied in the past:\n\n1. Comparisons between men and women have been done for sexist purposes for such a long time, any joke poking fun at \"differences\" might automatically feel sexist towards women even if that's not the intention.\n2. The jokes generally frame men as the funny ones, regardless of the setting. If a woman is doing something completely reasonable while the man is doing something stupid, then he's funny and she's boring. Women are framed as some kind of archetype of a \"proper adult\", while men are treated like carefree kids, making men more likeable.\n3. Men take pride in being bad at some things, especially if they're feminine coded. As such, the joke can't be insulting or negative towards men, because it's affirming of their masculinity. And the sexism towards women is then that they are used to amplify that sense of superiority for men (because masculinity is inherently seen as better that femininity).\n\n(Sidenote: The academic papers I'm referring to aren't saying those specific things. Rather, I'm wondering if the ideas COULD be derived from them).\n\n\\--\n\nAnyway, one example imo is this joke:\n\n**\"How women and men see colours\"**  \nFollowed by a woman able to identify a myriad of colours (lavender, orchid, plum etc), while a man looks derpy and only knows \"red, blue, green, yellow...\" etc.\n\nThe joke (I guess) is that women know more about aesthetics, and men are bad at them. But my gut reaction is that the joke is in favor of men, because the implications are that \"Women care about vapid things and men just care about more important things, and that's why they haven't learned about pointless shades of colour.\" Alternatively \"Caring about aesthetics is feminine and therefore bad, so not caring about it is masculine and good.\"\n\n\\--\n\nAnother example is:\n\n**\"Girls' rooms:\"**  \nFollowed by a super organized, well-decorated, tidy room.\n\n**\"Boys' rooms:\"**  \nFollowed by a literal junkyard.\n\nLike you'd think that's a joke poking fun at men.

First of all, I don't really understand how you guys even take it. You live absolutely anxious and shitty lives, having to worry every minute that something bad might happen to you. You do things men do normally every day with so much anxiety, like what will you dress today not to be judged or objectified, and being close with a guy because you think he might harass you. And worrying with small interactions, like with a cashier at a supermarket, because he can make a cringe comment or make you uncomfortable. Worrying about walking alone at night, worrying about being alone with a man because of fear of sexual assault, because you don't know his intent while also worrying about not wanting him to feel bad because he's making you afraid in case he's nice. Being afraid to say \"no\" to a guy, cuz he might attack you, insult you, call you a whore, and in some extreme cases kill you. And having to get to the deepest squat to tie your shoelaces (and I know women who do that) because you are afraid that some asshole creep might think this is an invitation to touch you if you bend over.\n\n\nAnd of course, the worst of all, pregnancy (one of the most painful experiences anyone could go through, and a big proportion of women go through, and sometimes multiple times, and sometimes even forced to it). And many other worst shit women go through daily. As an anxious guy, I'm always in awe at how women take all of this shit in their lives, experiencing assault and harassment, and having to hear guys say sexist stupid shit daily. Like, I sometimes really hold my punch at the \"women can't drive\" and the \"go back to the kitchen\" and the \"women dress this way because they want us to touch them and look at them.\" comments.  I really clench my fists, and I'm not even the oppressed group.\n\n\nI can't imagine how women hear this and not just give that person a little ol' kick in the nuts, really. And after all this shit, they come out of the other side stronger and better, and still are enthusiastic and passionate and hopeful that they will achieve success in their careers and in their lives. And actually do achieve it. It's actually very inspiring (I know I have been inspired by women at my depression times because I say, what type of shit am I going through compared to these people, and they still have hope and are that strong still). In fact, women should be the prime example of emotional strength (for women and men), not men.\n\n\nI know I and almost every other man I know in my life won't take all this shit and come out of it stronger or better. I already have friends who lost all hope, even though they don't go through half the shit women go through. So how after all this shit, how do people still have the nerve to say that women are \"ToO EmOtIoNaL\"?

I went to marches, I shouted slogans, and I posted hashtags. I listened to the experiences of the women I was trying to sleep with. I read Bell Hooks. I confronted my friends about how their misogyny reflected on me. I was a model ally, a champion of women everywhere.\n\nBut you didn't hold up to your end of the bargain. You've forgotten about someone important: men. You've let the separatists and the radfems take over. And I was willing to overlook that, I was willing to let it slide. Until late last month, that was all water under the proverbial bridge.\n\nThere's this feminist girl who lives on the same floor as me, and I see her every morning on the elevator: blonde, 5'8, skinny. My personal type. And I'm a thoughtful kind of guy, so one morning I notice she's not looking exactly the same: her cheeks aren't as full, her eyes not as radiant, there's less color in her lips. She looks tired, sad. Something is wrong. I make sure to inconspicuously stretch as I enter the elevator, revealing my \"KYLR\" shirt under my denim jacket, letting her know that I'm a safe person to talk to about whatever might be bothering her.\n\nShe doesn't seem to notice, so I ask her how she is. She doesn't respond, so I ask her again (but louder) and tap her shoulder. She looks up from her phone, pulls out one of her earbuds, and says \"Hmm?\" and I ask my question again. She says \"Oh, I'm fine! Thanks for asking.\" and puts her earbud back in. At this point, I knew I had to push harder. It wasn't going to be easy, but being an ally (I prefer the term \"accomplice\" personally) never is. So I put my hand on her shoulder and, when she takes her earbud out again, I tell her \"Hey, I'm here for you. You can tell me about your trauma, I'm a very safe person.\" I smile very widely while saying this to convey warmth. This is important, I think, because of our power differential. (she is 24 and I am 35)\n\nShe recoils as the elevator dings, saying \"Don't touch me, weirdo.\" As she walks out, she mutters \"ugh, men\" under her breath, which- I don't know about you guys- but that sounds pretty TERFy to me.\n\nAnyway, that's when the physical reactions began. That day I noticed my hair- previously long and voluminous- began falling out in chunks. I began having strange, gag like convulsions, with accompanying vocalizations, as though I were saying something involuntarily- the sound they made was \"Bu-gah-ee! Bu-gah-ee!\". That night the convulsions escalated into occasional vomiting, the product of which was a black, viscous substance.\n\nIt has been several weeks. I am now completely bald and I wear sunglasses no matter where I am. I regularly black out for several hours, and during these episodes I engage in strange and obscene behavior. According to the police, during one of my episodes I accosted several local teenage boys while they were riding their bikes, chasing them and screaming \"What color is your Bugatti?\" while pelting them with rocks. I am under investigation for stealing my grandmother's life support apparatus and selling it to pay for online slot machines. I am currently searching my local sex offender registry for someone to start a podcast with. I can hardly move around my apartment owing to the sheer number of cigars and cigar boxes which have accumulated.\n\nI can come to no other conclusion: my fateful encounter on that elevator has forced me to become a raging, pathological misogynist. You and feminists like you have done this to me. You have driven away a valuable ally, an absence whose hurt you will no doubt feel soon.\n\nSo given this story I have told, my question is this: How can feminism survive if it keeps driving away male allies like myself?","title":"How can Feminism survive if it keeps driving away male allies like myself?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/12qxy43\/how_can_feminism_survive_if_it_keeps_driving_away\/"}

Why are some people so fervent about it? Is it because people think the sex offender registry is just inhumane in general and they feel the need to stress that \"actually, sex offenders aren't always bad people\"? Or is it more related to how Reddit and society in general synpathizes with offenders more than victims?\n\nPersonally, I think we can reform the way we deal with sex offenders without also spreading myths about how everyone on the list was just a public urinator.

Thus, women have the responsibility to be assertive in these situation.\n\nThis mentality is exactly what\u2019s been troubling me, it seemingly doesn\u2019t even attempt to empathize with women or analyze one\u2019s own actions, and simultaneously lays the blame entirely on women as well.

We have movies like Taxi Driver, threads here on Reddit about it and also for example the Doomer meme which usually portrays a young man ([example video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DLbG8uQDexo)).\n\nHowever women experience loneliness too. By that I don't necessarily mean literal loneliness, so no relationship, friends etc but generally a belief that one doesn't have enough people around them, like you can have a SO but no friends and family, or friends but no family and SO and so on.\n\nAt a certain age, I would say maybe 25 it is normal to lose your friends, because they move someplace else, find a relationship and so on. At the same time people already have their friend groups so finding new friends can also be a hassle. Hell even when you're younger it can be difficult finding friends for multiple reasons. And finding a relationship can be a nightmare too. \n\nSo my question is then why do we rarely hear about loneliness from women? Could it be that on the internet there are generally more men than women so the former are more noticeable?

I don't have any debt, I own my own home and car, I have a good job, etc....\"\n\nThis got me thinking, because these guys seemed to be clueless to the idea that women can *also* have jobs now, all on our own. Like yeah, I (a single woman) would definitely want to date someone who had their financial life together....but this is like *baseline.* Women are going to want more than that in order to choose one guy out of everyone and say \"you sir, I want to see YOU with your clothes off.\" (Or: I want to spend my life with YOU and have your baby.) Etc.\n\nWe care about things like emotional intelligence. Are you supportive and kind? Are you 100% committed to doing 50% of the housework and emotional labor? If we have kids, is it automatically assumed that I take the career hit or are you gonna step up and volunteer to scale back on your dreams? Do we share interests? Do we make each other laugh? Is there *chemistry?* Are we wildly attracted to each other? Do you care about my orgasm? Et cetera and obviously these things will be different for everyone.\n\nMy sense of things is that there are some guys who have not caught up to the idea that women can have their own jobs and finances now. Like they really seem to be struggling with the idea that women are full adults with their own financial independence, and they think having their own job and house is all they need to attract a partner.\n\nAnd in a way it makes sense. Like before the 70s we couldn't have credit cards or bank accounts in our own name without a male co-signer, and a lot of jobs were not accessible to us. We were literally *shut out* of financial adulthood and resources if we weren't married. So in that time, yeah, many women probably had standards that revolved around those baseline things. The fact that men can no longer expect to attract a mate just by resource hoarding is a really new thing, culturally speaking.\n\nI think a lot of these guys are the ones who wind up voting for Trump, because he's trying to roll back women's rights and independence and promising to bring back a world where these men can \"make enough to provide for a wife and kids\" (I have heard Trump supporters in my own life describe it like this). And of course keep that wife under control because she has fewer options and no fault divorce is gone.\n\nIt seems pretty clear in how Trump supporters talk about women and relationships, as if they can't fathom women having jobs outside the home. For instance when reacting to that Julia Roberts ad about a woman voting secretly for Harris, [Charlie Kirk said](https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/campaign\/4964265-kamala-harris-ad-julia-roberts\/) \"I think it\u2019s so nauseating where this wife is wearing the American hat, she\u2019s coming in with her sweet husband who **probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go you know and have a nice life and provide to the family,** and then she lies to him saying, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019m gonna vote for Trump'\"...absolutely no consideration that women can also have jobs. There are loads of examples like this [(Harrison Butker](https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/kansas-city-chiefs-harrison-butker-e00f6ee45955c99ef1e809ec447239e0) comes to mind) (waves hand to indicate the entirety of the [tradwife phenomenon)](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/local\/salt-lake-city\/2024\/07\/25\/ballerina-farm-hannah-neeleman-times-profile-misogyny-tradwife-utah)\n\nI've seen essays about how Democrats should try appealing to these disaffected men who aren't making enough to support a family, but I'm not sure how they'd do that without sounding sexist. If the message is \"hey guys, if you want to make enough to provide for a wife and family, vote for me\" it sounds a bit sexist because *women* also want to make family-supporting money. It's not just exclusive to guys. We don't want to go back to a time when only men could have jobs.\n\nAnd Democrats already talk about improving the economy in gender neutral terms but that doesn't seem to be reaching these guys because what they care about is not just improving the economy for everyone, but restoring male primacy.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**Edited to add** because I think this is important, obviously this take of \"women never had jobs and men were the only ones who worked\" is oversimplified because women have worked outside the home throughout history. It's mainly about an idealized (based in nostalgia about white and middle class stereotypes) daydream these guys have about what it used to be like than reality. Although the part about women having a lot less financial recourse over all, and less freedom and ability to leave a bad relationship prior to the Civil Rights Act (in the US) is probably more accurate.","title":"Do you think some men are disaffected because they have cultural whiplash over women having jobs?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1gi6iiv\/do_you_think_some_men_are_disaffected_because\/"}

And women are given psychiatric medication for pain at a much higher rate than men.  \n\nAs a first responder it wasn't unusual for EMT's to assess women for mental conditions before treating them for pain.  It also wasn't unusual for EMT's to question whether women were exaggerating their pain because of course, women are more emotional and neurotic than men.  Men are strong, stoic and reliable when talking about their pain, so if a man says he's hurting, get him some pain meds stat because it must be serious.\n\nThe biggest myth I see in progressive men's groups like menslib and alt-right groups is that the medical community ignores men and caters to women.  This must be why women access medical help more often than men?  But the truth is, women are not rewarded for being proactive about their health.  They're stigmatized as being dramatic and emotional attention seekers.  Whereas men are brave and stoic and only access help when absolutely needed.  \n\nJust because the medical community targets women in ads doesn't mean women or girl's are treated well once they try to receive help.  Women are targeted for monetary gain because they know women are more likely to access help which means more money for hospitals and doctors.  The myth propagated by men's groups that the medical community just loves and cares about women more than men is laughable in the face of studies done in regards to the different treatment men and women receive. \n\nI'm interested in hearing feminist's thoughts on this subject.  How women are treated by medical professionals and why it's such a common myth that when women enter the medical system that they're needs are catered to, when studies show the exact opposite.","title":"Women\/Girl's pain treated less seriously than Men\/Boy's pain.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/kfrrib\/womengirls_pain_treated_less_seriously_than\/"}

WHY DO MEN DISMISS ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BLAME VICTIMS FOR \u201cTHE WAY THEY DRESS\u201d IF THEY END UP BECOMING DADS WANTING TO PROTECT THEIR DAUGHTERS FROM THE MEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEFENDING?!?!?\n\nI\u2019m just having a random flurry of uncomfortable thoughts in my head. \n\nSo it\u2019s super frustrating how so many men are playing defense when it comes to talking about rape charges or sexual harassment. They want to use the \u201cnot ALL men\u201d card and the \u201cbut what about women?\u201d excuse instead of trying to understand the problem being discussed at hand. \n\nI then realize how dads always end up being overprotective when they raise daughters. I hope our millennials and future gen z\u2019s try to raise their kids in a way where sons grow up respecting women and their bodies instead of just the \u201cboys will be boys\u201d mentality and the girls need to learn to be careful. \n\nIf dads KNOW what it is like to be a teenage\/adolescent male and don\u2019t want their daughters to deal with men who were like they were as young adults\u2014 WHY DID THEY NOT SUPPORT THE #METOO MOVEMENT in the first place?","title":"If dads are overprotective about their daughters, shouldn\u2019t men be more understanding of the MeToo movement?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/lt6h8u\/if_dads_are_overprotective_about_their_daughters\/"}

A lot of women feel like they're being lusted after and objectified by men, but not really liked as people, and that they look down on feminine coded interests, etc. And I'm honestly starting to think that in most cases in relationships If a guy met a man that had the same personality as their wife, they wouldn't want to be friends with that guy. But this is leading to my real question.\n\nDo women like men?\n\nDo women generally like men's personalities? Is this a one-sided thing that men are doing to you or is it that men and women generally don't like each other (due to socialization or whatever.)? Do women have a desire for male companionship that men are not reciprocating? Do you generally like men's personalities aside from the misogyny?\n\nI know obviously some men like some women as people and vice versa, but over all there is a disconnect here. I'm trying to get a feminist perspective because I feel like most other subs won't even acknowledge what my point is. I'd really like some input on this.

For 100 years, according to the data that included students from 30 countries, girls have been outperforming boys in all of their classes \u2014 reading, language and math and science. And they\u2019ve been doing it throughout their academic careers, from elementary school to high school. Which also means that the \u201cboy crisis\u201d \u2014 the worry that boys have recently been falling precipitously behind girls academically \u2014 is also a fallacy. They\u2019ve been getting lower grades than girls for a century.*\n\nEven when sexism and misogyny cut off the vast majority of careers and the workforce to women, and girls could really only dream of becoming maybe a nurse, secretary or teacher, they still outperformed boys who had access to higher education, the majority of careers and the workforce.  Just based on that you'd think girl's would believe education was a waste of time, leading to resentment and there would be a \"girl crisis\" where girl's would get lower grades than boys.\n\nSo girl's outperforming boys, even in math and science isn't something new.  Despite the myth we so often seen propagated in alt right and even progressive men's groups that this is a relatively new phenomenon plaguing boys due to the \"feminization\" of academia.  And when it comes to higher education women get more scholarships so it's cheaper, despite the fact that women are on the hook for almost 70% of the [1.5  trillion dollar student debt crisis](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/03\/13\/american-women-hold-two-thirds-of-all-student-debt-heres-why.html).

I see this among my peers especially, both online and off, where they want someone who is 'big and strong', 'takes charge', 'daddy', 'rich', 'tall', 'provider', protector' etc cetera. There's this particular thing about going on dates that really rubs me the wrong way, where the woman wants the man to basically tell them the date, time and attire, without asking for input. Like, what? Wouldn't you want to discuss the venue and figure out an appropriate time for both of you? The idea is that if he asks 'do you want to go on a date?', he lacks resolve and he's somehow 'not a man, but a boy'. \n\nI am attracted to men as well, but the type of man I'm attracted to is not what people would consider to be traditionally masculine. I've had instances where people have pulled me aside to quietly inform me that 'they think my boyfriend is gay' because he doesn't adhere to their ideals of what a straight man should be. These men weren't the type to get offended at the insinuation of being gay, but I did feel angry at the idea that they had to perform a certain type of masculinity to be considered straight. \nAnd at the end of the day, I can't control what people like or their preferences, but I can't help but feel like this is a shitty deal for men. Obviously we can't tell women what to be attracted to, but I don't know, it doesn't feel right to me that we tell men that hegemonic masculinity is harming them (which is absolutely true) while simultaneously being attracted to the presentation of hegemonic masculinity. \n\nWhile I recognise that most of the women pushing this type of rhetoric may not all be feminists, I feel like we need to be doing a better job of deconstructing and understanding desire\/attraction towards men, without hand waving it away because apparently women's desire\/attraction is a protected idea. It's not. Before I came out, I had a lot of regressive ideas of what a man should be (because I grew up in very conservative and regressive  country) and that coloured my ideas of what the ideal man should be, but taking the time to really break that down has honestly changed what I'm attracted to now. \n\nI want to add that I know that a huge chunk of this policing of men is carried out by other men but my focus in this post is about women who do the same.","title":"Why does so much of 'what makes a man attractive' still adhere to traditional masculinity?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1g12g16\/why_does_so_much_of_what_makes_a_man_attractive\/"}

For quite a few reasons.  One being, if that were true to the degree men complain about, I don't think we'd have an epidemic of rape and child sexual abuse where males are the vast majority of perpetrators.  Where 70% of male predators have up to 9 victims.  And it's not uncommon to have over a hundred victims.  We also wouldn't see a clear pattern of men who have serial raped women and children having a history of being  protected from suspicion, scrutiny and blame by those close to them and even those in their communities.  Women and men protect these perps.\n\nBut what really makes me angry is I constantly see men attack women that have been betrayed by men they trusted or harmed by random male strangers.  Like women walking alone, a man rapes, beats and or murders a woman and you have men attacking the victim like ,' what was she thinking?  What did she expect?\". Gosh, it's almost like they're saying she should have known she would have been preyed upon by predatory men.  So women are stupid and complicit in their victimization if they don't assume men are predators but then we're also sexist bitches if we do assume that's the case.\n\nAnother issue, men are seen as predators around children.  Yeah, not buying that again to the extreme men claim.  Time and time again we see women entrusted men with their children only to be betrayed by the man abusing and or murdering their children.  And again, men are at the forefront attacking mother's who were betrayed by men they trusted.  Sure, there are cases where mother's were co-abusers with the father's or other men that abused the child\/ren.  But this is not always the case.  And even when it's not, men will attack the mother claiming she put her boyfriend\/husband and getting dicked before her child.  Or if it was a male friend or relative, it's, \"what did she think was going to happen when she put her child in the care of a man?\".  \n\nSo men complain about being seen as predators and complain when women don't see men as predators.  And those that complain, of course aren't asking men to change their behaviors.  Like stop attacking and abusing betrayed women.  Or hell, how about stop raping, molesting and murdering women and children?  Of course not.

In fact, even outside of marriage, when men form friendships or networks with wealthier men for financial benefits \u2014 to gain opportunities, get jobs, be invited to luxurious parties \u2014 it\u2019s seen as smart networking. But when women do the same, especially if it\u2019s in a romantic or social context, they\u2019re often vilified as manipulative or shallow.\n\nWhy this double standard? Why is it socially acceptable for men to seek financial gain through relationships (romantic or platonic), but women are scrutinized more harshly for the same?\n\nCurious to hear other perspectives on this.","title":"Why are male gold diggers don't get much hate as much as female ones ?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1ljeb4d\/why_are_male_gold_diggers_dont_get_much_hate_as\/"}

(Although it doesn't appear to hurt them enough to dismantle it, and I think \"if he wanted to, he would\" is a saying very instructive in that.) \n\nFeminism helps both men and women, yes, but I think some of the ideas feminists push (for example, patriarchy hurts men too) have been accepted by many men who will not accept the parts of feminism that benefit women. \n\nSometimes I worry because there are a lot of men who are happy enough to adopt ideas from feminism but still believe traditional patriarchal narratives (e.g. someone who believes men shouldn't be forced to be stoic because that hurts them, but also that women are just naturally less likely to be smart. So supremacy and self-centering). I kind of wonder if they won't just \"take their bag and run\" if you know what I mean. There's no obligation to believe that women should be liberated and that men are oppressed at the same time. I also worry that these men will try to claim credibility by saying they are feminists and specifically point to \"patriarchy hurts men too\". \n\nif you look at history masculinity has shifted before with minor stuff like crying's acceptability, but the constant is men oppressing women and extracting their labor no matter what. In fact it is often believed historically that men produce both better art and better science than women, I think the main thread is men being considered generally \"better\" than women rather than one specific thing like \"logic\" or \"stoicism\". Even in countries that have less of the \"toxic masculinity\" culture (like where men show affection to each other) there are still severe misogyny problems. \n\nWill feminist ideas in the end selectively be used for men's benefit and leave women behind is the question I\u2019m.

I was wondering as a feminist myself, how other feminists feel about this. \n\nSo to make a longer story short, the wife had a go bag. Just clothes, money, important documents, feminine care items. $1000 max, in her closet. \n\nHer husband found it whilst cleaning the house for some repairs to be done, and questioned her about why she needs a go back. At first she said it was just for maybe a natural disaster, or other stuff like that. But he pressed and pressed, and eventually she said that a mommy forum told her that she should always have a go bag in the situation that her husband\/partner becomes abusive. He wanted to divorce or separate over knowing this, claiming that she \"doesn't trust him\" \n\nNow my initial reaction is that she's not wrong. \n\nI understand trust in a relationship. But statistically speaking, women are more likely to be murdered by their own partner than anyone else. Domestic violence rates are high aswell, and that's only self reported. Hell if your partner works in law enforcement, it's upwards of a 40% chance that domestic violence is occuring. \nThere have been countless stories of people being in relationships for 5, 10, 20 years. But on that 5 year, one month mark.. they get hit. Or yelled at. Or they break a wall that's behind them. \n\n\"Nice men\" can turn out to be not so nice in an instant. And that's not to say all men will turn out that way, a vast majority won't. But some will, and it can always be who you don't expect. \n\nBut of course the comments, again, were divided, and delved into light gender wars as usual. \n\"Well if she can do that then men should be able to have mandatory paternity tests\"\n\"She obviously hates men and needs therapy if she can't trust you\"\n\nBlah blah. Those arguments I kinda just didn't listen to, though. \n\nHow do you feel about it? From a feminist perspective, does it show a lack of trust, or simply a smart decision to make based on current statistics? \nDo you have such plans in place yourself, if you have a partner, what are their thoughts? \n\nI'm just curious in general. I know people feel vastly different ways about something like this.\n\nEdit: I thank everyone for the replies! This truly is a more nuanced issue than I previously anticipated, but that can be a good thing. \n\nThat said, as I said in another comment, if I did anything similar, I'd have money in the bank as opposed to a go bag. A go bag is much more of an urgent thing than just setting aside money \"just in case\". \nIt's also dependent on people's individual boundaries.

It's one of these things that even feminists seem to agree with, that men have a harder time with showing weakness than women (\"patriarchy hurts men too\", \"toxic masculinity\"). But I kinda doubt this is true. \n\nThe reality is, at least how I perceive it: Everyone is socially punished for showing weakness. If a man cries at his job, people will think he's less capable because he can't regulate his emotions. But of course, if a woman cries at her job, people will think too she's less capable because she can't regulate her emotions. It's only that the social punishment against women (not taking women serious) is so ingrained in our culture that it isn't even seen as punishment. If a woman cries and people think \"She's too emotional for XY\", this is not seen as a social punishment, but it absolutely is. \n\nMost people who rise to power positions do so by being emotionally strong, whether they're men and women. Margaret Thatcher or Hillary Clinton did not become powerful by crying (Thatcher herself was known as the Iron Lady). But in some cases, there are exceptions made for people who were for a long time in high status\/famous positions - however, I think these exceptions are more valid for men than women. This means, these men are more allowed to show weakness than women. A man like Jordan Peterson cried a lot for relatively minor reasons, yet his right-wing friends didn't attack him. I doubt that if a right-wing woman had cried so often as Peterson, her friends would have showed the same reaction. So overall, if we count all instances together (normal positions and high status positions), men are LESS socially punished for showing weakness than women.\n\nWhat do you think about this?

It ranges from women dating broke and lazy men who treat them bad to women choosing well off men that spoil them and then everything in between as long as it's negative.  It seems like as long as they're not being picked, women just must be picking bad or subservient weak men.\n\nThese men, which I don't believe are a small minority, don't just resent women, they also resentment the men they date and automatically assume they're shitty men.  \n\nAnd let's be clear here, these men only resent and hate women they consider attractive.  Women they don't, who also go through rejection and loneliness, they don't even exist in their mind.  Because women they don't deem attractive are invisible, because they don't matter.  This is why you basically see men's groups, whether their alt right or menslib, you rarely see an acknowledgement that rejected and lonely women exist.  Because they really don't in their minds.\n\nThen of course these men turn to groups that are nothing but terrorist groups aimed at harming women.  Many turn violent and commit terrorist acts like mass murder, abuse, harassment, threats of rape and murder, etc.\n\nI know the catch-all for men's issues is men can't express their feelings.  The reality is, men have been incredibly proficient in creating massive communities of support to vent their feelings.  I don't think anyone is unsure of how these men feel because their dealing with their issues stoicly or suppressing them.  They're pretty much in your face and have caught societies attention.  And they rarely pass up a chance to express their feelings to women.   So, I'm not sure I can believe not expressing emotions or feelings is part of the problem.\n\nLonely and rejected women just don't go to the extremes men go to.  And women tend to internalize rejection, they tend to blame themselves and at times deal with self-hatred for being unwanted.  And they tend to keep to themselves.  Men on the other hand are the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  And they're making sure as many people as possible know how they feel.\n\nSo why do you think men and women react so differently to the same problem of being lonely and rejected?

Not because they lied. Because their bodies, from birth, carried a difference: a natural variation in sex development.\n\nAnd now, sports regulators want to bring those tests back.\n\n**A broken system from the start**\n\nSex testing in women\u2019s sports didn\u2019t begin with science. It began with suspicion and sexism.\n\nIn 1967, the IOC introduced mandatory sex verification after rumors circulated that men were competing in women\u2019s events. They introduced chromatin testing that searches for the Barr body, a marker of two X chromosomes, following the IAAF that introduced compulsory testing in 1966. Before that, in the 1960s, the IOC instituted a policy that required women to undergo a physical examination by (usually female) physicians to \u201everify\u201c their biological sex.\n\nThat\u2019s right: athletes were forced to submit to physical checks to prove they were \u201ereal women.\u201c\n\nThen they tested the chromosomes.\n\nBut the tests didn\u2019t catch any fraud. No recorded instances of the tests detecting a man posing as a woman were ever documented. Instead, they flagged participants, some of the best athletes in the world, as biologically \u201einvalid.\u201d\n\nWhat happened to those women?\n\nSome were quietly disqualified. Some were publicly shamed. Some were forced into early retirement. Others, like Spanish hurdler Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez-Pati\u00f1o, fought back. When she failed her test in 1985 (despite being a cisgender woman with a condition called Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome), she was stripped of her scholarship and banned from competing.\n\nShe later won her appeal - but only after years of trauma, isolation, and humiliation.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t alone. Between the 1970s and 1990s, numerous other athletes were affected by similar \u201emismatches.\u201c These were not cheaters, not liars, not imposters. They were women living as women but born with natural variations that didn\u2019t fit the template officials decided was real.\n\nAnd the more they tested, the more exceptions they found.\n\nIn 1967, the case of Ewa\u202fK\u0142obukowska, a Polish sprinter who had just helped set a world record, sent shockwaves through the athletic world when she was disqualified after failing a Barr body test. Her medals were stripped, her career ended, and only later did scientists conclude the test result had been a false positive.\n\nYears earlier, Dutch runner Foekje\u202fDillema had been banned from competition after refusing to undergo a sex test in 1950. She stayed silent for decades. It was only after her death that DNA analysis revealed she was intersex - meaning she had been punished not for cheating, but for being born different.\n\nAnd they were not isolated cases. Across continents and disciplines, athletes were disqualified or excluded for having conditions like Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, chromosomal mosaicism, or hormone levels deemed \u201etoo high\u201c; despite living their entire lives as women, competing as women, and often not even knowing there was anything \u201eunusual\u201c about their biology.\n\nIt became clear that the system was unworkable. The science could not draw a clean line. The more officials tried to enforce it, the more women were harmed. That\u2019s why the IOC stopped testing altogether in 2000. Not because new technology solved the problem, but because the problem was the testing itself. There were too many failures, too many anomalies, too many women treated like frauds simply because their bodies didn\u2019t match someone\u2019s rulebook.\n\n**The system failed because the system was wrong.**\n\nNow they want to bring it back\n\nToday, amid moral panic about trans athletes, some are demanding a return to biological sex \u201everification\u201c, via chromosomes, genes, or even DNA.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly the kind of testing the IOC abandoned, because it couldn\u2019t distinguish between a trans woman, a cis woman, or an intersex person; each of them competing in the women\u2018s category.\n\n**Modern tests, same problem**\n\nSome argue that modern testing is more \u201eaccurate\u201c, that we now have the tools to double-check chromosomes, hormones, and DNA with better precision. But accuracy is not the issue. These tests were never about catching fraud. They were about defining womanhood by lab standards, and even the most precise test still turns biological diversity into disqualification. Technology can\u2019t fix a flawed premise.\n\nThe science hasn\u2019t changed. If anything, it\u2019s even clearer now:\n\n* Sex is not binary.\n* XY chromosomes don\u2019t equal \u201emale\u201c performance.\n* Many cis women have XY chromosomes, ambiguous genitals, or hormone profiles outside the \u201efemale\u201c range. And always have.\n\n**The cost: real women, discarded**\n\nThese tests do not protect women\u2019s sports. They harm it.\n\nThey turn women of all kinds into collateral damage. They tell young girls: if your body doesn\u2019t match a lab result, your achievements don\u2019t count. They treat trans women and intersex women as threats, not competitors.\n\nAnd worst of all: they pretend this is about fairness.\n\nBut fairness isn\u2019t singling out women whose biology challenges old norms. Fairness is creating space for all women to compete, without fear of being \u201etested out\u201c of their own identities.\n\n**Performance isn\u2019t defined by chromosomes**\n\nArguments that these women performed well because they were \u201ereally men\u201c collapse under scientific evidence.\n\nTraining, not chromosomes, wins medals: Elite athletes succeed due to a wide range of genetic and environmental factors. As of 2009, researchers had identified over 200 gene variants related to physical performance, with around 20 directly associated with elite status. A 2022 meta-analysis reinforced that there is no single \u201eperformance gene\u201c; traits like VO\u2082 max, pain tolerance, limb proportions, and aerobic threshold all play a role.\n\nIntersex \u2260 advantage: Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) occurs in XY individuals whose cells are unresponsive to testosterone. Despite male-range hormone levels, these individuals develop female bodies, with reduced or absent male-typical muscle or bone development. Studies show CAIS athletes may have less strength and muscle mass than average XX women, not more.\n\nNo single trait makes someone \u201etoo male\u201c: Sports medicine experts have long argued that testosterone is only one part of a complex athletic profile. Lung capacity, fast-twitch muscle fiber ratio, height, bone structure, and even psychological resilience all contribute to elite performance. A 2022 UK policy review emphasized that DSD athletes may have advantages. But no more than naturally tall basketball players or swimmers with unusually long wingspans.\n\nAs Professor D.J. Oberlin noted in *The Advocate*, athletic advantage is common and accepted - as long as you\u2019re cisgender.\n\n\u201eThere is no concern for restricting individuals who are exceptionally large or small, those who are genetically gifted, or those with differing hormone concentrations or muscle mass, so long as their gender and biologic sex align.\u201d In other words: exceptional biology is celebrated when it fits cis norms - and punished when it doesn\u2019t.\n\nOberlin also highlights the flawed reasoning in bans like those from World Rugby, which cited injury risk as a justification. \u201eIf injuries are a primary concern, rugby should have weight classes\u201c, he writes - not blanket bans on trans women.\n\nHe adds that fears of cis men pretending to be trans are unfounded: \u201eThere are no legitimate cases of this occurring.\u201c And beyond being baseless, these exclusions \u201einsult the skill and athleticism of both cis and trans athletes.\u201d\n\n(Source: The Advocate, \u201eWhat Does the Science Say About Transgender Women in Sports?\u201d by Trudy Ring)\n\n**We already learned this lesson. Don\u2019t make us repeat it.**\n\nThis isn't hypothetical. This already happened. And the sports world already decided it was wrong.\n\nIn 1999, the IOC's own medical commission concluded that:\n\n    \u201eThere is no single definitive marker that can be relied upon to determine sex.\u201c\n    (IOC Medical Commission Report, 1999)\n\nWe don\u2019t need to bring back outdated tests.

And not showing vulnerability one of many stoic traits. We say poor men can't express vulnerability all the while we're constantly being bombarded by male vulnerability.  Showing vulnerability isn't just crying and saying my feelings are hurt. Vulnerability is expressing the irrational and hysterical fear of false rape accusations. Vulnerability is expressing being victimized by women on dating apps and the 80\/20 OkCupid myth.  \n\nVulnerability is expressing hysteria over the metoo movement and threatening women with discrimination in the workplace   We won't hire, mentor, shake hands, have business lunches, be in a room alone until you go back to being silent about sexual harassment and rape.  Or even worse, we're so hysterical with fear of being victimized by women,  if you're dying of a heart attack, I'm not going to try to save your life because CPR will get me hauled off to prison for 20 years and my life ruined forever.\n\nJust because men express emotions, feelings and vulnerability which are gendered so-called \"feminine\", in such toxic ways, doesn't mean they aren't actually expressing those things.  And that's what male supremacy has programmed society to believe. Feminine traits in men is a threat to male supremacy and patriarchy, at the same time, silenced men is also a threat to the status quo.  So the status quo allows men to express all their feelings, vulnerabilities and emotions all the while programming society not to see the reality of what they're doing.\n\nSo my question to feminists is, what, if any so-called masculine trait that is commonly associated in men do you find to actually be a trait not commonly seen in men?","title":"What so-called \"masculine trait\" that is commonly associated with men do you find is actually not common in men?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/w7xf1x\/what_socalled_masculine_trait_that_is_commonly\/"}

In Vietnam, Sweden, France, India.  They experience life as women from day 1.

They're often raised and socialized as men, even if that's not their gender identity.\n\nI understand why people oppose a feminism that excludes trans women.

I agree with America Ferrera because women are not allowed to enjoy the things that they love and what makes them happy, and we always must cater and satisfy other people\u2019s needs and desires, especially men.

It's also shone too much of a spotlight on some pretty vile groups of extremists, like the alt-right, tankies, TERFs, MRAs, anti-vaxxers, and conspiracy theorists of all stripes, who always existed but before were at least filed away in their own little spots, while now they get into the mainstream and interact with everyone else. But I've always been very progressive and just ignored the above...unfortunately two recent incidents kind of convinced me that even the \"woke\" side I at least considered well intentioned is also pretty toxic: that of Lindsay Ellis and Sarah Paulson.\n\nFor those unfamiliar Lindsay Ellis made a tweet comparing Raya and the Last Dragon to Avatar: The Last Airbender and how it's influenced so much animation media since then...apparently as Raya was written by Southeast Asian writers and based on Southeast Asian mythology this led to a backlash against her, which also blew up while she was sleeping and she awoke to get hundreds of hate messages, people accusing her of being responsible for anti-Asian hate crimes and death threats and all that. She deactivated her Twitter account and then later uploaded an hour and 40 minute video addressing the situation and the toxicity of Twitter in general, I haven't watched the whole thing (although I probably will at some point, since I am a fan of hers), but from what I've seen she didn't exactly apologize but instead highlighted other potentially problematic things that she did, not so much to apologize but rather to ask if \"the punishment fit the crime\" so to speak and if such things are deserving of Internet mob vigilante justice, which I tend to agree with. After all she's a very progressive feminist who's gotten shit from alt-right trolls in the past for that reason, and argued for progressive values in many of her videos. She also noted correctly that people like her who are perceived as being on that side are treated far worse if they deviate from orthodoxy in some way than the likes of say, Ben Shapiro, as people like that feed on the hate from that corner, and thus try to provoke it.\n\nAs for Sarah Paulson her case was pretty simple: She's a lesbian actress who has long been a vocal support of the trans community as well. Someone made a tweet demanding (I saw the original tweet and despite what some later reports said it wasn't \"asking\" or \"requesting\") that she put her pronouns in her bio. She replied back with a tweet basically saying that she's not going to let someone else tell her what to do. Well then came the backlash and vigilante mob. She was called a TERF (obviously not true from her history and previous statements on the trans community), and even subjected to harassment straight out of Gamergate, a bunch of people called her ugly, attacked her wife and the age difference between them (as her wife is about 30 years older), and made some pretty objectifying comments about her to boot (like \"We just lost another MILF\") and also told her they hoped she died or that she should kill herself. Even the original poster who made the demand later posted that she regretted what became and deleted her original tweet, but at that point it was too late as the mob was in full force. Most comments about it were supportive of her, but it still exposed a very ugly element which ironically was supposedly in the name of inclusivity.\n\nAnd then there was the Animal Crossing \"space buns\" incident which I won't go into detail of because frankly it's so stupid and absurd it makes me disappointed in humanity to recap it, although you can find a bunch about it just by searching those things. That didn't involve a public figure though so I assumed it was probably largely internal community drama. But these last two...sheesh. It's not like we were even talking about Justine Sacco who at least said something quite insensitive and that could be perceived as racist, Lindsay Ellis simply made a standard comparison of one media work to another and Sarah Paulson just declined to do something that most people on Twitter don't and I think is generally agreed upon by the vast majority of trans activists should ultimately be someone's choice and not something they're forced into.\n\nSo...thoughts? This stuff really upsets me and unfortunately it's hard to bring up the issues with without sounding like a right-winger, since they tend to be the only ones who cover it heavily and act like sharks smelling blood when something occurs along those line. But it greatly harmed two underserving public figures and many more not as high profile but still underserving people (like the girl in the Animal Crossing case.)","title":"Does anyone agree that \"woke Twitter\" has gotten extremely toxic?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/na7s8m\/does_anyone_agree_that_woke_twitter_has_gotten\/"}

Or is there another reason why this phrase, in particular, is seen as problematic?\n\nFor example, when discussing societal issues tied to a dominant religious group, saying *\"Not all \\[members of that religion\\]\"* is generally seen as a valid clarification rather than derailing.

Virginity itself is neither good nor bad, I think.\n\nWith that said, why do so many people feel that they can freely mock virgins? And also freely mock \"losers\" who don't measure up to societal expectations (high-paying job, lots of friends, a wife\/girlfriend, a car, etc.).\n\nIs this attitude patriarchal in nature? Does feminism condone the mockery of men who don't have sex or can't find relationships?\n\nIt's not just the right-wingers and conservatives who practice this virgin-shaming or loser-shaming, but even people on the left. Even people who passionately argue for equality can still fall for the trap of dismissing others as \"just\" virgins and friendless losers. It kinda ticks me off every time I see a well-worded feminist argument followed up by a sneering, scornful comment about their opponents' supposed lack of sex.\n\nIsn't that kind of immoral though? It's not like ALL virgins are sexist, angry incels. And even if they were, targeting their virginity is so under-handed, and only justifies their resentment toward a society that looks down on virgins. I don't agree with incels, but isn't it obvious that part of their issues stem from society's obsession with sex, money, power, and marriage?\n\nAnd sometimes the virgin insult is used on people who aren't even virgins, implying that just being a virgin is seen as some kind of sin or abomination.\n\nDoes feminism have a stance on this?

By the end of the day, the bra would be sticky with sweat, and who wants to wash their bra every single day? I\u2019m traveling and in a super hot country, and unfortunately only packed one bra. Seeing men go around in tank tops and no bras made me seriously question why I felt like I \u201chad\u201d to wear a bra. More and more, I wore it less. Physically, I felt better. Less constriction, less sweat, less laundry. \n\nHowever, I didn\u2019t have anything to cover my nipples. I soon noticed people staring relentlessly and not looking away even when I stared back. We\u2019re talking 10+ seconds of staring. \n\nI find myself wondering, how is it more of a social faux pas to not wear a bra than to literally stare down someone\u2019s breasts? With many of these people being women staring directly at my chest, I couldn\u2019t help but feel as though they were staring out of judgement and disgust. Whatever the reason, shouldn\u2019t there be no excuse?\n\nI understand everyone has the \u201cchoice\u201d to wear or not wear a bra. But it *really* doesn\u2019t feel like a choice. When I look at my nipples and natural breast shape and feel disgusted, I know it\u2019s not because I actually don\u2019t like how it looks, but because society hasn\u2019t normalized going braless. However, I will often forget that I\u2019m not wearing a bra, until I catch someone staring, look down, and realize exactly what they are staring at. \n\nEven more so, with every stare, I feel the need to put down my hair, cross my arms, or hold something in front of my chest to cover up my breasts. \n\nIf I see a mans bulge in public, I will quickly look away, knowing it\u2019s inappropriate to stare. I do not feel like it\u2019s a man\u2019s responsibility to cover up his bulge in public, unless he\u2019s aroused. Even so, nipples are not quite the same. There are plenty of men with breasts, and I can clearly see their nipples through their shirt, but I do not wish to stare or shame them for it. \n\nMy question is, are nipples inherently inappropriate? If going braless, should we at least wear something to cover up the nipples? In more conservative countries (I\u2019m currently in south east asia, and there is a law that dictates people must wear underwear, bras included, but it is not enforced) should we abide by the societal rules? In formal situations or work, is the nipple something that should be covered up? For example, when meeting with a male professor one on one or meeting my partners family, I can\u2019t help but feel as though I should be sure no one can see my nipples through my shirt. The obvious answer is, \u201cno, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s choice,\u201d but, the more I go out, society really doesn\u2019t make it seem like a choice. To anyone who has experience with this, are there any occasions when you choose to hide your nipples and how do you react to unsolicited stares?","title":"When going braless doesn\u2019t feel like a choice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/ogty85\/when_going_braless_doesnt_feel_like_a_choice\/"}

We should know certain conditions cause excess facial hair.

Why is queerness used as a slur to reject softness or hygiene?\n\nThese guys aren\u2019t evil. They\u2019re called \u201cgood guys\u201d because they\u2019re not violent or aggressive.

In other words, a woman shouldn\u2019t be sleeping with a man just to sleep with man, she should be getting more than that out of it (dates, gifts, financial benefits, someone to rely on outside of sexual contexts, etc, are among those I\u2019ve seen mentioned).

But the last few years of popular culture and topics trending on social media have amplified my feminism (as one would expect). I (23\/F) am about to graduate from university and have learned a lot about myself, peers, adults, society, etc. over the years. I find it hard to feel optimistic about strides that women make in society and around the world and, rather, dwell on the fact that it\u2019s 2021 and there is still so much to be done (I\u2019m a pessimist by default [I\u2019m working on it lol]). A lot of what I\u2019ve been ruminating on lately is how women are treated by men in the dating world; especially on dating apps. It\u2019s extremely disheartening to be thought of as a commodity or a dime a dozen. And, because of this, the more guys I date, the lower my self esteem becomes. Dating as a straight woman in 2021 is not fun. \n\nThat being said, I have been in the dating pool for a few years now. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m an active dater. I probably date a new guy every few months. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship. The longest I\u2019ve dated a guy is 3 months. I am guilty of convincing myself to look past red flags in order to prolong the period in which I am receiving affection and attention from a guy even if I know I\u2019m better off in the long run if I bail. I have dated genuinely nice guys. And I have dated assholes. The overwhelming majority of the guys that I have dated (nice or asshole-ish) are not looking for anything further than casual dating and\/or hookups (I know my age and being a college student makes things worse in this regard). I am tired of feeling like I\u2019m being taken advantage of just because I expect more from dating a guy than he does. I know I am an adult that can make their own decisions. But at this point it doesn\u2019t seem like there are many decisions to be made. Either I date men that pursue me with no intention other than a brief fling or I throw my phone in a dumpster and disappear off into the woods to join my fellow clan of witches vs. the patriarchy. \n\nMy third option is to date men that are unattractive to me in some respects (education, maturity, physical appearance, etc) and hope for the best. This sounds worse to me though. So maybe we\u2019ll just table that option for now. \n\nI would like to say that I know I am generally attractive in regards to societal standards. I feel as though this also plays into the poor experience I have had with dating. Men imagine me as more of an opportunity to boost their egos than they do as an actual person with thoughts and feelings. I don\u2019t want to have to date down just to find someone who wants a relationship with me. \n\nI have several friends that are in long term relationships with men that are clearly not in the same league as them. They seem happy enough, but it\u2019s obvious there are some things in their relationships that would be deal breakers for me. \n\nIdeally, I want to be in a position where I\u2019m happy with myself and my life and any sort of romantic aspect would just be an additional bonus (I\u2019m working on this in therapy; I promise). I tell myself after every fling that I\u2019m taking a break from dating to focus on myself. And after a few months, I get bored, lonely, affection deprived, etc. that I\u2019m back on that dating grind and starting the whole process over again. \n\nI don\u2019t want to hear \u201cthe right one is out there,\u201d \u201cforget men,\u201d \u201chappiness lies within,\u201d etc. It\u2019s not wrong of me to want a partner. It\u2019s not wrong of me to seek affection. It\u2019s not wrong of me to seek support or encouragement from a romantic partner. And, yes, I know dating apps are toxic. But I have yet to hear of an alternative during this day and age. \n\nAlso, to be clear, I make my intentions apparent up front and still end up in the same position.\n\nDo any of you or have any of you had similar mindsets? What have you learned and\/or done to become more optimistic? Have you discovered things that make dating men in a patriarchy actually fun? Have any of you had fun dating in the Age of the Dating App? Have any of you had success dating?

The main post of the thread justified men being frightened of false rape accusations because of the social and legal consequence of the accused. Although false rape accusations are actually rare, and are normally revealed to be \"false\" by investigators, I understand the fear many men have about being falsely accused. There ARE times where falsely accused people end up in prison, only to be let go years after they were \"found\" to have not raped anyone. There are areas that quickly take the side of the accuser without even waiting for the court's word on the situation.\n\nHowever, empathy turned to disgust when I got to the comment section. Many comments used the fear of men being scared about being falsely accused to simply, well, bash women as some \"evil monolith that are hellbent on destroying men's lives\". An awarded, and well-upvoted comment was even referring to women as the c-slur as they belittled what feminists often stood for, and phrased them as if they were a bunch of lying monsters..\n\nMy question is....what in the ***actual fuck*** is wrong with so many of these dudes? Yes, bad things happen to men that do need to be addressed, but somehow the existence of men's issues makes any struggle a woman faces \"a lie\"?? \n\nLet me air out some research I've been doing for an upcoming Google Doc:\n\nInfo: Pappas, Stephanie. 2015. \u2018Why Breadwinner Spouses Are More Likely to Get Cheated On\u2019.

In fact, the idea for the study came about when she was talking with a male friend of hers who had cheated on his financially successful wife\u2019, Munsch told Live Science\u201d. \u2018He felt like his partner had all the friends, [all the money, all the success](https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/7415-people-handle-success.html), because this person wasn't working, and his wife was,\u2019 Munsch said\u201d.\n\n Info: Voges, Mona M.

It has been suggested that the pressure to conform to the body ideal and to look good is higher in women than in men because women are more frequently confronted with ideal bodies in the media and because in Western societies, beauty is more essential to the feminine than to the masculine gender role ([Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997](https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2019.00544\/full#B21); [Knauss et al., 2007](https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2019.00544\/full#B34); [Buote et al., 2011](https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2019.00544\/full#B8)). Accordingly, body size seems to be a more relevant factor for the self-worth of women than for the self-worth of men ([Owens et al., 2010](https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2019.00544\/full#B48)). Moreover, the standards for the female body ideal depicted in society seem to be clearer, while the male body ideal comprises more divergent body types, represented by more heterogeneous, also average-weight, media images of men ([Buote et al., 2011](https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2019.00544\/full#B8))\u201d. \n\nInfo: CBS News, Journalist Staff.

During most tragedies, it was every man for themselves, and it was often men and not women (and children) which survived in greater numbers. Titanic being the exception due to behaviour of the officers\u201d.\n\nInfo: Salari S. (2007).

[Figure 1](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2685270\/figure\/f1-cia-2-441\/) illustrates that the vast majority of violence perpetrators (96%) were men...Most victims did not consent to the act and when the danger was known to the victim, some fought back or attempted to flee. However, there was evidence that most were surprise attacked and seemed unaware of their fate. Reports noted victims were engaged in some other activity such as eating, sleeping or resting...Victims were more often women who were primarily homemakers. Many were active in voluntary organizations and for those who had jobs\/careers, their occupations included, medical doctor, nurse, dentist, teacher, store manager, cook, grocery worker, restaurant owner, guidance counselor, waitress and maid. Clearly, there was a great variety in the life work of the people who were affected by this lethal domestic violence\u201d. \n\nInfo: Huecker MR, King KC, Jordan GA, et al.

Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 10 men 18 years of age or older experience domestic violence. Annually, domestic violence is responsible for over 1500 deaths in the United States.[\\[11\\]\\[12\\]\\[13\\]](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK499891\/#)\u201d.\n\n\u201cDomestic violence victims typically experience severe physical injuries requiring care at a hospital or clinic. The cost to individuals and society is significant. The national annual cost of medical and mental health care services related to acute domestic violence is estimated at over $8 billion. If the injury results in a long-term or chronic condition, the cost is considerably higher.\n\nInfo: Asscher, J. J., Van der Put, C. E., & Stams, G. J. (2015).

Additionally, the mean number of each different form of maltreatment was compared by means of a t- test, with the mean number of maltreatment incidents as dependent variable, and gender as a grouping variable. The mean number of maltreatment incidents was significantly higher in female than in male juvenile offenders\".\n\nOh, but apparently all this shit is overblown? Exaggerated? Just \"*made up\"*? (\/s)\n\nThen they'll use the \"but women are privileged\" argument when confronted about facts of what many women face out there. And yes, women are privileged in some aspects such as lighter sentences when it comes to doing crime, but does that shit really make up for the fact that many women and girls have phases of their life, and parts of their minds **fucking wrecked** by abuse? Like, there's many good things going for men as well, like not being the overwhelming majority of human trafficking victims, not drastically losing income for being a single parent, and being their gender being the majority of those in the political office, as well as the police force. But wouldn't it be fucked up to use advantages men often get in life to belittle the struggles they do have? So why do people think hoards of men lining up for a woman on a dating app (usually just for a pump and dump under the guise of the men actually being interested in who she is as a person) is a \"privilege\" and somehow makes up for the fucked up things that happen to so many women and girls out there?\n\nThen many dudes will go like, \"But if you're a girl, people are always gonna listen to your word on things. Nobody listens to men when they suffer\"...as if it's popular for people to take a woman's word if something bad happens in her life?\n\nInfo: Kiesel, Laura.

Sexual aggression is also particularly likely among the newest members of an all-male group: Fraternity pledges are the most likely of all college males to commit a sexual assault on campus (see [Bohmer and Parrot, 1993](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6348335\/#B21)). Individual level factors such as threats to power or status may be particularly problematic within all-male groups, increasing the likelihood of sexual assault, rape myth endorsement, and victim blaming\u201d.  \n\nIt\u2019s even arguable that the legal system is on board with failing rape victims, and thus failing many women in the process. \n\nInfo: Gordon, Emily. (2019, May 17). \u2018Untested Rape Kits: Delays, Destruction, and Disregarded Victims\u2019. American Bar Association.

Like, the topic of men's issues can easily be addressed without invading any discussion\/conversation that's supposed to be about women. It's like it just doesn't *click* that they can talk about what they've been through, as men, without even mentioning women in the mix. They can have discussions that focus entirely on themselves, but it's like so many of them just don't. It's like they just HAVE to go after women under the same breath, and it makes me wonder as to just why the fuck so many people bash\/dehumanize women as a whole like it's a **first-fucking-*****instinct..***\n\nLike, why? Both men and women can easily group together to help stop issues that are popular for both respective genders, but instead so many people make it out to be a fucking war competition.","title":"Why are people so quick to use men's issues as a reason to be sociopathic towards women's struggles?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/oydp6m\/why_are_people_so_quick_to_use_mens_issues_as_a\/"}

Non-invasive vasectomies are...NON-INVASIVE. They\u2019re an outpatient procedure and after reading a lot about it, they\u2019re compared to dental procedures that you can drive home from, and the worst part is the pain of anaesthetics. The only issue seems to be that vasectomies are harder (and completely possible) to reverse, and that insurance doesn\u2019t cover reversal (but they do cover vasectomies).\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss IUDs. In a lot of countries, people who haven\u2019t given birth are\u2019t considered for IUD procedures and some countries administer local anaesthesia. Im not mentioning it because I agree, but because of the implications of severity. Most women are given ibuprofen, which doesn\u2019t do much considering you have to push past the cervix opening (that is closed tight) with a rod to insert an IUD. For those who are having a hard time imagining, think about a hard rod being shoved up your urethra. \n\nAs for side effects, where do I even begin? Constant bleeding for 1-6 months after the insertion? Weight gain? Acne? Fever and debilitating cramps after insertion? Severe PMS mood swings that border on clinical depression? Life threatening (ectopic) pregnancy? Irregular\/heavy bleeding until it\u2019s taken out? Increase risked of infections? Perforation (piercing through the uterus wall)? Extreme cramping with a copper (non-hormonal) IUD?\n\nI am sick and tired, and frankly, disgusted, by the pressures put on women to be the ones responsible for birth control when it takes two to reproduce. And for the people who think: not my body, not my problem, you think paying for an abortion or child support is a risk not worth taking? Birth control comes with awful side effects, and do you know how stressful it is to take a pill at the same time everyday? Do you know what it\u2019s like to make plans always having to consider that? Compared to a one-time non-invasive, outpatient procedure that has the highest rates of preventing pregnancy?\n\nI see high school and college students taking responsibility and getting IUD insertions. It\u2019s about time we start calling out absurd double standards and placing responsibility on all participating parties.\n\nDear women, don\u2019t feel discouraged. I\u2019m iffy about talking to my male friends about this but what seems to separate the boys from the men is that while boys remain self-centred and self-involved, men understand my stance and even begin to agree with it.\n\nI want to reiterate, I\u2019m not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves. I\u2019m here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them.\n\n#ittakestwo\n\n[Edit: I don\u2019t know if vasectomies are a viable solution. BUT...I would like to point out the discrepancy in the way we discuss what men might have to endure and what women have repeatedly endured. If there\u2019s such a huge burden on women, isn\u2019t it worth it to discuss and explore a variety of solutions no matter how bizarre they might seem before shutting it down completely? Are womens\u2019 burdens THAT insignificant that we immediately shut down something that seems scary but may or may not be scary in actuality? THAT insignificant that we shut down solutions because the IDEA of it causes discomfort? THAT insignificant that possible pain takes priority of actual pain?]\n\n[Edit 2: I thought my intentions were clear but I guess not. This isn\u2019t about IUDs versus vasectomies. I could have made vague statements about the double standards. Instead, I used tangible details so there\u2019s something concrete that people can grasp\u2014>so EVERYONE can actually get involved in the discussion instead of thinking it doesn\u2019t apply to them. I guess that\u2019s working to some extent and I understand why people are getting stuck on the technicalities, but it\u2019s distracting from the main issue. I came across this quote: \n\u201cwe had to make choices that many of you will disagree with.

I'm sure this isn't a real world thing, however I know TikTok has a large number of users. So the chance of this stuff trickling into actual vocabulary and thought process isn't zero. After all, social media ultimately does influence what people think, especially if consumed regularly. \nI have my own perspective on this, but I wanted to ask other feminists. \n\nGirl Dinner, usually refers to when some women eat very little for dinners, or they only eat just snacks. It's gotten heavy fire from people claiming that it's making eating disorders \"cute\", because the joke is that they're not eating enough. \n\nGirl math, is usually something along the lines of \"if I took something back and bought something with that money, that was free.\" This usually refers to shopping more often than not. It was an entire trend to explain it to men and have men be flabbergasted because of course, it doesn't make sense. Or it does, but the joke being \"it only makes sense to girls\"\n\nGirl hobbies is much newer, and is again a long the lines of \"girl hobbies: getting a cute little drink.\"\nThen I saw a girl who was calling this entire thing ridiculous, self infantilizing, and stupid. Claims that we're setting ourselves backwards because usually women\/girls are the ones to come up with these phrases. \n\nI feel like it has the potential to be nuanced. On one hand, is it really bad to embrace more \"feminine\" things that a lot of women seem to enjoy doing? After all it originated on the Internet, and being 19, I know this kinda thing isn't trickling to Millennials. It's mostly contained to Gen Z and Alpha. It could just be teaching them to embrace their little quirks, or finding togetherness in \"feminine\" things, even though none of it should be gendered anyway in my opinion. \n\nBut on the other hand, what could it teach younger people who do consume this content? Could it lead to them \"dumbing\" themselves down, because at the core of all of these trends is, \"well I'm just a girl, of course this is what I do\"?\n\nI feel like because of this, it's a slippery slope. On one hand it could bring people together, but on one hand it could definitely be seen as \"setting back feminism\" or \"infantilizing\".\nBecause of all this, I just want to hear other people's opinions on this. Ultimately I know it's probably just an Internet thing, but I was curious either way.

So, if Bernie Sanders had won the presidency in 2016, would progressivism have been more popular than right-wing politics, especially amongst younger and older men, today? Instead of there being \"redpill\" content being heavily pushed towards young men, would there have been \"bluepill\" content being pushed instead? How different would the political climate be today?\n\nI bring up Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton because she's quite unpopular amongst voters due to her close ties to the establishment & elites, and she wouldn't have had the same effect as Bernie - who is loved by young men. Bernie's call for a political revolution - taking back our country from the billionaire class, corporate greed, big-money interests, and steering the Overton window toward progressivism - and a fundamental change of the status quo is the type of rhetoric loved by young guys who feel lost and disillusioned in today's world; unfortunately in our timeline, they're taken advantage of by right-wing grifters and fall deep in the alt-right rabbit hole, which was what my friends and I went through before we became staunch progressives and Bernie & AOC supporters.","title":"If Bernie Sanders had won the presidency in 2016, do you think progressivism would've been more popular amongst young men today (especially Gen-Z) than right-wing politics?

I know that in order for liberation to occur, we must work with people of all races, genders, nationalities, etc, to make it happen.\n\nHowever, I find that I always seem to fall into a trap of anger and resentment.\n\nAnd this is because as a woman of color, I feel very unprotected and feel as though I am always trying to seek solidarity with others, but that effort is unreciprocated.  \n\nFor instance, I always try my best to support my male friends in times of sadness or pain. When my male friends are being made fun of for their appearance or their clothing, I always try to pipe up and defend them. And I am very careful to not make fun of men when they cry, in any circumstance. However, I am willing to say that most men do not care about women\u2019s rights, are casually sexist, constantly derail conversations about women\u2019s rights, do not defend women from sexism, and many men will protect each other from accusations of r * pe or abuse. And this isn\u2019t even scratching the surface.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s talk about white women. When I saw how many white women voted for Trump, in 2016 and 2020, I was disappointed but not surprised. When I saw white women carrying disgusting signs about having sex with black men at BLM protests, I was disappointed but not surprised. When this white woman I know posted about George Floyd and solidarity with woc, but later told me she voted for Trump\/republicans, I was disappointed but not surprised. Again, not even scratching the surface.\n\nLike I said, I know that I need solidarity with men and with all women, including white. But with men acting the way they act and with white women\u2019s racism, I feel more and more demoralized. At times, out of anger, I have even said that I don\u2019t care about either group and they can go fuck themselves and fight on their own. I know that this is irrational. But this is so often how I feel and I can feel myself falling into this trap. \n\nI wish that I was like Dr. King or Dr. Cornel West- able to forgive those who hate me. But I really don\u2019t know if I can. I really really don\u2019t know. \n\nHow can I start to do this? How can I overcome my anger and frustration? I would appreciate any help, especially if you are a WoC or otherwise marginalized.\n\nEDIT: Hello everyone,\n\nWow. Thank you all SO much for your responses. I\u2019ve had a busy day and am just now making my way through them. Even if I haven\u2019t responded, I have read the comments and have found many of them to be helpful and validating.\n\nI very much feel seen. Although this issue is not resolved, and I anticipate that it won\u2019t be for a while, I have taken to heart much of the advice and kind words that you all have left me.

It's abuse, it's rape, it's not morally debatable even if the child would later say (which Dolores did not!) that she has not been coerced etc\n\nNow, a significant number of the men I talked to (3 out of 5 to be precise), all of whom I consider great people and all self-identified feminists, agreed overall, but started to do the whole 'yeah but' thing. Yeah but what did she feel, maybe she was alright with it, yeah but if she was slightly older, yeah but what if she was mature for her age etc.. In common they had that there seemed to be this assumption that, theoretically, a child could consent if the stars aligned or whatever. Now, I don't know how many 12 year olds people have been around, but honestly, am I just completely wrong here when I say that HARD NO, a 12 year old, even if they themselves at the time believe that it was consensual (something that I personally have never even heard of, and seems to be a rather absurd hypothetical situation in lights of the thousands and thousands of child abuse cases), CAN NOT give informed consent to sex with an adult, never mind to a relationship?\n\nThere has even been an instance where I wasn't even sure what we were talking about anymore or what exactly he was saying, just that there was a need for a 'but' there that just wouldn't go away.\n\nI'm not sure if I just am very very biased, coming from a position of a woman who has been sexually harassed by a much, much older man that I trusted when I was 14, and from the position of a therapist who sees so many women who have gone through sexual abuse by an adult when they were kids. Maybe I'm not seeing the 'but' here. \n\nSo yeah, I guess what I'm asking for is: have you made similar experiences with men on this topic and if yes, why do you think that is? Also, if you think I'm too undifferentiated and need to consider a different angle that I'm just not seeing, feel free to point it out.\n\nEDIT: minor typos.","title":"'Yeah but actually...' from Men when talking about sexual abuse of children (Trigger Warning!!!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/kn65hp\/yeah_but_actually_from_men_when_talking_about\/"}

Someone said how we need to stop \"women and children\"-ing because these men are sacrificing so much and deserve to live as much as women and children do. \n\nIt made me think, because I as a man have been guilty of using the \"women and children\" language in the past. But when I think about it, a report saying for instance \"500 people were killed, including women and children\" is quite messed up. Firstly, it dehumanises men - they're seen as more disposable, and their deaths are simply statistics, not tragedies. But it also infantilises women, for obvious reasons - women are seen as defenceless and powerless in times of war, but I think we can all agree that this is certainly not always the case, as is shown both throughout history and in our own times. And of course it perpetuates the idea that women are weak and must be protected by big, strong men.\n\nAll civilians are powerless in conflict, but there sometimes seems to be an automatic assumption that every man is a combatant, when this is obviously blatantly untrue. The language just rubs me the wrong way, and I'm going to try and stop using it. \n\nObviously it's not a massively important issue in the grand scheme of things, but I've just been thinking about it for a while. Should we try and stop using \"women and children\", and maybe instead simply use \"unarmed civilians\" or \"children and their guardians\" or something like that?

Looking back I'm assuming he was flirting. He got really animated and intense and stared me down. I laughed at him, because it was super weird and I felt really uncomfortable. He said it made him feel bad and I apologised. He then said the least I could do, after telling me all the things he went through, was to be nice (I was nice earlier, listening and talking about it) and that his best friend would atleast give him a hug. I gave him a couch cushion to hug, because he was looking at my chest quite a lot earlier and frankly it just seemed like an excuse to feel me up.\n\nHe later admitted he reacted that way because I said no, but still talked as if sex was likely, despite my clear rejection.\n\nI've noticed that the most unsafe scenarios I've been in, were when men have tried to exploit my kindness and interest in men's mental health.

However, this gender gap in higher education doesn't exist, or is far less significant within Asian communities. From this, can't I conclude that the issue of a gender gap in higher education isn't a systemic problem, but rather a problem of merit?

But like\u2026 ARE you different from those other guys?? Are you \u201cone of the good ones\u201d now that you\u2019ve acknowledged how \u201cgross and creepy\u201d other guys can be??\n\nOr am I over analyzing it?? It makes me feel bad thinking this way because I don\u2019t want to turn men away from supporting feminism, but I also think \u201cquality over quantity\u201d if that makes sense.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a reverse of this happen on a podcast, where a group of men said something like \u201cwomen are so annoying\u201d and a female guest was like \u201cyeah, I\u2019m a women and I agree other women can be so annoying\u201d \u2014 like just trying to ingratiate herself to the group by throwing others under the bus \u2014 so maybe seeing a guy say this about other guys made me feel the same as if a women was saying this about other women\u2026\n\nOr am I crazy and there\u2019s nothing there \ud83d\ude2d?? Am I reading too much into it??\n\nAnd for another example, on a different subreddit, a women made a post about how she was insecure about her body (basically she had small boobs and all her friends had big boobs, and she was sad about it etc)\n\nAnd the responses from women ranged from women who also had small boobs sharing how they learned to love their bodies or from women giving fashion tips on how to style when you have small boobs etc \n\nMeanwhile the responses from men were mostly \u201cwell im a guy and I love small boobs lol\u201d but there was one guy in particular that basically said something like \u201cyou need to step outside the patriarchy and not see yourselves through a patriarchal lens and just exist as you are blah blah\u201d something like that-\n\nAnd that comment bothered me so much \ud83d\ude2d , like how are you - a man - lecturing a women on how she should view her body and insecurities and the patriarchy?? \n\nLike women are allowed to be insecure first off because they\u2019re shaped from birth by the media and beauty industry and culture to feel a certain way about their bodies because they don\u2019t have this that or the third, one cannot simply \u201cstep outside the patriarchy\u201d and \u201cview yourself as is\u201d with the snap of a finger overnight, it can literally be a lifelong thing- \n\nSo to hear a guy say \u201cforget the patriarchy\u201d to a women is so\u2026 upsetting \ud83d\ude2d like yeah I think we should all \u201cforget the patriarchy\u201d but like\u2026 we as a society literally cannot overnight\n\nLIKE IDK, am I crazy??

Not controlling for the same jobs or experience, working women make approximately 22% less than men.\n\n* **Glass ceiling** - Women are less likely to be promoted, especially to executive roles.\n\n* **Confidence** - Women are less likely to be assertive and\/or confident in mixed company, often due to reactions from men, upbringing and taught gender roles.\n\n* **Work\/life balance** - Women are likely to fall behind men in work experience due to giving birth and child rearing duties.\n\n* **Domestic chores** - Women (even working women) are more likely to be responsible for more domestic chores\n\n* **Credibility** - Women are not as often believed or seen as credible or competent. Ex. mechanic shops, conference rooms, and by health professionals.\n\n* **Health care** - Clinical studies often underrepresent women, and care\/medicine is geared towards men.\n\n* **Design** - Commercial goods are often designed with men\u2019s body size or needs in mind instead of women\u2019s (ex. chairs, seatbelts, tools, etc)\n\n* **Pink Tax** - Products marketed to women are more expensive than similar products marketed towards men.\n\n* **Interrupting** - It is seen as socially acceptable to interrupt women.\n\n* **Beauty standards** - Disparity in time, money and energy expected in maintaining hygiene and appearance.\n\n* **Boys club** - Women are often socially excluded from social groups in power.\n\n* **Leadership** - Women are underrepresented in leadership positions of virtually all kinds.\n\n* **Financial Dependence** - Making less money often means a financial reliance on men, which often limits women\u2019s choices.\n\n* **Abortion** - Legal bodily autonomy constantly on the chopping block.\n\n* **Sexual shaming** - Too much sex, banter, or risque clothing is disparaged\n\n* **Sexual duties** - Pressure to satisfy male sexual urges.\n\n* **Religion** - Often put in diminutive roles in religion\n\n* **Duty to care** - Seen as disproportionately responsible to physically and emotionally care for friends and family\n\n* **Smile more** - Duty to always be upbeat\n\n* **Objectification** - Seen as objects instead of people by men.\n\n* **Pressure to wait** - Women are expected to not take initiative in romantic relationships.\n\n* **Education** - Women are less likely to get degrees in high paying fields like STEM.

I notice a radio silence. Well perhaps one man did, I'm not sure if I can tell correctly that person's gender, but a deep, very obvious quietness. (If not proactive misogyny, some of the man say sexist things when not interacting with feminists and seem to only talk about \"gender equality\" to incur debt from feminist)\n\n(There are some men which seem to be normal people if you look at post history at least, tbh if a man has no misogny in post history that is news to me now, however there are some men can still interact normally with women as people and tbh if I can't tell you from female feminist from comment or you call out strange behavior from other male feminists (which is part of this tbh), then you are among the best imo, sorry for giving my opinion randomly but only partially. Occasionally I will see a man who isn't involved in feminist Reddit spaces but will call out misogyny and seem to understand how it functions as systemic oppression, this is a cool kind of guy tbh but they seem to be few)\n\nI've noticed for a long time that in comments section with much misognyy, the few commenters defending women, you can click on their profiles and see that they are women in their content (for example, posts) but there are very few men defending. Almost never there is a man defending women, only women are defending women, I played this game because it is a good way to see what men do when they are not under scrutiny from women and have nothing to gain from keeping up appearances (for example, women's good will, something they can use as leverage to keep feminists' attention to men, etc.), but then support vanishes to (almost?) nothing, I don't count marches and stuff tbh because they can go there performatively, I suppose they can call out other men performatively when they are on male-dominated subreddits but I can't read their minds there and at least they will only be performing for themselves and not women, tbh if mind reading was possible this question about sincerity of men would be answered immediately and I imagine there would be a huge riot lol.\n\nIt's because I see many men who ask for feminists to police their own, but I think, do they do this work themselves or are they asking for more labor than they're wiling to give, which they say is \"gender equality\" but actually it is only unequal labor again,\n\nI think it is not all men who actively do raping, violence where they may face serious consequences, but if you ask how many men will fight back if new order was put in place where legal consequences disappeared? For example, if US was taken over by fundamentalist Christianity (like Iran and Afghanistan with Islam), how many men will help women instead of just accepting a new servant. I worry that there are men who treat women like coworkers now, equals nowadays in public view, they smile at women and exchange workplace banter, never say sexist things, and maybe even are convinced that they are good people, but if situation changes, would they would accept female subjugation with equal complacency, if you understand. In that case, how many men in the \"not all men\" group, number shrinks down to tiny amount I imagine.\n\n(I say tiny amount because we do hear some stories of boys acting in solidarity with girls in school, of men protesting the Taliban in Afghanistan, but it makes me wonder as Taliban also oppresses men, could just be convenient that such protests help women too but still men are really doing it for themselves.... and idk much about boys helping girls in schools, actually, I think more of \"your body, my choice\" and sexual harassment\/assault of girls tbh)\n\nThis is also inspired by stories of Peace Corps assaulting women, what happens to men who go to war and then they have free license to do what they want with women, I'm sure these are nice guys when they are in their home country but when no more consequences, they do what they want to do. As an atheist said to a Christian, \"I do as much raping and killing as I want, zero\", but how many men say such things but actually they would do something when there are no consequences, it is impossible to know. Even irl men will seem nice, but on Internet they say nothing or misogynistic things when no reward for being anti-sexist and that is just social anonymity. If there is sexual satisfaction or a reward for dominating, who knows how many will actively harm women, let alone try to help them.....\n\nAnd as for the icing on the cake, whenever you see misandrist sayings even in women-centered space, there are always many women who stand up, say \"you misandrist\", multiple objectors, but the reverse is not true. I set the same standard for women and men here--if no women objected to misandry, maybe I wouldn't care so much, but women do stand up for men even when they receive no benefit and the same just isn't true for men when there is misogyny.\n\nThis is related post btw: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/lgelzr\/gentle\\_reminder\\_to\\_the\\_ladies\\_on\\_here\\_the\\_men\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/lgelzr\/gentle_reminder_to_the_ladies_on_here_the_men\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI got the idea from this post as well. Feel free to play the game yourself too if you have not already, see men when they are in other spaces or notice lack of pushback. And if you show me many examples, I will change my mind about this observation, but for now I think there isn't such support from men.\n\nYes, I know small sample and perhaps biased from only Reddit, but I will challenge to find even one post which fits parameters tbh, you can pick own sample and search as hard as you want, show some men who stand up for women without benefit to themselves like women's approval and I will be pleasantly surprised.

Women took off from the plates of men and added to theirs. It's the rule mother's work now and it's still the rule that mother's do the majority of childcare and housework.  \n\nFeminists played a sole role in getting the FBI to expand its definition to include male rape victims.\n\nFeminists played a sole role in opening a men's battered shelter.\n\nFeminists have played a major role in bringing awareness to toxic masculinity and harmful gender constructs that negatively effect men.\n\nAnd while feminists were doing this, men's groups\/movements just kept talking ad nauseam about their feelings on men's issues.  Most groups\/movements were abusing, terrorizing, and trying to invalidate feminists.  The movement that was doing good things to try and help men.  That was the return for feminists investing in men's issues.\n\nAnd so I fear, that men's groups whether they are alt right or claim to be progressive have become so comfortable in sitting back, creating for themselves a luxury they nor society in general can afford.  Men's issues don't just negatively effect men, their issues effect everyone in society negatively. They tend to destroy anything in it's path.  So as feminists, we don't have the luxury of sitting back and doing nothing.  But I don't see men's movements\/groups jumping in anytime soon to do their part.  I just see them talking about their feelings regarding them, for eternity.  And that scares the hell out of me.  \n\nAnyone else feel the same?  Any ideas on how to convince men to actually do their part instead of just cranking out terrorist hate groups to try and solve issues and do more than just talk?

I was in front of the line, my hands full of groceries, and my bf was behind me. However, the cashier addressed my bf saying \"Sir, come to my checkout\". He didn\u2019t even look at me, although I was literally in front of him, and I was holding the groceries. You may think that\u2019s not too bad, but I noticed this is an ongoing issue:\n\nA few days ago, I was walking around with my bf, and we both stopped to let a man on a bike cross the road. While I was directly facing the man, he looked at my boyfriend and said \"thanks man\", before leaving. He didn\u2019t even look at me.\n\nPrior to that, I was visiting a small town with my\nbf, and a dog came to greet us. I love dogs, so I started petting it. The owner, a man, started telling us (I thought, but apparently only my bf) about the dog. I answered that her name was nice, that the dog was very sweet, etc, and at the end of the conversation I ended up saying to the man \"thank you very much sir, have a good day\". He didn\u2019t answer, and did not even bother looking at me. But the moment my bf said \"have a good day sir\" the man answered \"thank you, you too\". Now the thing is that all of this happened in French, and the guy used the pronoun \"you\" in its singular form. It clearly was not directed to me. The guy literally ignored me in my face.\n\nLast but not least: I was in an airbnb with my bf, and the owner called my phone to give us some directives on our checkout. He spoke English, and although I am not native, I study in England and am very fluent in English. My bf is French, and although he has a good English it obviously is not comparable. However, the man on the phone kept yelling at me saying he didn\u2019t understand anything I was saying (he would not let me speak tbh). At that point, my bf just took the phone out of my hands and magically the guy on the phone stopped yelling, calmed down, and engaged in a discussion with my bf.\n\nThose are just a few examples of times when I felt invisible, and as this only happens when I\u2019m with men (most of the time my bf) and never with women, I believe it has something to do with me being a woman. I complained about this to the men in my surroundings, and although they believe me (if I don\u2019t speak about it too much they\u2019ll let me talk about it), they never seem to notice it themselves. I\u2019m just so mad, and so mad that my men don\u2019t even notice this when it happens, just because he does not have to. Has any of you been through similar experiences?\n\n1st Edit: thank you all for your answers, it\u2019s really cool (although really sad as well) to know I am not the only one noticing this, and I appreciate the support \u2661\n\n2nd Edit: I have had many comments asking about my bf\u2019s and my profile. Regarding him, he is not intimidating, and actually quite shy when it comes to social situations, especially in shops. I myself am neither intimidating (very basic height, weight and style) nor shy (I do stand up for myself when needed, but the people I mention in this post have no way of knowing that). And I don\u2019t think this comes into play, as I have had this feeling on the phone, where the person we are talking to  cannot know what we look like. Also, now that we are wearing face masks because of the covid, I believe facial features are not part of the equation.\n\n3rd Edit: Spelling\/Grammar\n\nAlso wanted to add: no matter how many times and how hard dickheads made you, or make you, feel invisible, you are not!!","title":"Are women invisible next to men?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/igadhj\/are_women_invisible_next_to_men\/"}

No. It was bad in that aspect.\n\nBoth books are about women getting their rightful revenge on the evil, horrible rapist men and looking pretty cool doing it. That's... It.

Men get to do it all the time and they make for incredibly well written characters. \n\nWhy aren't women allowed to be evil?\n\nFemale authors and male authors all have the biggest chance to do so.

Cruella, Dolores Umbridge. They are evil for the sake of being evil.\n\n2: Most of the male protagonist villains have a cult following and are analysed to death. I don't usually see the same for female protagonist villains, mostly because said ones either don't exist to the extent of male protagonist villains, or that they aren't written with as much complexity.

I could go on about not being taken seriously, feeling threatened by men, and issues such as abortion laws and reproductive rights, but those are discussed here often and you all are familiar with that.

I hate that women are on average less strong than men, and women have to work much harder and eat a lot less to have the same fitness and strength as men. I hate the little pouch of fat around the uterus. Personally I hate having hormones that make me suicidal the week before my period.\n\nAll in all, I don\u2019t see anything good about being a woman, biologically or socially.

But, before that, question.\n\nDo you think men are intimidated by highly educated women? Yes or no? Why?\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nIn this study, we examine the impact of an individual's education level on her\/his mating success on the mobile dating app Tinder. To do so, we conducted a field experiment on Tinder in which we collected data on 3,600 profile evaluations. In line with previous research on mating preferences from multiple fields, our results indicate a heterogeneous effect of education level by gender: while women strongly prefer a highly educated potential partner, this hypothesis is rejected for men. In contrast with recent influential studies from the field of economics, we do not find any evidence that men would have an aversion to a highly educated potential partner. Additionally, in contrast with most previous research \u2013 again from multiple fields \u2013 we do not find any evidence for preferences for educational assortative mating, i.e. preferring a partner with a similar education level.\n\n[https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0272775719301104](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0272775719301104)","title":"Are men intimidated by highly educated women?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1bxfyac\/are_men_intimidated_by_highly_educated_women\/"}

For example if a couple chose to film them having sex (normal sex, not the over exaggerated, and porn-like kind) that means they both want to do it and it is consensual. \n\nEven though her arguments are very factual and I understand them, I\u2019m still indifferent in some ways.

Porn upholds that women are an object that you can consume, and by watching porn you get an overall objectifying view on women.

Specifically, I've found it to resemble what heterosexual sex culture would look like if the sexual revolution was not accompanied by second wave feminism. \n\nIt is known that gay men have an unfortunate tendency to replicate heteronormative relationship dynamics, with the top having the 'man' role and the bottom having the 'woman' role. While there are (fortunately) many gay male couples who deviate from this template, its prevalence should not be underestimated. For example, tops are expected to 'host' and foot bills. Don't even get me started on how 'feminine tops' are more of a cryptid in gay communities than someone you actually meet. Even in r\/gaybroscirclejerk (supposedly a sub that looks down upon how gay male culture manifests on reddit), many posts can be found that reference the stereotype of the 'hysterical bottom'. If bottoms really are commonly the 'woman' analogue in gay male relationships, then I am concerned (for mostly sex-related reasons).\n\nThe overarching impression I get from discussions about gay sex from gay men is that its much more heirarchical than straight (or even lesbian) sex: doms are much more dominant and subs express slightly more agency than a sex doll. I can't tell you how many times I've seen it normalised for bottoms to not receive oral sex, or even have orgasms. It seems that most ideas surrounding (non-power) bottoming in gay male sex amount to 'let him use you for his pleasure'. That last one in particular is especially concerning, as a significant amount of bottoms in a particular gay sex discussion subreddit (which I will not name to avoid brigading), when asked what they like their top to do, say things to the effects of \"whatever they enjoy\". \n\nNow the obvious reply is \"So what? They like these things.\" But keep in mind the very important term used in this sub's seventh rule: 'deformed desires'. r\/feminism often discusses the normalisation of choking and other violence in 'vanilla' straight sex, and how it leads to unhealthy practices. While there are, naturally, disagreements in these discussions, one of the main consensuses is that what you might think you 'just like' is actually learned from cultural expectations. No notable discourse exists for this kind of normalisation in gay male porn. \n\nThe fact is that gay men are not actually as free to have their own preferences as you might hope. While \"no fats, no femmes, it's just a preference sweaty\" is so commonplace it's practically a meme, you won't find any comments like [the ones in this thread](https:\/\/twitter.com\/charliekirk11\/status\/1408503979550547971) in gay subreddits. My guess is that women feel more comfortable stating that they don't like how penises (or male bodies in general) look, or that they don't like giving blowjobs, because they've been given permission to push back against patriarchal sex expectations by other women. No such permissions exists for gay men (as implying gay men experience pseudo-misogyny is admittedly a weird proposition). \n\nDespite the inevitable calls for women to stay out of gay men's sex lives, the fact is that feminism requires confronting the normalisation of patriarchy **wherever it may be**. Besides, it's not like gay male culture doesn't have a history of actual misogyny.","title":"To what degree do you think gay men have internalised patriarchal ideas relating to sex?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/o8aiyq\/to_what_degree_do_you_think_gay_men_have\/"}

I'm not writing a paper here so I apologise what follows is mostly a bunch of disorganised snippets, but I wanted to provide some context and refs into what is a very superficially obscured, muddled and interwoven shitstorm. \n\nI do not necessarily think these organisations are in cahoots 24\/7, but it's important to note how it's not unusual for them to occasionally share members or directors, that they legitimise each other through cross-linking and mutual endorsement, share stages - and I'm willing to bet that each high profile furore around trans rights, health, children, education, etc can be traced back to one of these groups being somehow involved at the conception.\n\nHere are some of the players I've seen come up repeatedly (i.e. organisations involved in various anti-trans developments, consulted as experts either by relevant public bodies or for constructing legislation, consulted as expert in the media, responsible for some of the court cases that paved the way to all of this) and examples. Links are to Trans Safety Network and similarly aligned publications or web archive versions when not possible:\n\n* [SEGM (Society for Evidence Based Gender Medicine)](https:\/\/transsafety.network\/posts\/segm-uncovered\/)\n* [GenSpect 1](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20240606190507\/https:\/\/genspect.org\/what-genspect-has-done-our-50-achievements-so-far\/), [Link 2](https:\/\/transsafety.network\/posts\/genspect-misleading-letters\/)\n* [ADF UK](https:\/\/truthout.org\/articles\/anti-abortion-campaigns-are-gaining-traction-in-the-uk-with-help-from-us-cash\/) ('Funded by US cash' heading if you wanna skim)\n* [LGB Alliance](https:\/\/www.thepinknews.com\/2022\/09\/14\/lgb-alliance-transphobia-charity-history\/)\n* Transgender Trend\n* Bayswater Support Group\n* Woman's Place UK\n* Sex Matters (started by the one and only Maya Forester)\n\nThere are so many more examples but it'd take a spreadsheet for me to track. These names, and the names of some of their members come up again and again once you start fact-checking instead of taking reportage at face value - the inter-connections between them are pretty crazy. \n\nI think the key theme in all of this is that a lot of these organisations are doing all of this *while claiming to care about trans people* and employing a lot of corporate DE&I speak. To a casual, unfamiliar observer, there is a big risk of misinterpreting these fringe groups as genuinely representing the interests of a \"significant\" portion of the LGBTQ+ community who have been \"silenced\" by the \"woke agenda\". So they fly under the radar and confuse the public into complicity.\n\n**Their meddling and impact:**\n\n1. **The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC),** UK's equality watchdog. It's apparently seen a rise in anti-LGBT and particularly anti-trans ideology, lots of people have quit, investigation went nowhere, their briefing on trans issues invited only Stonewall (the largest UK LGBTQ+ org) along with 3 TERF organisations. Some leaks and summaries: [Link 1](https:\/\/www.thecanary.co\/uk\/analysis\/2023\/05\/26\/the-misconduct-investigation-into-the-ehrcs-kishwer-falkner-was-over-before-it-even-began\/) [Link 2](https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/wxdzwn\/ehrc-trans-rights-leaked-emails)\n\nThey have a (now a lot more buried than before) 'register of interests' page where the board members\/commissioners publish their potential conflicts of interests. As one example, there's **Akua Reindorf**, who is:\n\n* currently representing **James Esses** who was dismissed from his psych course and also allegedly attempted to \"change kids' minds\" about being trans while volunteering as ChildLine\n* currently representing **LGB Alliance** to uphold its charitable status - challenged by Mermaids UK\n* currently representing an anonymous claimant in another case against a university in relation to her \"gender critical beliefs\"\n* is  advising a university as to the legality of its policies relating to trans staff and students\n\nAkua Reindorf also authored the **Reindorf Review** criticising the withdrawal of invitation of **Jo Phoenix** and **Rosa Freeman** as speakers at a university after backlash from students due to their transphobic views. This ultimately led to an apology by the university due to the ongoing impact of the Maya Forster appeal. Rosa Freeman [doxxed a student who sent her a letter stating their opposition to her views](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20240103133859\/https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-9736211\/Professor-shares-letter-Reading-student-warning-gender-critical-talks-problematic.html).\n\nJo Phoenix started the \"Gender Critical Research Network (GCRN)\" at the Open University, again protected by the impact of the Forester case. \n\nTheir currently lined up speakers include Philip Stokoe (who staunchly opposes gender-affirming practice in therapeutic and counselling settings) and Lisa Marchiano (who helped co-author \"When kids say they're trans\", a parenting book that supports the use of conversion therapy. She also peddled her support for the illegitimate study that coined the term ['Rapid onset gender dysphoria'](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rapid-onset_gender_dysphoria_controversy) which is significantly damaging cause of her own credentials).\n\nSidebar about the Maya Forester case, btw. Despite her losing her original case, with the presiding judge stating that her approach \"is not worthy of respect in a democratic society\", the EHRC decided to involve themselves in her appeal, which she won. This opened the floodgates to many similar cases and essentially more difficulty de-platforming individuals and organisations whose sole focus seems to be targeting trans people, peddling illegitimate research as \"science\", and essentially opening doors for more legal challenges to employers who want to support trans people (many of whom, including in the NHS and civil service, continue to work to create safer environments for trans people and it's laughable how at odds it is with the impression you'd get from news coverage).\n\n2. I probably don't need to talk too much about the **Cass Review**, but some of the evidence cited came from materials and studies funded by some of the above lobby groups, Hilary Cass met with their reps, etc. [Some comments](https:\/\/ruthpearce.net\/2024\/04\/16\/whats-wrong-with-the-cass-review-a-round-up-of-commentary-and-evidence\/)\n\n3. Continued efforts: lobbyists at the **Royal College of Psychologists International Congress 2024**: [Link 1](https:\/\/transsafety.network\/posts\/rcpsych-congress-anti-trans-lobbyists\/) [Link 2 ](https:\/\/transsafety.network\/posts\/rcpsych-suppressing-questions-congress\/)\n\n4. Attacks and the undermining of trans health services and charities, e.g. Tavistock, Mermaids, Stonewall with narratives supported by the British mainstream press. Re: the Bell v Tavistock case which led to the shutting down of the clinic, Transgender Trend were involved in the court case. \n\nOther things to read: [https:\/\/transsafety.network\/posts\/bell-v-tavistock\/](https:\/\/transsafety.network\/posts\/bell-v-tavistock\/)\n\nSo over the past few years, they've stuck their fingers into high-level organisations like the EHRC, undermined existing support services and charities, helped put forward legislation that would see legal protections for trans people eroded, fucked with trans healthcare via the Cass Review which in turn has had a huge influence on all sorts of professional health standards bodies across medicine & psychology, were involved with the sports debacles, etc. \n\nIt sounds insane - but here we are. And it's not that articles on this don't exist on mainstream sites - but they're few and drowned out by the noise of sensationalist, misinformed and disinforming anti-trans reportage instead.\n\nSo I guess I \"know\" how we got here - but a lot of people who oppose transphobia look at what's going on, agree it's awful and express anger, and stop there as far as questioning it goes. While to my eyes there's a funded manipulation campaign going on, before the dust of fake news and Cambridge Analytica has even settled, most of us are sitting here watching it unfold like it's another brief inevitable but ultimately temporary political shitstorm to weather.\n\nMy ex-partner always taught me to ask \"Who benefits?\" and pay attention to funding sources, and it's a lesson I apparently took to heart, but even I know I sound like a conspiracy nut talking about this. I guess I keep waiting for more UK-based people who are better informed, placed and qualified than I am to call these things out.\n\nEither way, what I believe as it stands is that trans rights are being attacked as a wedge issue to get some of these people in the door. These orgs aren't all aligned on everything. I believe their targets later on will become an attempt to rollback rights for queer people and reproductive rights. It's just that in the UK trans people happened to be the easiest target to start with.

The guy would find a woman they are interested in, form an ideal version of this girl in his mind based on his backgroung, go talk to her and try to develop something, possibly escalate to a relationship and then start to learn that she is a person just like him with flaws and a past and them face a dilemma when confronted with reality.

I\u2019m sharing this because I\u2019d really appreciate a feminist lens on a situation that left me confused and uneasy. I want to make sure I\u2019m holding myself accountable, but also protecting my authority and integrity.\n\nRecently, a white woman I supervise (let\u2019s call her \u201cK\u201d) decided to do an in-person check-in with a client. The client had not requested the visit\u2014it was something K chose to do proactively. She planned to take along another coworker she\u2019s very close friends with. The visit was announced last-minute in a group chat, without informing me directly beforehand.\n\nWhen I asked about it, she said she felt \u201cunsafe\u201d going alone. I suggested she consider taking another colleague\u2014let\u2019s call him \u201cD\u201d\u2014instead. D is a tall Black man with extensive experience doing field visits, especially with harder-to-reach or more complex clients. I said something like, \u201cMaybe bring D\u2014he\u2019s a big guy and used to this kind of situation.\u201d I then mentioned his role and experience.\n\nK ignored the suggestion and went with her friend anyway.\n\nLater, during a one-on-one, she told me that my suggestion felt racist and sexist\u2014because I referenced D\u2019s physical size and he\u2019s a Black man. I was surprised and taken aback. As a woman of color, I take these concerns seriously, but I also felt like the accusation came out of context and without acknowledging the practical reasoning behind my suggestion. D was not offended when I checked in with him\u2014he was confused about the situation entirely.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, K has a history of undermining my leadership\u2014ignoring procedural expectations and communication norms, failing to notify me of schedule changes, etc. This situation feels like part of a pattern where she resists accountability and cloaks it in progressive language. I also couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was speaking for a Black man, assuming what he would feel, which felt paternalistic and aligned with what some people call \u201cwhite savior\u201d behavior.\n\nI\u2019ve documented the incident with HR and my director (who supports me), but I declined to escalate it into a formal investigation. I didn\u2019t want to turn this into something bigger than it needed to be\u2014unless it continues.\n\nMy questions:\n\t\u2022\tHow do feminist frameworks help us think about these power dynamics when race, gender, and professional hierarchy intersect?\n\t\u2022\tHow do I protect myself against weaponized \u201cprogressive\u201d language while still being open to accountability?\n\t\u2022\tAnd\u2026 how do I not internalize the self-doubt that comes when my leadership is questioned in this way?\n\nThanks for reading. I\u2019d really love to hear how others\u2014especially feminist leaders of color\u2014have navigated similar dynamics.\n\nEdit: Hey everyone \u2014 just wanted to say a big thank you for all the comments on my previous post. I\u2019ve been reading them carefully and they\u2019ve really helped me feel less alone and more clear about how to move forward.\n\nA few things came up in the thread that I wanted to respond to:\n\t\u2022\tFirst off, no \u2014 there\u2019s no official protocol in my agency for how to do home visits (yet), and this situation made it very clear we need one. I\u2019m planning to sit down with my supervisor and draft something that could be used not just by my team, but maybe others in the agency too.\n\t\u2022\tA lot of folks asked about the client. Just to clarify: the client didn\u2019t ask for this visit, and wasn\u2019t even home when they went. It was not a scheduled or requested visit.\n\t\u2022\tPeople also asked about safety. The client has never acted violently or posed any threat to anyone on our team. The reason this staff member gave for \u201cfeeling unsafe\u201d was that the client\u2019s neighbors and people living with them seemed \u201ca little weird\u201d (her words, not mine). So when I asked, \u201cokay then what\u2019s the real concern?\u201d, her answer was basically, \u201cWell, in my previous organization, we\u2019d always take a buddy.\u201d \n\t\u2022\tShe refused to acknowledge that anything was inappropriate \u2014 and that\u2019s when she suddenly accused me of being sexist and racist because I had originally suggested bringing a male coworker instead of her friend.\n\t\u2022\tHonestly, what\u2019s starting to bother me more than anything is the white saviorism I\u2019m seeing in her.\n\t\u2022\tOne comment that really stayed with me was someone saying that when Black men receive these kinds of inappropriate or loaded comments, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re okay with it \u2014 it\u2019s that they\u2019ve just learned to tolerate it. That really hit me, and I\u2019m going to talk more with my coworker about it. I truly want to hear how he feels, and if there\u2019s anything I need to reflect on or adjust, I absolutely will.\n\nThanks again for all the thoughtful insights. Some of the comments honestly opened my eyes even more. I\u2019ll keep you posted if anything new happens.","title":"As a woman of color in a leadership role, how do I respond when my authority is framed as racist or sexist by a white woman I supervise?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1lh5c8g\/as_a_woman_of_color_in_a_leadership_role_how_do_i\/"}

I was chilling on Instagram and I saw a close friends story of one of my closest male friends, which we will name Nathan. He posted that he thought it was fine calling feminists \"feminazis\" which absolutely shooked me. I started debating with him about why I felt dissapointed about that comment and why he shouldn\u2019t use or promote that term but he didn't understand at all so I gave up. I literally started crying because I didn't knew that Nathan, a friend of mine since middle school, had such an ignorant mind. I never noticed any sexist behaviour, in fact, he claimed to support many feminist values.  \n\n\nAnyhow, what happened with Nathan made me really sad. I don't have much male friends because most of the guys I know are totally assholes so I really aprecciated our friendship, so when he said that I felt betrayed. Most of my friends are girl friends because I feel much comfortable with them. Little by little I got away from him, stopped talking to him as I used to.

What always gets me isn\u2019t the content of the videos it\u2019s the creators behind them. Always, it\u2019s a white woman, usually American, who has dedicated her *entire* channel to ripping Meghan Markle apart.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean one or two videos. I\u2019m talking about *years\u2019* worth of content\u2014video after video, thumbnail after thumbnail, where Meghan is the subject. Every sigh she lets out, every outfit she wears, every word she speaks is dissected with this creepy, obsessive energy. It\u2019s disturbing. It\u2019s not normal.  \n\nThese aren\u2019t news channels. These are hate channels. Entire pages built on one woman\u2019s existence. Like, do these people not get tired? Filming, editing, and uploading videos isn\u2019t some quick task. You have to sit down, consume her content (which you allegedly *hate*), then spend hours analyzing it, writing scripts, voicing them, and uploading them\u2014for *years*. That\u2019s not criticism. That\u2019s obsession disguised as commentary. That\u2019s *hatred* given a platform and a monetized schedule.  \n\nAnd let's be clear it\u2019s always the *same type* of person. A white woman. An American white woman. And that part is even more baffling. Meghan is literally tied to the British royal family. Why do these Americans care this much? She's part of an institution that, frankly, has nothing to do with them. The irony of it all is that these women accuse her of \u201cplaying victim\u201d or \u201cattention-seeking\u201d while simultaneously dedicating their lives to making sure her name never leaves their mouths.\n\nThis isn\u2019t healthy. This isn\u2019t normal. It\u2019s not \u201cjust commentary.\u201d It\u2019s mental. It\u2019s weird that it\u2019s allowed to thrive, like there\u2019s nothing unhinged about producing 300+ videos about someone you don\u2019t know and supposedly *hate*. Some of these channels barely get that many views but these women are still committed..I haven\u2019t seen this happen with any other celebrity\u2014especially not to this extent, not with this level of obsession, not with this specific demographic.\nWhy is this behavior normalized? Why does it always follow the same racial and gendered lines? These women aren\u2019t critics. They\u2019re cyberstalkers with ring lights. At what point do we start calling it what it really seems to be?\nIf you hate someone this much, the last thing you should be doing is building your entire identity around them. But maybe the truth is, it\u2019s not even hate. I don't know what it is but either way, it\u2019s pathetic.  \nPs: Meghan markle is neither an angel nor a a demon I just think she's a normal person and every one of those videos I have come across has always confirmed that and I actually become fully distracted from focusing on whatever point the YouTuber is trying to put across and start wondering if the person has some mental health condition because they literally pick the most absurd things to overanalyze.

For example right now there is a trend going on where woman share things they belief are fine if a woman does it but cringe or disgusting if a man does it (Having a messy room, telling their partner what they are allowed to do, posting thirst traps, having no job or drivers license etc). \n\nMy problem is not necessarily the double standard, I mean it's just a meme and men say way worse stuff about woman, but that they are kind of infantilizing woman. It feels the same as the \"I'm just a girl\" stuff. They basically treat men like adults and women like children. When a woman has a messy room, no job or is a toxic partner they treat it as funny and quirky, but I feel like they are just playing into misogynistic stereotypes, by acting as I woman are not responsible for their actions.\n\nThere are also a lot of comments that are like \"aww a man wants to feel pretty and post pics of himself? What lipgloss does he use?\" Like in an attempt to trigger men. This again feels like perpetuating the societal norm, that girlish things are negative. If you make fun of men for doing feminine things you are playing into toxic masculinity.\n\nI guess you could argue that they just do in reverse what some men are doing. Like if men are saying boys will be boys or husbands act like they can't go grocery shopping because they don't know where anything is, they are essentially doing the same thing. They make stuff up so they don't have to take responsibility for anything. \n\nSo in conclusions I think even if these tiktoks try to be empowering, they are doing the opposite.\n\nEdit: Ok, just to make clear, I know the difference between women and feminist. But I think it's obvious that the trend tries to be feminist by talking about feminist problems. Also, it tries to empower women. So saying it has nothing to do with feminism is a bit odd\n\nEdit 2: I still believe they would call themselves feminist, but you guys are right, I could have worded that differently and shouldn't have assumed they want to do something feminist just because they are shitting on men","title":"Am I the only one who thinks that feminist trends on tiktok often end up becoming misogynistic?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1ik4vcz\/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_that_feminist_trends\/"}

I was never a huge Taylor Swift fan. I just don't tend to like popular stuff, never have. I've also always disliked Drake, Travis Scott, just about any country singer (male or female), boy bands, girl bands, all of it. This isn't a moral issue or anything like that, I just dislike the music and its overplayedness, and most of the popular people seem like dicks. Celebrities seem in general like assholes (I worked in an area where they came by often for film premieres. Fuck those entitled shitheads). Needless to say, since Taylor Swift has come under fire by the right (I literally do not know why) and therefore has become an icon for the mainstream American left*, she has become a popular \u201cfeminist\u201d figure to many of my friends.  \n\nSo, I was fairly shocked when I mentioned disliking Taylor Swift when her music came on and instead of being met with the typical \"Oh come on she has some good songs,\" I was met with \"You can dislike her music but you can't disregard what she's done for women.\" I know someone wrote a post about whether or not she is a \"feminist icon,\" but I'm more here to ask this question: *has she really done that much?* She's a rich, famous female musician. So is Beyonce. So is Lady Gaga. So is Jennifer Lopez. Hell, so is Mariah Carey. People are not out here demanding that those artists are the foundation of 21st century feminism. So what makes Taylor Swift different other than the fact that she happened to finally coincide with a major cultural revolution for the alt right? \n\n*I had previously said \u201cleft\u201d and didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up but I will specify. I mean the mainstream American left, which I understand is VASTLY different from the the \u201cleft\u201d in most countries.\n\nEdit: I changed the word \u201chate\u201d to \u201cdislike\/don\u2019t like\u201d because people have explained to me that hate is a very strong word to use. I usually don\u2019t think about it that much, but I understand what y\u2019all are saying and decided it doesn\u2019t reflect my true feelings. I should be more specific\/careful with my words.

One of the women responded with \u201cNot all men\u201d tangent and went on to talk about how many nice men she knows, which felt like it missed the point.\n\nI was talking about how sexual assault has deeply impacted me, making dating feel scary, and her response felt invalidating.

You\u2019ve all given me a LOT to think about. I have a lot of self-work to do but you\u2019ve all encouraged me so much, I feel like I can do this. \nI will take your advice and do what I can to find a good therapist that specializes in gender issues. I will learn to be ok with uncertainty and reject labels... and most importantly find out what makes *ME* happy and what *I* want out of life. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I would get so many great and loving responses. I\u2019m very very grateful for all of you and for this experience. I\u2019m feeling much better now. \n\nThank you all so very much \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been having a hard time dealing with this and I am exhausted. If I don\u2019t explain something coherently please let me know and I will try to do better. \n\nSome important background: I was raised in Puerto Rico in an independent fundamental baptist cult, specifically the Bob Jones University kind, so I was not only subjected to horrible teachings about gender roles from toddler age until my junior year of college, I was incredibly isolated from any other kinds of people, ideas, and ways of life. \n\nMy earliest thoughts on gender started when I was eight and found myself wishing that there was something I could be other than a man or a woman. Something in-between. I think I might have been frustrated, as my little tomboy self usually was, over the unfairness of always having to wear skirts and dresses and having to put up with playing Princesses or Tea Party with my sisters instead of Knights and Dragons like I wanted to.\n\nFrom the wife training classes I was made to take at 13, to always having my physical boundaries disrespected, to being taught that everything bad that happens in the world happens because a woman made a decision for herself, to watching independent women be called Jezebels, to having older men asking my father to \u201ccourt\u201d me (as a minor) and my parents seeing no issue with it aside from the fact they didn\u2019t want me to \u201ccourt\u201d anybody regardless of age until halfway through Bible college, to being encouraged by my Bible college professors to adopt anti-feminist ideology, and not to mention the trauma from sexual abuse... It\u2019s no wonder I\u2019ve had issues with my femininity. \n\nOnce I left Bible college and the cult and started educating myself on feminism, I started to feel much worse about myself. I hated my body. Seeing myself naked and being reminded that I have a \u201cfeminine\u201d figure with breasts made me sick. Male attention made me uncomfortable. Seeing women sexualized in any and every context made me mad, despite being attracted to women myself. I still experience these things now but I\u2019ve gotten a little better at stuffing them away. But no matter what I\u2019ve done, the depersonalization and hatred of my body and the agony of being seen as a woman have continued to haunt me. \n\nI\u2019ve cut my hair, I started binding and wearing men\u2019s clothes, and for a while I told everyone I was genderfluid. It helped for a little bit but I then realized that my \u201cdysphoria\u201d wasn\u2019t as bad as what real trans people go through and I stopped. There are also things about being a woman that I like now. I love having breasts in a sexual context, I love being feminine in the bedroom, I learned to love wearing dresses and makeup, and I really want to be a wife and mom someday. I feel like I couldn\u2019t have these things if I was trans. Maybe that\u2019s internalized transphobia, maybe not. I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t really care. Being trans isn\u2019t an option for me. With the way that trans people are treated in our society, specifically non-binary trans people who choose not to undergo HRT or gender affirmation surgery, why would I make my life harder than it has to be?\n\nBut the feelings I\u2019ve named \u201cdysphoria\u201d for so long still haven\u2019t gone away. Women being sexualized or sexualizing themselves still makes me uncomfortable. Being referred to as a woman still seems fundamentally wrong to me. I still hate my body for the most part. I\u2019ve never felt I belonged in groups of women and I don\u2019t have any friends who are cis women. I can\u2019t tell if these feelings are because I may still subconsciously believe that to be a woman is bad, or if I\u2019m simply not a woman at all. And I don\u2019t know how to find that out. \n\n\nI\u2019m just tired of feeling this way. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this even gender dysphoria? How do I become comfortable in my womanhood? \n\nThanks for reading this. Even if there\u2019s no solid solution, it\u2019s a relief to just vent and get this out here and see people\u2019s responses to it. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I was raised with toxic gender roles and suffered sexual abuse, now I have what appears to be gender dysphoria but might just be internalized sexism.

Then later in the same conversation, he said he was inexperienced with sex and just wanted to have casual sex with different partners to get experience and wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship right now. \n\nI told him that was hypocritical because in order to do that, he had to have a female partner, and by having casual sex with her, he\u2019d be adding to her numbers, which in his eyes, was detracting from her value and diminishing her eligibility for future partners so he could benefit, while he wouldn\u2019t experience the same drawback. Also that he was judging a woman for doing the same thing he wanted to do. He said he didn\u2019t know what to say and he realized it was probably wrong, but he couldn\u2019t help that that was how he felt. \n\nSo the next day I made a post on a forum about it, and a lot of male commenters basically agreed with him. To my statement about how it wasn\u2019t fair that to have casual sex with a woman, he was, by his logic, detracting from her value, a commenter said, \u201cIf I scratch a car that\u2019s already covered in dents and scratches, does it really matter?\u201d And that comment had a ton of upvotes, so I guess others agreed.

White feminism is that they mainly speak on topics that only affect them as women. For example, it was discourse about wanting to get into bimbofication, and wanting to dress and act like one. Now dressing I have no problem with, because me personally I LOVE dressing a little provocative and showing skin, blah blah blah. But the thing is, bimbofication only refers to white women. White blonde women were referred to as bimbos, not black women or Asian women. While white women deal with infantilization (which is an issue that needs to be discussed and dismantled), black women deal with hypermasculinization and dealing with being hypersexualized at a young age, yet that\u2019s something that is never talked about among other feminists who are not black or of color. White feminism and white feminists in general I feel like are 100% horrendous at intersectionality and constantly fail it because they are simply fighting for interests that benefit them and them only as a white woman. Black women are constantly out of the picture when it comes to feminism unless they are womanists or radfems (who aren\u2019t terfs) and it kinda angers me. With liberal and white feminism, their entire messsge and idea of feminism is \u201cto be equal\u201d, but their being equal is to be at the top. To be at the top of the oppressor chain, and fighting for a seat at an oppressive table. A table that is not so welcoming to black girls like me, black trans women or trans women in general, black queer women, or misogyny affected person who is NOT white. I don\u2019t want to necessarily be equal to a man because it makes me feel like I\u2019m nothing but an extension to a man. Am I wrong for feeling this way or criticizing this sort of feminism? What types of other feminism could I look into instead of mainstream feminism?

And even if women *do* statistically eat snack items more often than men for meals (but I don\u2019t know that they do)\u2026 why are we making this a term?? Lol\n\nIs this just further dividing the genders on more topics? Like, we\u2019ve already got men\u2019s sports and women\u2019s sports\u2014but why not men\u2019s dinner and women\u2019s dinner? Lol\n\nLet\u2019s just keep finding ways to divide us on gender neutral things:\n\n- Girl showers and boy showers\n- Boy aging and girl aging\n- Girl breathing and boy breathing\n- Boy sleeping and girl sleeping\n\n^ Surely there are stereotypical differences we can find for all those things. There\u2019s no REASON to, but we can do it.\n\nThen we can start memeing about it until the media picks it up, then maybe there can be advertisements specifically catered to these stereotypes, and finally hooraaaaay, we\u2018ve invented more societal molds for us to fit into instead of everyone just being individuals!! :D\n\nUnintentional reverse progreeeeessssss!! **WOOOOO!!!1!**\n\nThis also seems to (re)encourage under-eating and (potentially) malnutrition in women? Like, I know the term is (probably, hopefully) meant to convey \u201cenough snack items to constitute a proper meal and sufficient nutrients\u201d, but it certainly feels like \u201cOh! I couldn\u2019t possibly eat a steak or burger! Those are BOY DINNERS! I need to have yogurts and crackers and cheese for my meals, or I might gain weight! I\u2019m just a delicate, feeble flower, you know? I probably couldn\u2019t even FINISH such a big, manly boy dinner!\u201d Lol\n\nAnd I know I\u2019m speculating a lot and putting words into undefined entities\u2019 mouths, but (genuinely, the following is a question to be answered): \n\nWhat *else* could it be? What do you think the point, meaning, and implications of \u201cgirl dinner\u201d are? Is it harmless, harmful, borderline, just confusing? etc.?\n\nTo me, girl dinner has to be implying something about women; otherwise, it would just be called snack dinner instead of girl dinner, right? Whether the implications are harmful or not probably depends on the user, but whatever the case, it seems to be stereotyping (and\/or maybe some other things I\u2019m not seeing), but it all seems pointless at best.\n\nIt\u2019s like stealth misogyny since the mistreatment of women is so normalized, but imagine having the same naming conventions and the same stereotyping implications for [any other hot button group].\n\nImagine some popular influencer coins \u201cHomeless Dinner\u201d, and it consists of eating canned foods, taking food left over from others, and consuming anything at room temperature\u2014and the internet runs with this.\n\nTrends pop up like \u201cI ate nothing but Homeless Dinner for a week!\u201d, and the usual misinformation clout crowd comes out, like some body-builder going \u201cHomeless Dinner is why I look so robust!\u201d and inspirational nonsense like \u201cHomeless Dinner isn\u2019t a food, it\u2019s a mindset! You take what others don\u2019t want off their plate! You get anything you can whenever you can because you\u2019re an opportunist!\u201d Etc.\n\nThen media and various companies start advertising their lines of homeless food and Boujee, intentionally room temperature meals for $39.99\n\nThis probably wouldn\u2019t catch on\u2014at least not with the media\u2014because Society hasn\u2019t QUITE normalized the homeless situation yet enough to cluelessly make an insensitive stereotype meal based around it (this doesn\u2019t mean society is doing enough to help them or improve things btw, it just means people are at least aware enough to not do this), but the point is:\n\nThe above is fundamentally the same as girl dinner, I\u2019ve just made the issue a little more obvious by using homeless people instead of women\u2026\n\nBoth are taking something everybody does: Eats. \n\nAnd both are taking eating habits that everybody has done and will do: Eating canned food; taking food from others\u2019 plates; eating food at room temperature\n\nAnd both are just casual, trendy acceptances of\u2026 stereotypes?? Lol\n\nLike, I thought we as a society had sort of moved past accepting and advertising stereotypes at such a large level, but I\u2026 guess not?\n\nI guess if it seems harmless or funny enough it\u2019s fine??\n\nAnyway, this was a long-ass rant to say: I think this phrase sounds kind of misogynistic, and might be potentially harmful\u2014whether the creator of it intended\/realized that or not\u2014and it\u2019s weird that society has ran with it so hard that even the media and professional companies are picking it up lol\n\nAnyone else feel the same?\n\n\n#Edit: \n\nEdit because people are saying girl dinner is meant to be a progressive, satirical phrase to show that many women are so overextended they don\u2019t even have time to make proper meals for themselves\n\nBut the problem then is: I think the phrase has unfortunately already largely been misconstrued as literal, supported by the fact that official media (weightwatchers for instance) are using \u201cgirl dinner\u201d to advertise their healthy, small, dainty meal plans\u2026 for women.\n\nWhen official media and advertisements are getting it wrong, it\u2019s fairly likely a lot of other people are getting it wrong too. The problem too is satire and sarcasm are difficult things to convey over the Internet, especially in text.

My take on it is that if people that try to adopt have to go through this rigorous check before being granted a child, then why not apply the same standards for those that want to conceive as well?\n\nI'm from a \"socialist\" country in Europe and we have plenty of lazy people with neither the emotional intelligence nor the financial resources to ensure a normal life for a child but they go on to have 5-6-7-8 babies and then ask for social assistance which they use for drinking and anything other than providing adequate care for said child.\n\nTo meet them half-way I did say that these measures should be put in place along with providing education to that segment of people on sexual, psychological and financial issues but I would still apply said requirements.\n\nWhat is your take on this?\n\nLE: I think I need to clarify and add some things:\n\n1.

I mentioned the financial part because that is something personally important to me (I did not want to have children until recently because I believed I needed a certain level of income in order to ensure that my kid has a decent level of living and that my focus would be on the emotional side of upbringing and not worry about cash flow)\n5. I believe that the **most important part is the psychological and emotional part**. Because if \"there's a will then there's a way\" and parents who actually want and love their kids will find a way to provide for them.\n6. I inflated the number of babies to make a point. Obviously the majority of people do not reach the number of 5-6-7 people.\n7. After reading comments I agree that preventing people might not be ideal so maybe those \"tests\" would be used to flag people that exhibit characteristics of people that are more likely to create toxic or negative environments for children and have social services inspect those families post-birth more thoroughly to ensure the child is well taken care of without waiting for someone to report them.\n8. I was not suggesting to have the EXACT same standards for biological parents as for adopting ones but more that there should be some kind of \"testing\".\n9. I am not pointing to any race with my post (my neighbors are Roma and they are one of the most welcoming, well adjusted and hard working people I know and equally I know caucasian folks that are horrible human beings ).\n10. I agree that educating people would also be beneficial.\n11. Hope I did not offend anyone as that was not my intent.  \n\n\nLE2:  \n\n\n1. After reading your comments I concluded that indeed preventing someone from having kids is a form eugenics so I did retract my intial idea.\n2. What triggered my debate with my friends was me witnessing two \"parents\" raising their glasses of moonshine in rural area bar, celebrating that they receive child welfare that day.\n3. I don't believe poor people are inherently bad parents what I believe is that financial issues create emotional\/psychological issues.\n4.  Someone commented on making people take mandatory emotional therapy and parenting classes and that sounds great!\n5. Someone implied that I am privileged. My parents left the country when I was 13 (without me) and first two years of college I lived on the streets.

The discussion really piqued my interest, as I was a boy who had struggled immensely with academics up until I was diagnosed with severe Bipolar Disorder and received treatment for my illnesses. I had begun taking Lithium, which was the best choice of my life. I have been receiving treatment and therapy since I was 10 and I am now 19.\n\nI noticed that once I hit high school and began taking advanced classes, I almost always saw they were mostly dominated by females. I\u2019d say a 1:3 ratio of men to women. Even in my Psychology, Statistics, and History it was the same situation.\n\nI have some general guesses as to why many men seem to be struggling, like possibly the hormone Testosterone, video game addiction, loneliness, etc... But I feel the issue is probably much larger and a combination of these factors. Although it seems like the script has completely flipped from just about 30 years ago or so when it comes to performance in school of both men and women. How did such a large a drastic change take place in such a short period of time? I have also heard the that women seem to develop mentally quicker than men do, but I have also met some men who have a very high amount of emotional maturity and self control in their teen years (albeit, this trait is far more common among women than men). I also see that many younger men seem to be very sceseptible to online radicalization from the manosphere. Many men also seem to not question any of the claims made by these content creators at all.\n\nAnother factor I was curious about was the lack of male teachers and role models. Female teachers put in a massive amount of work to try and help these boys, but sadly I really think these teenage boys aren\u2019t going to listen to a female teacher. I feel awful for the shit that female teachers have to go through on a daily basis. I really feel this is more of a male-centered than an  a female issue. \n\nSo I was wondering what the feminist take would be on this, as I already asked something similar in r\/AskMen. Is it the socialization of men? Biological factors possibly? Is the school system having difficulty catering to men? How can schools implement some deradicalization program for young men? When should early intervention be initiated for boys and young men? How could we make it so that more males would choose a profession in teaching and healthcare? Also, what are some things men can do to help boys in school? What CAN I DO as a man to help other boys who are struggling? Again, this a multilayer issue, but I\u2019m curious to see another perspective.\n\nI apologize for the long post.

My interest isn't purely academic; in my country, real-world gender issues are constantly debated, like the military conscription system that overwhelmingly drafts men. I genuinely want to understand the feminist framework for these issues.\nHowever, I've run into what feels like a fundamental roadblock. I recently read an article by an author from a professional organization, the Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy. In it, she argues that \"gender equality is a white, overrated, and capitalist concept\" and makes the following statements:\n * \"I clearly draw the line at white cis men.\"\n * \"We should stop explaining to (white cis) men why feminism is beneficial for everyone. Because white cis men simply do not have to benefit from everything.\"\n * The role for white men is to \"take a step back, listen, and learn.\"\nMy purpose here is not just to express my frustration, but to proactively address the common rebuttals I anticipate, because I want to get to the core of the issue.\nMy honest reaction is that this language is deeply prejudiced and counter-productive. Before this is dismissed, let me explain:\n * On the definition of \"racism\/sexism\": I know the academic argument that prejudice requires systemic power to become racism or sexism. But let's not get stuck on semantics. Calling it \"prejudice\" or \"hostility\" instead of \"racism\" doesn't change the act itself. The act is still judging, dismissing, and drawing a line based on a person's immutable characteristics.\n * On \"It's not about you personally\": I also anticipate the argument that she's critiquing a \"structural category,\" not me as an individual. But this is a rhetorical shield. When you use a human demographic as a synonym for an oppressive power structure, you are knowingly targeting the individuals within that group. You can't aim a statement at \"white men\" and then claim individuals who are white men are wrong for feeling targeted.\n * On \"White Fragility\": Finally, I expect my reaction to be labeled as \"white fragility.\" This argument feels like a trap designed to silence dissent. My frustration isn't about losing privilege; it's a principled rejection of collectivist judgment based on race and gender. It's a rejection of the exact kind of thinking that anti-racism and feminism were supposedly created to fight against.\nThis isn't a random blog post; it's a viewpoint from an institutional source. And if a movement's message is so easily interpreted as hostile, the fault lies in the communication, not just in the reader's \"lack of context.\"\nSo, this leads me to my real questions for the feminists here:\n * What is your personal, honest reaction to this framework? Is this a viewpoint you see as valid, even if you don't fully share it?\n * Moving past the semantic games, how do you morally and strategically justify a movement for equality that uses such explicitly exclusionary and categorical language? How does one build a broad coalition for change on a foundation that alienates so many potential allies from the start?\n * What is the actual, practical path for engagement for someone like me? If the proposed role is to silently \"step back and listen\" to being categorically dismissed, how is that different from demanding subservience based on group identity? How can a movement built on this premise lead to anything other than more division and resentment?\nI'm asking in good faith because I am genuinely at a loss. I believe in equality, but I cannot engage with a framework that seems to fundamentally reject it in principle when it comes to my own demographic.\nThanks.\n\nSource: https:\/\/centreforfeministforeignpolicy.org\/2023\/03\/22\/cffp-monthly-feature-convincing-men-of-feminism-not-my-job\/","title":"How should I engage with feminism when prominent voices say they \"draw the line at white cis men\"?

And a large portion of them will see no benefit in marriage, not wanting to get married, or as I'm posting about, saying specifically it's a \"net negative\" for men. \n\nI'm trying to see when this shift occured. Because of course, not too long ago, marriage was kinda a necessity, at least for the woman. Again, I'm talking back before the 80s and 70s. Even if you didn't wanna get married, if you wanted anything for yourself(ownership, bank accounts, ect) you usually got married. \n\nIt almost seems, and I could definitely be wrong, that as soon as marriage became more of a choice for women(or women began just wanting it in general rather than NEEDING to), that suddenly men now see it as a \"negative\" for them. \n\nI'm wondering why this is? \n\nI've also looked up some statistics as far as marriage and the like. A lot of men bring up divorce rates that are initiated by women, and a lot will use that to say that they don't wanna get married. Gold diggers, taking their assets, the court being in favor of the woman in a divorce, ect ect. \n\nHowever again, in all these convos, they almost seem to absolve themselves of responsibility for divorce rates. At least myself, I know women usually aren't going through a lengthy and expensive divorce unless absolutely necessary. \n\nI won't go on a tangent though. I'm genuinely curious why so many men see no benefit to marriage, and will even try to talk other men out of marriage? I again think it has something to do with want vs. need, but I'm curious to hear other perspectives.","title":"Why do you think a lot of men suddenly see marriage as a \"net negative\" for them?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/17t0pne\/why_do_you_think_a_lot_of_men_suddenly_see\/"}

But the worst a man could be is like a rapist or serial killer. (There are some female rapists or murderers, but they are much more rare.)

I'm just saying that it's extremely rare compared to men. Even when they're both raised poorly or in the same bad environment (like the south side of Chicago, for example), men are much more likely to become gangbangers and violent criminals, while women from the same bad background are much more likely to just become sex workers. (I'm not saying that most men are violent criminals or that there are no male sex workers.)\n\nObviously, it would be worse for your hypothetical daughter to be a rapist or a serial killer than a sex worker; that goes without saying.

And dont get me wrong, that made me very happy and proud.  But my girls never got the same as it was just expected of them.  As a volunteer fireman I got compliments *all* the time.

And it's mostly from women.  Men get complimented from normal everyday parenting to a accomplishments in their careers.  And women are vastly ignored.\n\nIt's difficult to shoot down this nonsense because these guys believe men are already silenced and oppressed so when you call out their bullshit it feeds their victim complex.

How about asking how you can feel whole and connected to others in your life, and learn how to give, not just receive? \n\nonly partial tl;dr: \nif you wanna look at it in a silly gamified way romantic relationships are like level 10 of social interaction. If you can\u2019t even have pleasant enough interactions with women you\u2019re *not* trying to fuck, maybe you\u2019re not emotionally mature enough to attempt a long term relationship. That\u2019s not opppression; it\u2019s a part of growing up for ALL of us, regardless of gender by the way. There are men out there who understand that, and understand that that is an opportunity to mature and develop in a way that, ultimately, can only be beneficial to them in general. And again, we are all supposed to be doing that, it\u2019s literally called the passage of time and growing up lmao. Introspection seems to feel like a curse word to them. \n\nThe way a lot of men talk about \u201cgetting a date\u201d feels like an inherently misogynistic, objectifying conceit to me- to have a goal of \u201ctalking to *a* woman\u201d\/\u201casking out *a* woman\u201d for several reasons. First of all it sounds like talking about acquiring a specimen from a group of people instead of genuinely trying to interact with a human being. Does anyone know what I mean by that? It\u2019s like, they just lust after\/desire the idea of \u201chaving\u201d a woman, but they barely even *like* women! And the objectification goes beyond just being sexual in that way. I\u2019m struggling to explain, I can only say I can *feel* it when a man asking me out is a man asking out \u201ca woman\u201d as opposed to me, the individual. (That\u2019s not even talking about conflating horniness with loneliness and weaponizing that)\n\nIt feels like they are jumping to wanting to \u201cget\u201d a relationship before ever demonstrating that they can even be decent people to both men *and* women.\nIt implies that that man has a general goal of talking to ANY woman because the goal is not to form a real connection with a person, it\u2019s to \u201cget\u201d a date or \u201cget\u201d a relationship, like an item they want to feel more complete.\n\nAnother thing that underscores that is that they only ever think about approaching women with that goal in mind. It would never occur to them that women might be capable of being good friends and that men could form connections with women they aren\u2019t trying to fuck. We\u2019re not full humans to them, we\u2019re only there to serve as their sources of sex\/romance.\n\nAlso, there has been this insidious weaponization of therapy\/social justice language in order to gaslight women about enforcing their boundaries. \n\nSo for example, when men experience one axis of oppression such as autism(or other NDs), or racism, they are quick to weaponize that to gaslight women into transgressing their own boundary. They might not do this \u201cconsciously\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t make it less handful, nor do any women owe them a soft letdown, education, and therapy. This even goes for men inhabiting no marginalized identities- they will use the language of psychology\/social justice to create this picture of their lack of access to women being a grave societal injustice, and demand to be taken seriously for it. Mind you, very rarely do they even glance \u201cdownwards\u201d the social hierarchy to acknowledge the compounded oppression of women (and tbh people in general) who struggle with everything they struggle with *in addition to* gender, race, fatphobia, etc etc because their awareness of systematic factors ends where it stops being useful for them to present themselves as innocent victims. \n\n\neta I\u2019m pulling both from my personal experience as a Black autistic woman, experiences from many other people, and statistics.

The article discusses how this is unusual - in past generations there is a gender gap, but it is small.  One thing I thought was interesting was that while the other countries show men staying still or becoming more conservative while women become more liberal, in the UK both men and women are becoming more liberal, so women are becoming liberal faster.\n\nThe article suggests that this all stems largely from reactions to #MeToo, but I don't know that that really explains it.\n\nPerhaps more important is the consequences of this gap.  I don't relish the thought of liberal parties becoming the \"woman's party\" and conservatives the \"men's party.\"  Not to mention challenges that can arise in interpersonal relationships where marriages increasingly have divided ideologies.\n\nOne thought I have is that people are getting married later, so heterosexual marriages aren't blending together the lives of men and women as early.  I am somewhat optimistic about this.  I know since I've been married, my wife and I have converged on most issues.  I don't know if we're overall more \"left\" or \"right,\" but we're certainly both more to our own center.\n\nWhat are you're thoughts?  Why is this happening?  Does it worry you?

I'm not saying they simply \"accept\" everything I say as true but, rather, that they are easy to engage. Over the course of a year, I've seen all the girls in my three groups develop their own ideas on gender relations and feminity to a point that they can sustain a discussion on these topics among themselves or with me.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the men in all three groups seem to be avoiding the issue, parroting postures constantly. This worries me a lot. I've realized some of them have even learned to parrot \"woke\" or \"politically correct\" standpoints to avoid criticism while parroting other \"sigma male\" or \"incel\" postures internally.\n\nIt's worrying me a lot. I know from what I wrote that it probably looks like I'm too strict or like I go after male students over gender topics. Just want to clarify that this is not the case, I'm just trying to write concisely as possible.\n\nThe thing is that no matter how hard I try, I can't get men engaged on gender issues. Even by showing them things like how gender stereotypes affect them or how they can be victims of GBV. Most of them seem wholly uninterested.\n\nI don't know.

I think if a comedian made a super racist unfunny joke in a Netflix special (like if they literally said \"black people are dumb\"), you'd see a lot more people calling for the special to be removed and the idea of removing it wouldn't be as controversial, at least for anyone who's not far-right. \n\nBut trans issues aren't treated the same way, instead trans people are expected to shut up and take it and never complain about hateful rhetoric against them. I think part of that is that the trans rights movement is relatively new and many people are still coming to terms with having to accept this group that just a few years ago were living in the dark due to the sheer amount of hate and stigma. Like, you couldn't really be openly trans in the year 2007, you'd get assaulted or murdered and even many LGB people viewed you as a mentally ill degenerate. So yeah, no wonder trans people are furious. They're arguably the most violently persecuted minority right now.\n\nHonestly, this incident was really the nail in the coffin that killed the idea that \"cancel culture\" is even a real thing.

They are all over the dating app, as a bisexual woman, I think half of the women I matched on dating apps are unicorn hunters. Their behavior is disgusting. I really wish I can spread this message \"your man is gross, both of your behavior of tricking other women is gross, he's not attractive at all, stop trying to push your man onto other woman\" to knock some sense into these women's head and maybe leave her gross partners.\n\nI met another Redditor today and she said unicorn hunters once tricked her into their home from a bar \"as a present for her man\", she ran away. So this type of couple is actually pretty dangerous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother example is the comment section of Cuomo's sexual harassment in New York Times. A lot of women are like \"I think his behavior is fine, I even find Cuomo hot\". It's a disgusting attempt to delegitimize Cuomo's accusor's complaints. They seem to not be able to comprehend other women might find Cuomo as disgusting as Trump.\n\nHow do you deal with women like that? I feel their internalized misogyny hinders social progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollow-up question:  I have a speculation, do these women genuinely think their partners are hot shit and then get shocked when other women don't? And they somehow take offense when other women think otherwise and don't want to accept the truth. This attitude seems especially prominent in the defenders of Andrew Cuomo. Why would they try to shut down Cuomo's accusers by claiming they themselves would date Cuomo?

Among many ethical aspects that I want to be informed on is whether the business that I'm about to buy from is known for misogynistic business practices or if it's known for supporting women's right. If given the choice, I would totally boycott the former and support the latter.\n\nHowever, I noticed that I'm currently not empowered to make that choice for myself simply because I do not have access to the information that I need to quickly and easily make an informed decision. Because of this I expect my buying decisions as a whole to be heavily skewed in favor of misogynistic businesses and against the businesses that support women's right.\n\nOf course, I can spend a lot of time to read, collect and organize the information about the businesses that I have the option to buy or not buy from but in practice I do not have that time on hand and certainly do not have the mental capacity to remember everything. The burden is just to heavy to be able bear realistically. Frankly, it seems like a burden that would be more appropriate for a computer.\n\nIt is this realization that led me to wonder \"*what if such an application existed and would be accessible from my phone?*\" When I'd be near a store, I could open the app, it would show a map and the businesses near me with and indicator for each one. A bad score could be displayed in red and a good one in green for instance. After leaving the store you'd get the option to rate the store and that's be quick and easy.\n\nThe data would be crowd-sourced. People who use the application would be the ones to give the ratings. With time, the database would grow and become more and more complete and powerful.\n\nI'm a software developer. Technically, I know that developing such a system is absolutely possible. It's even possible to put defenses into place to block the people who would try to manipulate the data (ex.: a coordinated group of bigots mass upvoting bad businesses and mass downvoting the good ones). Search engines, for instance, have such algorithms. Not every voter would have a vote that weights the same in the balance and there would be advanced algorithms to rate how much a voter is trustworthy and therefore how much their votes should weight in the balance.\n\nWhat I'm not sure about is whether people would actually use this application if it existed. If it was well-designed, quick and easy to use and worked really well, would you use it and would you recommend others to use it? Would you spend some of your time, if not a tiny amount of your time, to rate at least some businesses (including your employers for instance)? Would you like to have in the palm of your hand the power to make that decision for yourself?","title":"If there was an app that would help you boycott misogynistic businesses, would you use it?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/14nva2u\/if_there_was_an_app_that_would_help_you_boycott\/"}

People who have been trafficked do not have a choice in their line of work and it is extremely difficult if not impossible for them to leave their \"jobs\". They are modern day slaves. Survival sex workers do sex work because of economic pressures. They are usually undocumented immigrants, addicted to drugs, homeless, or otherwise severely economically impacted. Voluntary sex workers choose to do sex work of their own volition. They tend to have a higher average education level and are able to safely leave their jobs at any time. They are able to set their own boundaries and screen their clients. Some survival sex workers are able to set boundaries and screen clients, but that is not as universal as it is for voluntary sex workers. \n\nSex work can include prostitutes, strippers, cam performers, porn stars, go go dancers, burlesque dancers, and even bartending depending on local laws, the experiences of the worker, and context of the conversation. Sex adjacent work can include working in a sex shop, working in a swinger or BDSM club, making clothing of a certain persuasion, making sex or kink furniture, and more. All of these things face different levels of censorship and regulation, but each faces at least some.\n\nKnowing that not all sex work is the same and not all sex workers have the same set of experiences is crucial to having a useful debate on the subject.\n\nEdit: if you'd like to learn more about sex work in America, check out the podcast \"Sold in America\".

A colleague of mine told me this was a special group of people, I might have to start spending time here.\\]\n\nHey, everybody! I'm new to reddit. I was told you'd be just the group to help me with my problem. I'll summarize my problem up here at the top to save time, though I'd prefer if those who offer advice read my full story. Basically, my daughter has fallen in with some pretty extreme feminists on TikTok and message boards, and she has begun to act hateful and unkind towards all of the men. While I think men deserve scrutiny, I don't see how her behavior could benefit anyone. I also think it's making her miserable. Do any of you have children that have gone down one of these internet rabbit holes? How do I both affirm most of her values while also dissuading her from this furious zealotry?\n\nWhen my daughter (age 21) started echoing the radical feminists she'd begun reading in her coursework at college, I swelled with pride as her mother. I want my children to live unencumbered by all the bullshit I had to grow up with in the 80's and 90's - the creeps, the getting passed over for promotions, the suffocating expectations to be quiet, polite, servile, ignorable. She's a very intelligent and capable young woman, I never want to see her potential denied. I didn't expect this to lead to any problems, but it has.\n\nIf growing up in a Christian fundamentalist household in the Reagan era left me with any convictions at all, it is this: highly moral(istic) people are also the cruelest. Once they become convinced they are the arbiters of what is right and wrong, they start to see only right and wrong, and begin sorting those in the wrong into demographics. They develop all sorts of petty stereotypes and generalizations, and soon there's no spectrum and no individuals, there are only those on the righteous path and the damned. Granted, we all do this to some extent, but in this group it becomes a monomania. What's worse, as this goes to its furthest point, there is no redemption, forgiveness, greyscale or compromise for the enemy, only punishment. I saw this first when my mother disowned her sister for being a lesbian - she was convinced not only that her sister\/my aunt would burn in hell, but that she deserved it.\n\nI worry my daughter might be capable of a similar fanaticism. She's been out of school since COVID first struck in March and living in my home. I'll regularly take her along on errands, and if in the course of those trips we interact with a man at all (especially a white man), she will spend the entire car ride home inveighing against him. Last week we went to the hardware store and I asked one of the men working there some questions about different varnishes. He gave me a broad overview, explained different brands and techniques for staining and sealing a deck, as well as some referrals for some professionals I could hire. While there was some info in there I already knew, it was exactly the answer that I wanted. The entire reason I went to the store instead of ordering online was to seek out some answers, and this man had been a contractor for 25 years before taking this job as a kind of half-retirement. To my daughter, he was boorishly mansplaining and wasting our time, pathetically trying to show how important he is. She actually called him pretentious! Because he exhibited some expertise about varnish! Yesterday we walked to a neighborhood restaurant to get some curbside pick up. My daughter was blocking the door, looking at her phone, when an older man with a southern accent walked up to her and said, \"Excuse me, darlin'.\" He then stepped around her and walked into the restaurant. It was a two second interaction. My daughter was so incensed she made a TikTok about it. This man did not touch her, he barely looked at her, she is convinced she was sexually harassed.\n\nToday in the car a song by Radiohead came on the radio and I turned it up. Before long my daughter was yelling at me about how Radiohead is \"male manipulator music\" and all their fans are incels and all their music is misogynistic, and she refused to listen to anything that \"endangers women, especially POC.\" For some reason, this was the battle I picked with her this week. I was in grad school when Radiohead's OK Computer album came out, and EVERYONE was listening to it. They're one of the most beloved and popular rock bands of the last 30 years, I don't know how you could draw any conclusions about who they appeal to, as they have millions of fans across the world. More personally, those songs are special to me, they were so comfortingly miserable and pretty and came at a time when I was at my most unhappy, it was like a plush leather couch I could wallow on at the end of a stressful day. \"A heart that's full up like a landfill, a job that slowly kills you, bruises that won't heal.\" That's how I felt! Also, Radiohead are old lefties like the Clash. They've never issued any kind of statement that could be interpreted as dangerous to women. When I asked her to back up some of these assertions, she said I was gaslighting her (this is more or less her line whenever anyone questions her about anything.) She pulled up some TikTok videos of teenage girls saying listening to Radiohead is a major red flag, and you should never date someone who likes their music, but there was never a rationale, and many of these girls seemed to be joking (I don't get it? These are pretty serious accusations, I don't understand why trying to slander and ruin the career of an artist that has done nothing wrong is so funny?) All my daughter could come up with was the song Creep, which she sees as this grand thesis of toxic masculinity. The booming guitars in the chorus symbolize male rage, and the singer's desire to lash out at his beloved. I tried explaining that it was the early 90's, the grunge era, and all songs had quiet verses and loud choruses, but she wasn't having it. I see Creep as a pretty run of the mill song about unrequited love. There was definitely a night in college where I related to it so much I cried, but I was probably just drunk and tired.\n\nHer father died in 2019. He was a good father and husband, and they were very close. His job as an oncologist meant he wasn't around much in the first five or six years of her life, but after some marriage counseling he made a continuous effort to be as present for her as he could. She attended what was once an all girls' Catholic college in St. Paul, MN (there are now many non-binary afab and trans men there, too, but anyone amab is prohibited from attending.) She's been in therapy for about five years now and both of the psychiatrists she's visited diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder. (She does not accept the validity of that disorder). She has never been sexually assaulted, and has never dated nor been in any way physically intimate with anyone.\n\nI've tried my best to let my children find their own path, and have never wanted to force a belief system onto them the way it was done to me. That said, I hate the way she treats people now, as if they've years of work to do to even be considered salvageable while she is some perfect, blameless being of pure light that's victimized at every turn. The idea that a straight white man could be of any value or have anything meaningful to contribute to her life is laughable to her, and she sees them all only as grotesques worthy of contempt. She's clearly very depressed and angry, and I think white men have become the stand in for all that's wrong in her life. I have no idea how she could work anywhere if she remains this confrontational and abusive to men.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is only tangentially about feminism. I think she's gotten locked into an extremist cell. From how she talks about the other feminists she interacts with online, it's like the last days of Stalin, there are excommunications and erasures of the suddenly disloyal every week, and always the looming threat of being cancelled for more minute and arcane transgressions (someone on one of her message boards wrote a poem that used prison as a metaphor for her eating disorder, and was blocked from the group, as this was seen to trivialize the plight of those wrongfully caught in our prison industrial complex?) Reminds me of Bible Camp circa 1988.\n\nHave you had child go this far extreme? How'd you bring them back?","title":"Gen Z Feminism Vs.

Most of it was classic right-wing xenophobia (i.e., immigrants from the Global South are all misogynistic rapists that shouldn\u2019t be allowed in our country), and then there was stuff that was just downright white supremacy. For example, I saw things like calls for genocide against African nations or claims that India needed to get re-colonized by Europe. It was absolutely horrible.

In fact, if anything I've seen a lot of evidence that women are *sexist against women.* From my research the data seems to support that premise.

Methotrexate is a cancer treatment which can also be used in lower doses to treat certain autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis (diseases which primarily effect women btw). Methotrexate is an abortifacient and can be prescribed to induce an abortion, and so in some states, pharmacies are refusing to fill womens\u2019 prescriptions. [time link](https:\/\/time.com\/6194179\/abortion-restrictions-methotrexate-cancer-arthritis) I want to be clear that these women are not pregnant, and are not using this medication for abortions. In fact, some of the women being denied prescriptions are incapable of getting pregnant (because they are post menopausal or because they have had a hysterectomy), not that it should ultimately matter. \n\nThis is certainly not the only drug that will be restricted, any drug that has a side effect of causing miscarriage may become inaccessible to women of childbearing age (and older) in certain states.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but reading about this has particularly enraged me, I think because my sister takes this medication, so I can see the improvements it\u2019s made to her well-being.

They did a bunch of them.  They set up a self defense scenario, homeowner shoots burglar, and laid out the circumstances so it's a \"barely legal\" shooting - under a strict interpretation of the law it's a lawful self defense shooting but a lot of people might disagree (burglar verbally threatens death but doesn't have a gun).\n\nWe could debate that but bear with me here, that's not the point.\n\nThe study concentrated on gender bias and gun bias.  I assume y'all don't care about gun bias - in brief, if the gun used by the defender is \"scary\" the legal outcome for the defender is worse, by a big amount.  The two main guns looked at are the \"Mini 14\" (looks a bit like grandpa's hunting rifle) and the AR-15 \"assault rifle\".  The two guns have the same type of semi-auto trigger, shoot the same bullets, similar magazine size, etc.\n\nOk, that's just background.\n\nWhat's fucked with my head is the gender bias.  First problem: women were judged more harshly than men, BOTH in terms of likelihood of conviction and length of sentence handed down by jurors.  Second: the bias was even worse if the defending lady dared to use the scary black plastic rifle instead of the pretty wood furniture one.  Sad but not that shocking.  Third, and to me worst of all, **it was the female jurors who were the harshest against female defenders.**\n\nWhat.\n\nThe.\n\nActual.\n\nFuck?\n\nOk, here's a link to a ten minute summary of the issue by a criminal defense attorney who handles gun defense cases:\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=GlIamnGDA-M\n\nThis is part two, part one focused on the gun type, I'm assuming y'all don't care so much so the quick summary I did will be all you need to dive into this part.\n\nHere's the actual study if you want to dive deeper:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.thejuryexpert.com\/2009\/09\/will-it-hurt-me-in-court-weapons-issues-and-the-fears-of-the-legally-armed-citizen\/\n\nOk.  With my head seriously messed up as to why, because *women are statistically way less dangerous than guys*, I turned to my wife for help.\n\nI met my wife in 2012 when I was hired as her bodyguard and research assistant on an election monitoring project for some Obama supporters.  She was the lead attorney.  A month into it she said \"hey Jim, we could have fun on this trip or we could have REAL fun!\"\n\nWe got married in late 2013.  I took her last name, no regrets even though I'm a dude with a \"maiden name\".  Used to be March, now Simpson.  She was a trial lawyer for 25 years in seriously rednecky rural northern Alabama and ye Gods does she have stories.  More on her if you're curious:\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=W5SU2i48_m4\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=PG-jAg5Z_Vk\n\nAccording to her, every criminal defense attorney knows about this gender bias problem.  She says James Reeves (the lawyer in the summary video) had to be lying about being surprised by this, or he's way incompetent.\n\nShe says it's not just gun cases.  It's drug cases, DUI, everything to do with violence cases, on and on.  The criminal justice system works as well as it does only because most cases are pretty clear cut and anybody with a pulse can figure it out.  Plus there's 12, not just one juror.\n\nShe said her method of dealing with it was to spend more time in jury selection than in the trial, *know* the jury, and tune all of her arguments to appeal to what she thinks is the top three jurors on her side.  She would rather have a hung jury than lose completely, first because a lot of prosecutors won't try again and second, she can take advantage of any screwups made by the prosecution to get the judge to block a retrial.\n\nShe said the fundamental issue is a tendency on the part of lady jurors to be judgemental.  It comes from their having to be the primary parent and they get used to being judgemental on the kids.  That becomes ingrained.  OR...\"patriarchal thought is getting ingrained on the victims\"?\n\nI'm still...honestly, horrified.  And shopping for a mini 14...\n\nI ask...DAFUQ?\n\nBecause I think this is seriously important...","title":"Why would lady jurors judge female defendants more harshly than they judge guys under the same circumstances?

They are just painted as undesirable losers not that we have a societal problem. Here is an exchange from a podcast with an economist with a guest.  As you know, disabled individuals in the Netherlands often receive a sex voucher to transact with sex workers. Is this a good idea or a bad idea? They\u2019re a kind of incel, not the way the word is usually used, but they are, at least in some cases, involuntarily celibate. And this is how she responds \n\nWell, no\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m just going to answer the question. Do I think it\u2019s a good idea or a bad idea? I think it\u2019s a really difficult idea. I think we have to start with the perspective of sex workers. Why is it that most women engage in sex work? Well, most women who engage in sex work typically do it because they need the money. They can\u2019t get better forms of work, often because of their status as trans women or a lack of documentation or a disability. The rates of women with disabilities are really high in sex work.\nWhen you take a population of women who are doing sex work because of those reasons, and then you create a voucher system of the kind you\u2019re describing, I think you\u2019re in problematic territory. Which isn\u2019t to say\u200aRadical sex workers like Juno Mac and Molly Smith, who are the authors of Revolting Prostitutes, are very uninterested in answering the question of should we, in an ideal or even in the real world, have sex workers being subsidized by the state to have sex with disabled people, because they think it\u2019s a massive distraction from the reality of sex work for the vast majority of sex workers, which is true. Let me just say, you were asking\u200a\u2014\u200awhen we\u2019re thinking about this policy question\u200a\u2014\u200awhy should we bring in a whole, completely orthogonal ideological question? It\u2019s like, no, that\u2019s what it is to do politics. What it is to do politics, and also to do policymaking, is to think about the real-world consequences of policies that you put into place.\nSo, what I want to know\u200a\u2014\u200aand I don\u2019t know enough about\u200a\u2014\u200ais, what are the effects on the actual women who engage in sex work in the Netherlands? How much do they get paid for this? Are they happy to be doing this? To what extent are they subjected to sexual violence because of this? How does this change and inflect their labor rights? That is the question.\nThis is not an orthogonal ideological issue. I think I will just get off at the very start, when you\u2019re just thinking sex is this basic need for men. I think that, if we\u2019re talking about pernicious ideology, that is very much a piece of a pernicious patriarchal ideology that thinks that, for men, sex is this basic good. It\u2019s like food or water. The women who refuse to have sex with men are depriving them of a basic necessity. Women are both that necessity and the gatekeepers of it.\nPart of the reason this is such bullshit is that, if you look at the incels who spend all of their time ranting in precisely these terms online\u200a\u2014\u200athey are not interested, on the whole, in having sex with sex workers. And you know who else they aren\u2019t interested in having sex with? They\u2019re not interested in having sex with nonwhite women, with women who are not stereotypically attractive\u200a\u2014\u200awomen who are fat, women who are shy, women who are on the autistic spectrum, women who are socially awkward.\nWhy? Because they claim that what they\u2019re upset about is the deprivation of this basic need, which is sex, but what they\u2019re actually upset about is their perceived low status in that sexual hierarchy, a hierarchy that rewards men who supposedly have or who get to have sex or are attractive to high-status women. So yes, I do think that you cannot have these conversations about sex work and how to legislate it without centrally engaging with questions about patriarchy.\n\n\nSo I\u2019m just curious why the gratification of men is even in modern society talked more about the people in conditions of human trafficking, dire poverty, etc. and what can we do to change that.

Mental issues is seen as a woman's problem.

Which is why when girls\/women express themselves, cry or get angry they're often told to \"take your medication\".  And there are popular insults that often get said like \"Bitches be crazy.\"\n\nSo mental health is for weak, inferior, crazy women and to access the same help, would be to admit that as a man you're inferior and feminine.

It was a user arguing for others to change their mind about female privilege. Their argument was that female privilege was ultimately the result of the patriarchy. The most common reasoning for the OP's argument was that because men were mainly in charge of the world and how society went down, and any and all advantages towards women in the system mainly stems from men's condescending attitudes towards women. This went for the concept of murder. Women are less likely than men to be sent to jail even if they each committed the same crime, but OP's reasoning was that it was because men are used to viewing women as less capable and more \"stupid\" for the mere fact that they're women, thus letting them off the hook way more than other men.\n\nHowever, the comments insisted that the patriarchy isn't really to blame for the advantages women may possess in society, and the reasoning being that women also play a major role in how society goes down, and are \"thusly\" also responsible for how women are treated (in the USA). For example, while many women receive the honor of gaining child custody, the commenters argued that the reason for this is because they felt that it was pointless to call female privilege \"undercover misogyny\" since women are, well, benefitting from it. The comment section believed that misogyny was only present when women are being attacked or having their rights restricted, rather than being \"blessed\".\n\nHonestly, I disagree with the comments on this one. Yes, women have been, and still are privileged in some aspects of society to this day. However, when you look at privilege, you have to go beyond the actions and actually look at *intent* in order to understand the big picture of what's going on. Let's say that someone holds the door open for you all the time, offer you half of their lunch, and always asks to help you on your assignments. On the outside, you seem to be pretty pampered right? You have all these nice things going for you, and you feel better off than others who don't have access to such help. However, let's imagine that person is actually helping you because they believe you're literally too weak to open doors for yourself, too irresponsible to make your own lunch correctly, and too stupid to finish your own assignment without help...doesn't feel so wholesome now, does it?\n\nIsn't that basically the case with the way many women (USA) lived back in the day? They weren't encouraged to get an education outside of high school, nor were they encouraged to get a job to support themselves. Instead, women were, and (depending on the country) still are encouraged to rely on a man through the method of marriage. But when you actually pay attention to what many people across the world believe about women due to traditional values, you'll realize that the reason why many people, especially men, choose to pamper women isn't because they genuinely worship them. The reason why many people choose to pamper women and would much prefer them not playing a huge role in many societies is actually because it's commonly believed that women are literally too stupid and weak for anything major (anything outside of raising kids and doing basic ass chores). In this case, you can say that women are privileged in the sense that many people discourage them from working so hard, but not because people *look up to them* as it's really the opposite.\n\nI see it very similar to how minorities, especially black men, were segregated in the military during WWII. Many minorities were put in basic duties such as cooking, cleaning, and grave-digging. These tasks were very lighthearted compared to combat duty, but anyone with half a brain should know better than to think minorities were segregated into the easier tasks \"because they were loved\". Quite the opposite, actually. Minorities were segregated into relatively lackluster duties because the (vast majority) USA looked down on them. Many to most USA citizens believed that minorities were stupider and weaker than the luxurious, ferocious, handsomely strong and talented white male (\/s). The USA believed that minorities could only be as great as shit like dish washing, floor scrubbing, and grave digging when it came to war work. \"Privileged\", but ***deeply insulting.***\n\nSo back to the main question now that I've expressed my thoughts: Why are people so quick to overlook the depth of female privilege? Why do people, especially men, choose to ignore that many pamper women in the sense that they think women are too weak for anything major? How could people believe that it's complimentary for the world to think you're too stupid to be taken seriously, and discouraging you from being recognized as an equal? Also, if I got anything wrong in my perception of history, please let me know!","title":"Why do many people believe that \"female privilege\" is an act of worship rather than condescension?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/owwe8n\/why_do_many_people_believe_that_female_privilege\/"}

In fact, a while ago somebody asked about anti-feminist terrorism and if women are afraid, and I wrote this horrible thing: \n\n>One variable I need to highlight is internalized misogyny. There are women who actually can generalize about men and feel wary about them, but... I can't. \n\n>I think men who talk about feminists \"hating men\" just... Don't realize how hard it actually is sometimes. I, personally, can name 100 men I admire with an order of magnitude more ease than I can name 100 women I admire. \n\n>It doesn't matter that it was male teachers and male students who have harassed or dismissed me, it doesn't matter that a woman has never grabbed me as hard as a man had, or made me feel as endangered as multiple men have. Because 95% of all of the inventors, scientists, politicians, writers, painters, musicians, athletes, doctor, lawyers, etc that I have ever heard of are men. And I seek out women. I read Rejected Princesses and I read a lot of bioethics (the area of philosophy with the most women I have ever seen that isn't \"feminist philosophy\").\n\n>I can't hate men, no matter how many shitty things they do to me or to people like me, simply because I do not have a single story of men. I know too much about too many awesome men to be able to make any judgement about the entire cohort.\n\n>And men... Aren't in that position. Men can just have a single story of women. \"They're all whores\/ prudes\/ conniving\/ idiotic\". Men can generalize about women in a way that I find it cognitively impossible to generalize about men, because Hypatia and \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet and Marie Curie and Lise Meitner and Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper and Elizabeth Blackburn and Donna Strickland and Barbara McClintock and Mary Somerville and Emmy Noether all just kind of... Don't actually matter to people and are not front and center in the education system. \n\n>The history of who women were and what women did that children are taught is... A combination of \"nothing\", \"rape victims\" and \"somebody else's wife\/daughter\/mother\". And that fucked me up in a much greater way than the terrorists. Because when you meet an MRA, and you have a lot of internalized misogyny, and you were raised with a school system that named maybe two important women in the history of humanity... It feels like you can't argue back. It feels like you might actually just be a worthless dick-hole for someone else, for the real people, who are all men, because you can't count as a real person if you are a woman...\n\n>And maybe they say women haven't been important to science, which is the only way to measure importance, apparently, and then you say \"well what about Lise Meitner?\" And they respond with \"Lise who?\" And then they assume that the fact that they don't know means that she must not have been very important. They declare themselves the arbiters of knowledge, and that knowledge is derived from sexist history books about sexist times during which women were systematically disadvantaged and somehow still managed to make important discoveries and lead rebellions and fight and travel. And then they say \"the fact that these books completely dismiss women's achievements is proof that women didn't really achieve all that much, because the books aren't sexist and it's all in your head and stop being such a feminazi.\"\n\nAnd I just... \n\nMaybe it's the TERFs and the edgelords getting to me. Maybe it's that being autistic often comes with depersonalization and also with gender variance. I don't know. \n\nBut I keep being in these spaces where I'm expected to self-define and don't know how, and I keep feeling like the ENTIRETY of my experience of \"womanhood\" is... Suffering. And there's nothing *positive* about it. Everything people tell me is supposedly positive about womanhood makes me feel worse. \n\nI keep thinking that this is just patriarchy. And like, if I lived in a matriarchy I would want to be a woman. But if I lived in a matriarchy being a woman would be a non-defined thing, in my eyes, because the dominant group gets to pass itself off as neutral. \n\nSo... Do I want to be a woman in a non-sexist space, or do I want to be neutral and seek out whatever place is *coded* that way? Or do i want to be a man, but am scared to transition because beauty standards have brainwashed me into thinking anything that might \"tarnish\" my feminine body is irresponsible because my first duty is to men who might stare at me in the street?\n\nI spend a lot of time in trans spaces and every time I talk to a trans woman it feels like I am talking to an alien from a different dimension. My ability to understand them is broken specifically because everything they say just sounds like a rationalization for a strange form of masochism with extra steps. \n\nAnd... I don't think I would have that reaction if I was actually a woman. I think this is a weird reaction to have, given how so many cis women seem to understand them. When trans women say \"well, imagine you woke up in the body of a man and you were stuck like that\", cis women seem to respond with \"oh no!\", and not with \"awesome, I get to have full access to personhood instead of being delegated to weird nonsense and my very body is no longer a political battleground!!\". \n\nI also think this reaction of not-understanding-trans-women reminds me a lot of what *they* say about *men*. I've seen trans women talk about how they basically understood \"being a man\" as a series of nonsense stereotypes and that transitioning *freed* them from gender stereotypes, unlike the general TERF hypothesis of trans women being particularly performative in their femininity. And the way *they* understand \"being a man\" seems to be very close to how *I* understand \"being a woman\". \n\nIt's just a list of shit people say I should do that I don't like and I don't want and I don't understand why other people are so *fucking insistent.*\n\nBut I also feel like I am somehow \"running away\" from being a woman. Because it's \"too hard\". And it *is* so. Fucking. Hard. So *tiring*. So *overwhelming* and so full of balancing acts! And I hate it! \n\nBut being trans is hard too and I think I would also hate that. *Which lines up with what trans people say* a lot. \"I don't want to be trans, I just want to be cis but the other way around\". \n\nI guess what I want is not really an \"answer\" to my situation so much as a *methodology* to use to think through the question of separating internalized misogyny from social dysphoria so that I can work on my internalized misogyny and see if it alleviates the dysphoria or not. Because I just feel very stuck right now.","title":"How do you know if your dysphoria is actually internalized misogyny? And does that change anything?

I feel like being gay is more taboo than being a lesbian (i'm not saying lesbians have it easy), and I tend to strongly link that with a specific kind of sexism: \"women's objetification as a sense of inferiority\".\n\nI mean, sexist people (from both sexes) tend to be confortable treating women as sexual objects, and they perceive sexualization as a weakness. When a sexist person see men being sexualized (ex: portrayed as highly attractive, ellegant or even homoerotic) then they mock that. They tend to assume feminity is linked to attractiveness (then they expect women to groom themselves a lot), and masculinity with a lack of beautiful traits. \n\nI think sexist people tend to feel bad about gays, mostly because they hate seeing a man appreciating the appeal of another man. In fact, sexist people also hate when a woman is heterosexual in an active way, they hate when a woman is open about her desire on men, they consider sexually active women (in hetero ways) to be sluts. Exactly the opposite when the woman is desired: lesbianism is highly erotized (up to ridiculous levels) by men, while straight males are encouraged to engage in sex with multiple women.\n\nSystem of a sexist mindset:\n\n-men desiring women: they are free to do It and it's better if they are 100% open about It, promiscuous too.\n\n-women desiring men: they are sluts.\n\n-women desiring other women: that's hot in the eyes of a man because women must be hot.\n\n-men desiring other men: shameful, men can't be desired, and if a man likes another man he is putting a man on a woman's position (which is emasculating).\n\nI used to believe homophobia and sexism are not linked, but i'm changing my mind.

To me, feminism is about women having the right to choose what they do and how they live their lives, whether that be being a doctor or lawyer, or being a nurse, or being a stay at home mum. I also believe that men should also have that same equality, and if a man wants to do a traditionally female role it shouldn\u2019t be looked down upon, likewise if a man chooses to be a stay at home dad. I believe that we should all have the right to choose and also have the right to.. not be looked down upon. However, whilst \u2018girl bosses\u2019 (I hate that term) are celebrated in today\u2019s society, I feel that traditional \u2018female roles\u2019 are still looked down upon. \n\nI work as a personal assistant, which in society is a stereotypically female job. Firstly, I think a lot of people don\u2019t actually understand what the job entails (it is not just making tea and booking flights) and secondly, I do feel a bit looked down on at times. I have been told by a friend that they think I could do \u2018better\u2019 than just being an assistant, they didn\u2019t mean anything offensive by saying that, but I think this is something a lot of people think. In my old office, I was asked what my sister did for work and I said she was a doctor and someone commented \u2018ah she\u2019s got a real grown up job\u2019 .. which I found pretty offensive.. and then on social media, I see a lot of Tik toks and things of women who are in I guess stereotypically \u2018male\u2019 jobs, and they say things like \u2018I\u2019m not just someone\u2019s assistant\u2019 etc etc. I think it\u2019s amazing that women are able to do these jobs and are thriving in them, but I don\u2019t understand why we belittle the stereotypical \u2018female\u2019 jobs, still in 2021. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?","title":"Do you think that stereotypically female jobs are still looked down on?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/mbaqzm\/do_you_think_that_stereotypically_female_jobs_are\/"}

In our career, we identified many women who are incredible leaders and who have leadership styles that are nothing like men's. They are definitely strong, they will not let anyone put them down and they really inspire us. However, our department is about 90% women, including students, and we are very supportive of each other.\n\nOn the other hand, in local politics and public\/corporate settings, where women are subject to constant discredit and violence unlike our very privileged academic department, we've seen that many women in leadership roles are boxed into roles of submission or reproduction of patriarchy. We identified this:\n\n(1) Some women we know in local politics have to act all \"quiet and nice\", they are always forced to shut up when they actually start opposing males around them (even those who are supposed to be equal or inferior to them in hierarchy), and they have to make themselves look smaller than they really are. We have friends in local politics like this and it's just gut-wrenching to see friends who are 10 times more capable than the men around them have to play themselves down so they won't feel \"menacing\" to men. To get leadership they seem to have to convince men that they are not a \"threat\" (to patriarchy, obviously). \n\n(2) But we've also seen some women who power forward \"acting like\" men leaders and reproducing some of the same violent\/patriarchal tactics. For example we talked about a friend's boss who would shame men and women under her by saying they were like \"little girls\". We felt like some of the women we talked about would impose themselves by \"being more of a man than the men around them\" and this just felt... a bit sad? One of my friends said something that stuck with me, she said: \"leading like that just reinforces the notion that the only way to lead is to adopt male traits\".\n\nNow, the women leaders in my department are _very_ \"strong\" leaders, but they simply do not do the things we've seen sexist men do in positions of power: they never abuse others, they never make people feel lesser, they never use their position to intimidate people. They nurture those around them but they are also fierce \"af\" when they need to. It just _feels_ much different than, for example, hearing stories about my friend's boss. \n\nBut we also realize its easier for these women in our department to lead like that because they are respected by everyone here. The women in the public sphere we talked about seemed to be forced to chose between being \"innocent little girls\" or \"one of the boys\". We do have many friends who are all \"unapologetic feminists\" and decide to be \"nasty\" (in a good sense), refusing to shut up. They are incredible leaders too, but we can't hide that they lead only women, and work in women-only political groups. Many of them, when in a workplace or academic setting, will do the same and be \"innocent\" or \"one of the boys\" because that strategy gets more food on the table and more success on their careers, even if it's just an act. \n\nI don't know, I think you get the deal. What do you think could be a way of demanding respect and seizing what is a right without having to play those stupid roles?","title":"How can a woman demand respect as a leader without \"playing innocent\" or having to convince men she's \"one of the boys\"?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/ly1ftn\/how_can_a_woman_demand_respect_as_a_leader\/"}

Incels, PUAs, MGTOW and MRAs each have a separate reason for their hatred, but they all share that one common goal, to try and humiliate, dehumanize and terrorize women and girls via harassment to mass murders of women, men and children.  Anti-feminist Anders Breivik murdered 77 women, men and children.  Writing a 1500 page manifesto explaining how feminists and women were responsible for the feminization and Islamization of Europe. Breivik is just one of many men that had ties to terrorist hate groups that committed mass murders due to being radicalized by these groups.\n\nMurder isn't their only tool for terrorizing women, MRAs have been known to do things like desecrate a memorial spot where a woman was raped and murdered in a park.  The MRA spray painted a large penis over her memorial site.  Then you have these men sending death and rape threats to women because they simply said something they didn't like.\n\nI can't imagine that women and girls are unaffected by being the target of hatred, death threats and sexual terrorism by radicalized men.  Yet, I see way more sympathy extended to men that are radicalized than I do the targets of their terrorism.  There has got to be a significant impact on women and girls mental health that are exposed to their ideology or directly confronted by these terrorists.  And then to add insult to injury seeing these terrorists turned into sympathetic figures.  I also wonder how these hate groups effect how women interact with men?  Is it harder to trust men?  Is there a fear that the man you're interacting with may harbor hatred and resentment towards women because it's so prevalent?","title":"Feminists and women in general, are the target of numerous violent terrorist groups.

I've heard about this phenomenon with adult women, who seem to be putting up with men somewhat less than before (but I expect that because even older women seem to decry marriage a lot nowadays), but how early is this \"burnout\" coming? As far as I can tell, girls actually seem to be pulling away from them because of the Andrew Tate-ism, Shapiro, Jordanson etc, which wasn't so much of a thing before? For example, while I think stuff like bra-snapping (popular in the early 2000s?) wasn't really tolerated, but more seen as \"nothing\", girls these days tolerate a lot less from their male classmates. The sexism's maybe more hostile, but the response seems more staunch as well. But idk. \n\nThese are kind of strange times, I guess. We have some TikTok influencers or so extolling tradwife lifestyles, and in the same breath you can find women who talk about how they've basically sworn off of partnering with men (or maybe just living with them) these times, and then you hear statistics about how women aren't dating men as much or how they're participating less in the workforce after COVID, and it's a little hard for me to put all these ducks in a row. But I really do wonder if that Germaine Greer quote is coming around now. \"Women have no idea how much men hate them\", something like that. I feel like nowadays, that's becoming less and less true, since women and especially girls (who've grown up with the internet) can basically see men's private thoughts about them now and wonder if even the ones who are nice to their face believe stuff like that behind closed doors, or would actively protest if the world started shifting to a place where men could just expect domestic servants again. If the same guy who they think of as a friend and seems benign enough would actually do anything more than shrug or give some strongly-worded complaint (then go back to their normal lives) if they were, say, forced out of education or a workplace. For example, it's rare to find a man who stands up for women in male-dominated online spaces. Typically, you'll see at least a couple of women defend men if something is said about them in a female-dominated space, but actually, to date, I've never once seen a man stand up for women in a male-dominated space when they begin to say sexist stuff. So then I wonder if the younger generations who've actually grown up with social media are actively noting these things.

Any use beyond that is the result of social conditioning, sexualization, and commercialism.\n\nIt saddens me that this norm is so deeply ingrained that young girls, some as young as 12 with no physiological need for support, are pressured into wearing them.

It\u2019s a part of natural, male impulse to them. Therein lies both the misandry and misogyny. Throughout their lives, many women have experienced being reduced to sexual objects, having their boundaries ignored, and dealing with unwanted sexual attention - sometimes from people they considered friends. So this, to them, is yet another violation. For many women, finding out a friend has been privately sexualizing them can feel like a betrayal of trust and could make them question the entire friendship.\n\nso in sum, women are objectified constantly, and they feel betrayed and reduced when someone they feel they can trust perpetuates the very harm they\u2019ve been working so hard to escape. some aren\u2019t too keen on considering the ethical implications of how we view and treat those who trust us with their friendship.

Or in this other meeting another mother \"denounced\" how the other \"sluts\" of her daughter's grade were already having sex (they are 16 y\/o). \n\nMostly this type of situation happens with the mothers of my students (mothers are usually the caregivers of my students and the one to go to the school to talk with me, because \"dad's working for proving to the house\" ) , which makes thing twice complicated. I mean,  I feel I have to intervene so how, but those are their daughters, but the violences is there, but I feel I am mansplainning feminist theory to an adult female (the mothers).  So, any advice?

Now, its no secret that India is consistently ranked as one of the worst places to be a woman and is always in the news because some foreign female tourist got harassed, raped or got murdered in India. Amongst the women circle, the general consensus is - Don't go to India, it's a dangerous place and you'll end up in unimaginable situations that could ruin your life in ways that are unfathomable. \n\nAnd don't even discuss about - How Indian men literally stalk foreign women ( aka white women ) on social media platforms and ask for \" Bobs and Vegana \" - whenever they have the chance to speak with a foreign women online. So Indian men in general have a really bad reputation for being extremely horny to a point that they feel comfortable asking any women they met online for their nudes or feet pics or whatever. \n\nNow, as a single 25yo Indian man, I could englighten non - Indian people as to why Indian men behave like this. One of the first reason is societal conservationism - it's no secret that Indian men and to a certain degree even Indian women are sexually repressed because of our conservative society that literally banishes people who have been involved in sexual intercourse before their marriage. Call us whatever you want - but the biggest irony is we're the country of 1.4 billion people - largest population in the world and still talking about sex is seen as a massive taboo and something that people look down on. \n\nSecondly, there is a massive shortage of girls in this country. I've read projections around - 50 - 60 million less girls than boys ( because of sex selective abortions ) - so not every Indian man will get married even if every Indian women is open to marriage. So limited number of girls in this country coupled with our daily chaotic hustle means you got no one to talk to when you come home and all you could do is jerk off. \n\nThirdly, because India is a conservative society - It is a common practice of our parents and teachers to drill this notion inside our minds to stay away from girls and only focus on studies. I remember even though I went to a private co-ed school where both male and female students were in the class, I have strong memories of boys and girls sitting seperately along an aisle - so boys sat on one side and girls on the other side of the aisle. Apart from that, talking with girls about anything would draw the attention of the teacher who would then threaten the boy to stay away from that girl. \n\nFourthly, our pop culture hasn't done a particularly good job of depicting women. From nasty item songs of women doing erotic dances in the middle of a pack of men or the way our movies have depicted white women as supreme and white women are easy going and white women are into Indian men and they're promiscuous to a point that you could have easy sex with them etc etc. Having a white colour skin is seen as something to admire and sexually fetishize on when it comes to India and all credit goes to shitty bollywood movies and songs. \n\nLastly, lack of any sex education, no practical social interaction with girls of your age during school or college or even offices, always being a Mama's boy, promulgating stereotypes about Indian women that they are not supposed to go outside and work and are only meant to be housewives and baby factories, admiration and sexual fetish for white woman to such an extent that people stare at you whenever you're in India which is pretty normal in this country but pretty abnormal and obnoxious in any western country. \n\nThere are even a couple of points that I may have missed out - so anyone in comments who wants to chime in and elaborate on this would be incredibly helpful. \n\nNow, there's nothing I can do about the backwardness or conservative aspect of my country's culture as India is such a big country in terms of population with zillion different sub-cultures and so disseminating my own ideas surrounding women empowerment or gender equality would frankly be considered as - taking a dump on your ancient culture and religion and that would bring me into a lot of trouble. \n\nBut how can I as an individual and India as a country which is a land of different cultures embrace women empowerment and gender equality in all forms. I know that no country is 100% gender equal but there are things that we as Indians could learn from countries and societies and cultures that have achieved high levels of gender equality and women empowerment. \n\nAnyone's feedback would be deeply appreciated on this - I don't know if there are any Indian women on this sub, but if there are - you could understand and offer opinion on this situation based off of your experiences of living in this country.","title":"What can individuals do to promote gender equality and women empowerment in countries with radically conservative cultures?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1edjzfj\/what_can_individuals_do_to_promote_gender\/"}

From what I saw and literally counted there are 3x more women volunteering than men. Men are a rare sign. Why? It would make sense than in case of a war and crisis like that anybody would help regardless of gender. Not overall, nobody needs to volunteer if they don't want to, but why is majority of volunteers women? Surely, \"helping people in need\" cannot be a women thing, it should be a human thing?\n\nEdit: I'd like to add, since it's the argument in the comments, women who volunteer here aren't jobless. They work the same amount of hours as men and yet spend hours volunteering after a job, even nights. They're willing to take a day off if it's needed. \n\n\nThe volunteering I'm talking about is mostly about help with supplies - either buying them, sorting them out, moving them with cars. It would seem to me \"moving heavy boxes\" would qualify as \"men\" job in a society.\n\n\nThe comments about draft make no sense since I'm talking about Ukrainian refugees coming to Poland and Polish people helping them. Polish men aren't drafted to war (yet) in Poland so they have just as much free time as women right now.\n\nEdit 2: I'd try to clarify what I mean by volunteering in this context. First of all, it's not 24h work unless you want to. There are shifts, you can sign up for only 30 minutes, an hour, two. Your choice.\n\nThere are, of course, more men volunteering, for example to drive to the border and take families by car than women (also because women going alone to meet strangers isn't safe) and I'm not saying they're not volunteering at all. Everyone are helping as they can in this situation. Even if you're not helping in any way it's alright, there's no obligation, it's a big mental pressure.\n\n\nWhat I meant is that in volunteering groups that are mainly made for people like me who have no useful skills like knowing Ukrainian, Russian, having a car, a free flat to spare, being a lawyer or a doctor, majority of people helping are women. And we don't do \"women stuff\", we don't take care of babies or cook dinners since there are people assigned to it already, we're not here to take care of refugees or nurtue them, we do mostly physical work and organisation. If we have contact with them, it's because they come to take clothes or food we sorted out. We're not here to be their emotional support, there are people and hotlines for that.\n\n\nMy question was of simple nature, I was interested why the statistics are what they are. I am in no way saying men are \"worst\" for volunteering less, but I am interested in reasons behind it be social, psychological or gender roles.","title":"Why do less men volunteer to help than women?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/texzym\/why_do_less_men_volunteer_to_help_than_women\/"}

I've seen it permeating non-MRA spaces such as MensLib as well and have been thinking about my perspective on it for a while.\n\nThe central line of reasoning that underlies this thesis seems to be \"men have typically served in the military and women haven't, therefore men have historically been and continue to be considered disposable.\" But from my perspective as someone who has studied history professionally, this doesn't check out.\n\nMilitary service has traditionally come with a host of associated privileges, including things like grants of property and labor, in various historical contexts. In more recent times, American military veterans have been able to attain financial mobility via the G.I. Bill and are largely celebrated for their service. There are also historic military groups like Janissaries who were certainly not considered disposable, but considered essential for maintaining the empire they served and despite being officially enslaved, received privileges and benefits for their labor. In many historical contexts, soldiers who lost their lives were not at all considered \"disposable,\" but celebrated for their martyrdom to a cause, whether that be the Crusades in Europe or anti-colonial struggles in the modern world.\n\nThese options have often been closed off to women in large part and women have thus been denied benefits that men could acquire through military service. However, we have also seen cases in which women *have* served as active combatants - my primary expertise is third world guerrilla struggles and women played their part in a variety of roles, including the warfare itself. This goes entirely ignored by those who argue the \"male disposability\" thesis.\n\nThe thesis rests on a complete misunderstanding of most warfare. It is not usually in a state or institution's interest to dispose of its own soldiers willy-nilly. Soldiers are not considered disposable, but again, are invaluable for upholding the state's rule in the face of both domestic and external threats. Losing large numbers of combatants in battle is not efficient for military victory and would cause huge issues in terms of maintaining an active force.\n\nFinally, there is the logical error in the line of reasoning. In order to demonstrate that men are considered \"disposable,\" we would need to see evidence of widespread attitudes that match that belief. I don't believe we do and we certainly do not see it in the context of military service - again, wartime combatants are generally celebrated and rewarded for their service. Those who perish in war are not just forgotten and cast aside, but typically lionized for serving a cause. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nEdited to fix a couple of minor typos.","title":"What do you think of this \"male disposability\" claim that's become popular on Reddit?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/mjz86c\/what_do_you_think_of_this_male_disposability\/"}

Apparently he was just generally a creep, making inappropriate sexual jokes, rubbing women\u2019s shoulders, not respecting the women he worked with, etc etc. Good riddance. \n\nWhat was ESPECIALLY concerning to me is that during the discussion about this guy who was recently fired, one of my coworkers said that apparently for awhile now, HR has had to warn people to not let this man be in the same room with a woman alone\u2026 umm\u2026 WHAT.\n\nThis was deeply unsettling for me to hear and I got angry. I commented about how it\u2019s sad and ridiculous that before this man was fired, the whole company was basically working around his creepiness and went good lengths to just make sure that no woman was ever alone with him\u2026 since apparently he was incapable of handling himself.\n\nBy the way I should mention I was having this discussion with all male coworkers. I actually considered them to be fairly progressive, but now I\u2019m not so sure. I was expecting my coworkers at the very least to agree with me, but they just started defending the guy!!\n\nFirst coworker said:\n\u201cWell they couldn\u2019t just fire him. He was in an extremely lucrative position and wasn\u2019t easily replaceable so HR wanted him around for awhile. Also, I\u2019m actually surprised that someone so high up would commit such acts\u2026 usually that\u2019s not the case\u201d.\n\nSecond coworker went on a very weird rant and I think I must have triggered him in some way:\n\u201cHR can\u2019t just automatically fire any guy accused of sexual harassment. There is a long process to go through. Also, that guy was notably an asshole and weirdo to most people. The problem is that the behaviors that men are ok with receiving, women consider sexual harassment. Also, what even is considered sexual harassment? Are jokes considered sexual harassment? Men joke with each other all the time, but women often have a problem with those same jokes so men need to filter themselves around them.\u201d\n\nIn short, my second coworker was implying that this guy was generally a creep but that men \u201csuck it up\u201d and women complain and yell harassment the moment they feel any discomfort. I tried to explain to him that it\u2019s VERY likely that this man was treating women very differently and more inappropriately than the men he worked with, but my coworker just kept saying \u201cehhhh maybe, maybe not\u201d as if it was too much to consider that women often get treated differently in the workplace. He simply would not budge.\n\nThey did end the conversation saying that they agree with what the guy did was wrong and he deserved to be fired, but that I can\u2019t just expect HR to immediately handle these things. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how I triggered them SO MUCH when all I complained about was the fact that HR had to warn women not to be in the room alone with this man. I mean that\u2019s just insane. Thank god he\u2019s fired now, but that alone is ridiculous.\n\nThis conversation made me even more upset than before. I am especially hurt because I actually liked and admired these coworkers of mine, but this conversation just made me feel incredibly alone and like some of their true colors were shown. It\u2019s hard enough being the only woman on my team currently, I\u2019m half their age, and I work in a male dominated field. I\u2019m tired of the excuses that men make for creeps.","title":"Why do men always casually defend men who have been accused of sexual harassment?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/vfd7i7\/why_do_men_always_casually_defend_men_who_have\/"}

As the jury booth started to fill up, and it appeared to be mostly men in the booth, the prosecutor and defence started using their challenges to eliminate men (any age), allowing women to fill the rest of the jury.\n\nIn the end, the jury I was on had 6 men (all ages including me) and 6 women (thirties and older, definitely no teens or twenties). \n\nDuring the court case breaks, I chatted with the bailiff who escorted the jury around the courthouse. The bailiff explained to me that in my jurisdiction, the legal profession has an unspoken understanding with one another, that all rape \/ sexual assault court cases should be heard by a jury of 6 men + 6 women but no young women. \n\nI assume the train of thought is young women won't approach the trial objectively and will tend to be biased towards the victim, who is typically also a young woman. But I don't know, just guessing.\n\nDown the track when it was all over (it ended with a hung jury if you want to know) I reflected on how I felt about this situation.\n\nOne school of thought is that the prosecutor + defence have a certain number of jury challenges that they can use, and they can use them however they like. They can even coordinate with each other, it's all perfectly legal, so who cares?\n\nOn the other hand - juries are supposed to be a sample of the community where the crime was committed, so that the community can pass judgement on the defendant. If a particular subset of the community is being deliberately excluded from the jury, then the jury is no longer reflective of the community. So is the jury's verdict, intended to be representative of the community, really valid - in a deep philosophical sense, not a legalistic-rules sort of sense?\n\nIf the lawyers started eliminating everyone that had dark skin from juries, there would be a massive uproar...\n\nNow that the context is established, my question for r\/askFeminists is: should young women be excluded from rape\/sexual assault case juries, as is the situation in my jurisdiction?","title":"Juries for sexual assault cases - no young women in them","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/hwxeh2\/juries_for_sexual_assault_cases_no_young_women_in\/"}

I still love them deeply, but I can\u2019t ignore how their choices in men are straining our relationships.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: these aren\u2019t situations where someone is blindsided or trapped in a carefully hidden cycle of abuse. These are men who show, almost immediately, exactly who they are\u2014often outright abusive\u2014and yet, my friends still choose to engage. They see the red flags, practically feel the breeze from them waving, and proceed anyway.\n\nI\u2019ve been unpacking my feelings about this in therapy because I know judgment isn\u2019t helpful. But it\u2019s hard to sit back and watch incredibly smart, capable, emotionally mature women\u2014women with high self-esteem, fulfilling careers, and great lives\u2014knowingly walk into relationships with people who are so clearly harmful. It\u2019s not just frustrating; it\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\nI understand there\u2019s a wider context here\u2014society conditions women to value being chosen over their own well-being. But it\u2019s exhausting to watch that play out in real time. I don\u2019t want to victim blame, and I know the responsibility for abusive behaviour always lies with the abuser. But at the same time, I can\u2019t help but feel like some of these women are making a conscious choice to ignore the danger signs because they prioritise the idea of being in a relationship above their own safety or happiness.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve always been someone who prioritises self-preservation. I\u2019ve had to make tough calls in the past to walk away from situations that weren\u2019t good for me, even when I wanted love. And that makes it really difficult to reconcile how my friends\u2014who I respect and admire\u2014can make such different choices.\n\nThe hardest part is that I can feel my respect slipping for some of them. I hate admitting that, but it\u2019s true. If I had a daughter, I wouldn\u2019t want her looking at these friendships as examples of how to navigate relationships.\n\nAnd yes, I know the wider problem isn\u2019t their fault\u2014it\u2019s deeply ingrained in how women are socialised. But knowing that doesn\u2019t make it easier to watch people I care about willingly put themselves in harm\u2019s way. These aren\u2019t cases of manipulation or deception. These are decisions made despite everything being painfully clear from the start.\n\nI\u2019m not a pick-me, and nearly all my closest friendships are with women. I believe fiercely in supporting other women\u2014but I\u2019m also really struggling with how to stay connected when it feels like we\u2019re so fundamentally misaligned on something so important.\n\nI know I need to keep working through this, because these are people I love. But honestly? It\u2019s been hard to keep showing up without feeling disheartened.\n\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m also really curious about the change I\u2019ve seen particularly as we got closer to 30, a lot of the women I\u2019m referring to had normal relationships up until this point or would be more likely to leave a man when he was clearly awful, the changes I\u2019ve seen coincide with the conversations that started in the late 20s of wanting to settle down\/ have kids\/ not lose their chance.","title":"How do I get over the judgment I feel towards other women who make decisions I fundamentally disagree with?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1i288nn\/how_do_i_get_over_the_judgment_i_feel_towards\/"}

When her family asks him about what Koreans think about Americans he talks about how his country thinks about greasy food and being fat. It was probably staged a bit and meant to be silly, but some of the reddit comments gave me this strange feeling. This video has been around a lot of subs like Funny and the Intersting AF one. I first saw it on a post titled \"They were not ready for that\" on the Unexpected sub. This family wasn't even that big for American standards, like most of them just had a gut (which I thought was normal for some older adults) and the girl didn't look plus sized to me. However, some of (not all) the comments were acting like he \"owned them\" by telling them the truth, and were regarding the people in the video as if they were disgusting gigantic slobs who deserved to get a metaphorical smack in the face because the scene portrayed them as being a little upset about what the boyfriend said.\n\nI was a teen when the celebrations of different body types had just started, and I consume media with positive representations of plus-size characters, so I was just kind of upset seeing some people talk in such a condescending way. Some people in the comments said that in Korea \"piggy\" is like a cute way of saying \"cupcake\" and isn't meant to fat-shame in a brutal way, and that when they pinch your belly it's a playful gesture that you should lose weight; but it's something not meant to be super serious in Korea (according to some of the comments). But some people in the comments of these posts were taking this silly scene of a culture-clash and a Korean guy teasing her about being \"chubby\" and seemed to be doubling-down on all fat people. He may not have known how hurtful his words sounded and that's fine because he grew up learning different standards of how people should look, but it was the comments calling his actions \"chad behavior\" that bugged me. Why aren't plus-size people or those with visible guts allowed to be content with being \"fat\", why can't they feel their bodies are beautiful in their own way and have to be pressured into changing?\n\nI'm not denying that the American system is horrible for our bodies as we're fed processed food constantly, and we have barely much time to workout due to work hours and other activities; but I felt that a lot of the comments weren't being fully considerate of the fact that everyone has a different body type or different genetics that make them naturally bigger than others. Some people can be born with slower metabolism or have conditions, like Lizzo, which make it harder for them to lose weight. I thought that most people were more tolerant of thicker bodies, but now I'm just confused based on some stuff I've seen. I can't show the specific comments I saw that I disagreed with, so I'll have to quote them down below in the comment section. When I was watching the video I felt bad for this girl, especially cause I watched some more clips from this episode and she wanted him to stop calling her that, but he wouldn't. But some people didn't seem to care about her feelings 'cause she was chubby. I also felt like the comments were invalidating the existence of plus-size non-Americans because of their mentioning how the other countries think this about us, and are used to \"telling the truth\" about someone's looks and don't have high obesity rates like us; but that still doesn't make the harmful opinions towards fat people okay.","title":"Why does peoples acceptance of fat people seem to fluctuate?

What can individuals, communities, and society at large do to promote shared emotional support among all genders?\n\nThanks in advance","title":"Why do some men expect emotional labor to be a woman's job?

I can honestly say that the anti-feminist and misogynistic crowd has one, and only one argument that is \"effective\" at mass recruiting men in to their sphere: The narrative that \"feminism makes women independent, so they don't need men anymore\", or in other words \"Women are genetically wired to only want the top 20% men, so if women are economically and sexually liberated thanks to feminism, they will join Chad harems instead of going for their equals.\" \n\nIt's sad and tragic that this argument is so effective, as it's just a form of male sexual entitlement, apart from being plain wrong. And it's unfair and annoying to ask feminists to push back against this, unfair because feminists aren't to blame for male sexual entitlement and annoying because it's the same thing over again (male sexual entitlement was probably the number 1 reason for misogyny throughout history). But I think that, unfortunately, feminists have good reasons to do something against these narratives getting stronger, because:\n\n**1. Many statistics used are just plain wrong**. So in that case arguing against it is not like \"admitting\" that women have a \"duty\" to give men sex and are \"fulfilling this duty\", it's just correcting false statements. \n\n**2. They are the most effective arguments used to recruit men to misogynistic ideologies**. \"You will live a lonely, sexless, depressed, miserable life because of feminism making women free, so let's get rid of feminism\" seems to work on a tragically high number of men, more than anything else.\n\nSo I think it would be good to actually push back against these narratives. Examples could be:\n\n* **It's not true that male sexlessness rates are rising all the time and are much higher than female sexlessness**. The General Social Survey (GSS) from 2022 shows that the number of 18-29 year-old men not having sex that year [was 12%](https:\/\/ifstudies.org\/ifs-admin\/resources\/figure3-56-w640.png) (compared to 11% of 18-29 year-old women). The GSS report of 2018 made headlines because it showed [28%](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/4C7SSBIXSNFCLOJIGCWUOKDYTY.png&w=916) of 18-29 year-old men not having sex last year (compared to 18% of 18-29 year-old women in that year), but this was an outlier, and not in every year men had higher sexlessness rates (the 2018 number the highest number measured for men over the years, and by the way still lower than the highest number measured for women, which was 30% in 2021). Other surveys from different sources show [different numbers](https:\/\/ifstudies.org\/ifs-admin\/resources\/2-comparison-graph-w640.png) than the GSS - they don't show an increase of male sexlessness in the 2010s like the GSS.\n* **It's not true that male singlessness rates are rising all the time and are much higher than female singleness rates**. A Pew report that [showed](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/short-reads\/2023\/02\/08\/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans\/) that 63% of young men, but only 34% of young women are single made headlines (just like the GSS numbers from 2018). But there are multiple other surveys that show smaller gaps among 18-29 year-old men and women, mostly 10-20% (disfavoring young men). So it's true that young men are more likely to be single, but the numbers given by the Pew report are far too high, and finally: The major reason for the gap is that there are more relationships where the man is older than the woman, than vice verse. For example, the GSS from 2022 showed a singleness gap of 9% between 18-29 year-old men and women, that got reduced to [2% between 18-29 year-old women and 20-31 year old-men](https:\/\/twitter.com\/nuance_enjoyer\/status\/1662694515235491841).\n* **It's also not true to say \"Women want to earn the same as men, but still marry a man who earns more!\"** In the U.S., already [1\/3 of wives](https:\/\/nypost.com\/2021\/02\/04\/only-30-percent-of-us-wives-earn-more-than-their-husbands-data\/) out-earn their husbands. The only reason why the numbers aren't higher is probably because women still earn less than men on average, so it's more likely for a man to earn more than a woman in a random setup. And marriages in which women earn more are [not more likely](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5021537\/) to end in divorce (not that being unmarried or divorced is inherently bad, this is just to show that the narratives about \"women are only interested in money\" is wrong).\n* **Lastly, women are not exclusively dating tall, muscular, rich men**. The number of sexual partners for men [doesn't correlate](https:\/\/blogs.chapman.edu\/crean\/2015\/09\/29\/new-research-analyzes-height-weight-income-and-more-in-regards-to-sex-and-dating\/) with much with height or weight (5'7 men have about the same number than 6'4 men; overweight and obese men have a slightly higher number than men with normal weight). And men with low educational attainment are actually more likely to [lose their virginity early](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1446372\/), be [more sexually active](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4081028\/) than the average man, and [have more children](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/data\/nhsr\/nhsr179.pdf) than men with high educational attainment (men without high school degree have 1.7 children on average, men with bachelor degree or higher have 1.0 children on average). The reason is probably \"assortative mating\": People date among their own. So attractive men date attractive women, but non-attractive men can still date non-attractive women; the same way rich men date rich women, but poor men can still date poor women (and for some reason, poor people seem to have more and earlier sex than non-poor people). \n\nSo I think all of this could be said in answer to these narratives being pushed in the anti-feminist, misogynistic spaces. I rarely hear people countering the manosphere narratives in feminist spaces, and while I don't think they have a duty, I think it would be good to have a \"debunking\" ready everytime these narratives come up.\n\nOf course, at the end of the day, the solution has to come from men: Male sexual entitlement has to be eradicated. The ideas that \"Men need sex to stay mentally sane, they freak out without sex\" or \"Men don't need emotional connections with other men, so more male friendships are not the solution for lonely men\" have to be eradicated. It shouldn't matter how much sex men have (especially in regards to the question: \"Should women have the right to choose their sexual\/romantic partners and their career paths freely?\"), and lonely men should not only seek out sex with women as the solution for their loneliness. But as it is now, male sexual entitlement is still very well alive among many men, and it's a major recruitment strategy for misogynistic men. Before try to give these men a different outlook for their problems (for example, many suffer from a lack of social connections), it could be a good counter-strategy to actually tell these men that the manosphere narratives are wrong, using real statistics. The men who can be still reached, could gain from this.","title":"It seems like the \"hypergamy-induced male sexlessness\/singlessness\" narrative is getting stronger.

One is how women are involved in more reproductive \/ domestic \/ emotional labor. The other is how women may be pressured \/ forced to become symbols of a group\u2019s identity under patriarchy in ways which men aren\u2019t. The original framing was conflating these and also speaking of culture too vaguely \/ imprecisely.\n\nHere are some examples of what I\u2019m talking about (not necessary to read to answer my question):\n1. In my college Japanese cultures class, my Japanese professor explained that during the Meiji restoration, a lot of traditions changed as they industrialized and forged a new national identity. For example, the working class and men\u2019s clothing changed. But middle class women were pressured to wear kimonos, or at least became associated with it strongly. In the modern era (at least a decade ago), Japanese women often are societally pressured to wear a white toned makeup which is tied to a white Japanese racial identity (not white in a European sense). I\u2019m sure my knowledge of this is oversimplified. The point is that all these cultural symbols are born by women and not men, generally speaking.\n2. I have also heard that in 20th century America, white women were pressured to shave more in order to assert that white women were more feminine than black women and WOC. This both served to force women to submit to patriarchal beauty standards in response to women\u2019s rights movements, but also to be a symbol for the white race \/ white supremacy. \n3. A slightly different example is how some black people report that mixed black people are way more culturally black if their mother is black as opposed to some other race (usually the example given is white). \n\nHere are more questions to qualify my original question in the title:\n1. Is this a real pattern or am I taking anecdotal evidence out of context?\n2. Is this because women take on more domestic and emotional labor under patriarchy, resulting in them becoming more significant in bearing cultural symbols and passing the culture on?\n3. Is this because pushing women to become symbols of culture is another way for men to control how women present themselves \/ control women in general?\n\n","title":"Why is it that women are more involved in passing down culture, maintaining culture, and bearing cultural symbols than men?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1dotugc\/why_is_it_that_women_are_more_involved_in_passing\/"}

A man got on my train and immediately began to sexually harass me. It turned into assault when I tried to move away from him. Being in a moving train car felt like being trapped in a cage with him. It was awful. It felt like an eternity before we reached the next station. I bolted from the train and the station as quickly as possible. Then I stood outside crying until I was calm enough to go back into the station and report the incident.\n\nI knew they would have security camera footage, but even so, I felt unhelpful. The police asked me if I knew what time the incident began. I did not know exactly. They asked for a physical description, but he had been wearing a face mask and I avoided eye contact with him. They asked if I knew what specific train\/train car number I had been on. I didn\u2019t know. They asked if I had taken a picture of him. I had not.\n\nAre most people in these situations really calm, collected and bold enough to gather all of this information while attempting to remain as safe as possible? Am I just really bad at this? I almost didn\u2019t even go back and report it. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it or be involved in a potential legal case, and I didn\u2019t feel like I had enough solid information. I feel like I panicked and failed.

Please read edit no.2 before reading.\n\nThis has been touched on in this sub before, but I was curious what people\u2019s thoughts on the linguistic and cultural phenomena of male-gendered words or habits becoming ungendered? The first example that comes to mind is \u201chey guys\u201d or \u201cdude\u201d. I call my mom dude all the time but (even though I\u2019d be happy to) I can\u2019t imagine how my dad might react if I called him girl. The only example of woman-coded language becoming ungendered that I can think of is \u201cgo piss girl\u201d but this might be limited to my small social circle (I tell EVERYONE to \u201cgo piss girl\u201d regardless of gender, even though some of my guy friends roll their eyes or look confused). I think there\u2019s evidence going back ages of this sort of linguistic phenomenon.\n\nThis is similarly the case with clothing, hobbies, etc.\n\nMen are punished and ostracized for adopting feminine habits to a greater degree than women are for adopting masculine habits because patriarchy generally rewards masculinity*. What are some tools to combat this means of reinforcing the patriarchy? Uninhibited men adopting women\u2019s clothing, hobbies, and habits? Maybe something less superficial? I understand that this is broad and vague and that the answer might just be ditching patriarchy completely but I\u2019m curious as to what people\u2019s personal thoughts and strategies look like.\n\n*maybe an oversimplification but hopefully it gets the point across\n\nEdit: I want to clarify that I am not trying to diminish the barriers and repercussions for women breaking gender roles. Women are subject to so much more violence, ridicule, and are robbed of so much more agency. Enforcing patriarchy on men is still enforcing patriarchy though, and anyone can be complicit and it still has adverse ripple effects for women.\n\nEdit no.2: I really don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I said men are punished for breaking gender roles than women. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, it\u2019s that simple, or reflects the idea that I had in mind I guess. Women certainly have more barriers in competitive environments (i.e., salary, positions of authority, etc.). I think in part because masculinity is treated as the default, as neutral, women can get away with wearing men\u2019s clothing, for example, whereas men will draw more looks (and maybe violence) for wearing skirts and painting their nails. I don\u2019t really know how to articulate this well- if you\u2019d like to help please do.","title":"Thoughts on masculinity becoming ungendered- how to work towards femininity doing the same?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1d7895m\/thoughts_on_masculinity_becoming_ungendered_how\/"}

It is not my intention for it to be either.\n\nI remember a few years ago that many feminists were dissatisfied with men\u2019s reluctance to open up to women about their emotional problems and that they consider the tendency of men to bottle up or repress their emotions as damaging or toxic. As of recently, however, I\u2019ve seen various posts on women-centric subs the complaining that men unreasonably expect women to be responsible for men\u2019s emotions as well their own and that oftentimes, even if women do take responsibility over men\u2019s emotions, they\u2019re then seen as flirting or as seeking a deeper relationship than desired such that they\u2019re in real danger if they decline men\u2019s advances. These posts claim that men have a much lower emotional intelligence than women and that if men were truly aware of the situation or the burden of their own emotions on others, they would either turn to other men or to therapists help them out and simply leave women alone.\n\nI do not wish to invalidate either perspective, but holding them simultaneously does seem to put men in a no-win situation. If they open up to women, men risk overburdening them with their own emotions, but if men do not, then then they become alienated from women in a way that negatively affects both genders. How can men, then, open up to women without unduly burdening them? Is there something I\u2019m misinterpreting? Or is this simply not a problem at all and I\u2019m just making stuff up? If I\u2019m describing an actual problem, is there a simple solution that I am missing?","title":"How can men open up emotionally to women without overburdening them in the process?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/17337cp\/how_can_men_open_up_emotionally_to_women_without\/"}

For example, when I talk about menstruation, sexual violence on the streets or online  harrassment, all of those are things that I know be reading  and listening, but I do not live, so I feel weird suggesting strategies  for facing them or explaining  them what's the root of it.

This has been my approach (as I answered in one comment):\n\n'The main approach  is recognizing situations  that are be violent and understanding  that they are not right. We talk a lot about consent, like  consensual  touching, sexting, or penetrative sexual practices. And strengthening  the communication skills, like saying no, share emotions assertively and freely, being cautious  on the information  they share on internet, etc.\n In some case, in private some students have approach to me to share their situations, and what a I have done (any feedback will be well recieved) is to help them identify the emotions that the situation  generated on them, help the identify if they wanted that to happen and if they want to keep doing it, and being the sandbox to elaborate the speeches or plan towards the situation.  ( idk if I am making myself clear, I am not English native and translating this is difficult) If there is anything illegal or if there is actual risk for somebody's wellbeing , the school have protocols.

Any of these reasons are messed up, but I'm really hoping the majority of men aren't actually enjoying making women uncomfortable?

It's basically what I have been thinking about after a bit of reading, and I wish to hear from different perspectives! Sorry in advance for grammar and other mistakes; I'm slightly intoxicated.\n\n  \nI\u2019ve been reading about strain theory in my sociology classes and was trying to better understand the incel phenomenon, not to excuse the misogyny, but to understand how it forms. After talking to a few of them, I kinda got this idea of a crazing unsatiable desire to have romantic\/sexual relations,  and holds a defeatist and nihilistic attitude regarding their actual or perceived inability to find a partner, even tho many of them are still very young.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about when trying to combine the theory with our reality\n\nPatriarchal culture and tradition tells men their worth is often directly tied to sexual and romantic success, basically, \u201cyou\u2019re only a real man if women want you.\u201d in mass media and pop culture sucessful men are almost always dipicted as either having a stable romantic relationship or possesse control over women either emotinally, physically or materially to a point where they can comfortablly objectify women or forcing the woman to \"willingly\" objectify herself for him due to various reasons.\n\nTherefore, when some men don\u2019t achieve that or think the goals to be impossible (due to appearance, social skills, mental illness, disability, etc.), they experience a kind of existential failure. (This is what i have observed.) I've heard their reactions\/lashout to be described as entitlement, which I largely agree, but also wish to share a slightly different perspective\n\n Strain theory suggests that when cultural expectations can\u2019t be met by legitimate means, people experience social strain and sometimes lash out or form subcultures. It is usually used on a broader societal level with the focus on economic success, but i think success in dating could be another primary cultural expectation. That seems to line up with how incels often form communities around their strong desire for relationship combined with, bitterness towards rejection, and even further, often violent radicalizations.\n\nStrain theory can also provide a structure for the different types of  men when it comes to dating, with the five categories:\n\n1.  **Conformity**\n\n* Accepts both the goal and the means.\n* Example: A regular man who attempts to date and continues to work on himself in mostly conventional ways or uses dating apps in hopes of achieving intimacy. (This can also include the red pills)\n* 2. **Innovation**\n* Accepts the goal but rejects the legitimate means.\n* Example: Incels who adopt \u201cblackpill\u201d ideology and promote manipulation, misogyny, or even harrasment\/SA as ways of coping with rejection and perecived failure. (most incels)\n* 3. **Retreatism**\n* **Rejects both the goal and the means.**\n* This group disengages entirely, neither striving for sexual success nor participating in the social systems that could support it. (people who don't desire a relationship and do not attempt to find one)\n* 4. **Ritualism**\n* **Rejects the goal but accepts the means.**\n* These people don't desire or think it is impossible to acquire genuine sexual\/romantic relationships, but still go through the motions of going on dates. They\u2019re maintaining the *form* of participation, even after abandoning the *meaning* or *goal* behind it (not very familiar with this type)\n* **5. Rebellion**\n* **Rejects both the goal and the means, and seeks to replace them.**\n* These individuals reject society\u2019s existing values and attempt to replace them with new systems or ideologies.\n* Example: More radical incels or men\u2019s rights activists who advocate for regressive societal restructuring, enforced gender roles, patriarchal dominance, or political violence in order to return to a perid when women had no autonomy in sex\n\n  \nYou could interpret the categories differently, and I would love to hear your thoughts on it, maybe I missed out a group of people, maybe starin theory cant be used as a framework to look at the issue at all.\n\n  Incels often accept the dominant cultural goal: achieving romantic and sexual success, which is heavily tied to social ideals of masculinity, self-worth, and adulthood. ( we all know how fragile those things can be) However, they perceive the legitimate means, such as dating, emotional vulnerability, self-improvement, or respectful social interaction, as either inaccessible or ineffective for them.\n\nWhat\u2019s also especially striking to me personally is the growing prevalence of what I think could be called body dysmorphia, especially in younger men, obsessing over height, jawlines, muscles, etc. Obv women has always been more vulnearble to it due to the male gaze and gender role on female appearence, but its also starting to apear in men and espcially those who consider themselves incels more and more, with many of them hating themselves for their physical apearances usually for being not \"maculine\" enough. \n\nA lack of resources to help prevent radicalization, gender norms that are aginist men going to theropy, combined with no organic body positivity movement amoung men, and a more \"normalized\"  views on jokes that involve male body shaming in media esp regarding height, penis size or other biological sexual inaquities(which i dont have an issue with) It seems like lots of men who are simply insecure or sexually inexperienced are being radicalized and funnled towards the incel ideology that end up actually reinforces the patriarchal beauty norms which they themselves alreadt suffer from.\n\nThank you for reading through this!    I would love to hear what women and feminists think about these questions:\n\n  \n**1.** Do you think it\u2019s accurate or productive to frame incels as victims of patriarchy, even though they often reinforce patriarchal values themselves?\n\n**2.** To what extent do you think the rise of incel ideology is driven by the tension between societal pressure on young men to be sexually or romantically successful, and the increasing autonomy and selectiveness of women?\n\n**3.** Could it be helpful or practical\u2014as part of feminist or social movements\u2014to challenge and reduce the cultural expectation that everyone should be in a sexual or romantic relationship, in order to disrupt one of the root causes of incel ideology?\n\n**4.** What can men do to help prevent the spread of misogynistic ideas, particularly those associated with the incel community?\n\n5. How could the goal\/expectation be made less oppressive and universal? Do you think legitimate means could be made more accessible, such as deconstruction of beauty standards, esp for men for this issue, or even legalizing prostitution, making it a more legitimate means to acquire sex ( with that obviously being morally dubious at best) \n\n(I'm fairly new to feminism and theory, so I'm sorry if this is just basic level knowledge, or has already been asked.

The main issue here is that I can't really reconcile two statements that seem at odds for me\n\n1. Upon being asked, women will very often say that they don't dress nicely or put on make-up for men, but for themselves, to feel good, for their female friends etc.\n\n2. Women however as far as I can tell generally also emphasize that female beauty standards are patriarchal expectations set on them and enforced by men\n\nTo me it seems like both of these statements cannot be true at the same time. If women claim to overwhelmingly conform to beauty standard for themselves then it would be stretch to also claim that men are the reason they do it, even if some of their beauty standards were originally created by men\n\nI would appreciate any new perspective on this because I probably haven't considered everything there is to consider here.

And I understand and empathize with how countless negative experiences with men have made women wary of us, but I have had to live knowing that my life would be more dangerous because my presence would always be perceived as threatening from the age of 13, and all of a sudden hearing that it might be partially justified just angers me.  \nWhenever issues like these are brought up, I see statements like \"No, we're just pointing out that you're still men\", failing to realize that **I am not solely seen as a man**. My blackness can not simply be separated from the way you view me as a man.  \nI'm well aware that the lack of attention to how the patriarchy affects black men (and moc in general) is largely due to white feminists and I shouldn't think that this is how all feminists think, but this disregard nonetheless seems to dominate the majority of feminist spaces I've seen on this platform.  \nAgain, I don't intend to insult anyone, and I'm sorry if this looks like nothing more than a mess of words, but I just want to explain some of my grievances and gain some understanding.","title":"Why are the issues of men of color in relation to the patriarchy always invalidated\/disregarded?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/ojgwjy\/why_are_the_issues_of_men_of_color_in_relation_to\/"}

Surely, there are cultures in which there is more equality or where women are seen as higher than men, but from how Lexie was making it sound, at least, that's the exception rather than the rule.\n\nThis makes me wonder if there is some inherent Reality where women are seen as subordinate to men.

Yet, that does not seem to be the case.\n\nAs for the exceptions where there are such cultures, my explanation would be to say that nothing is truly universal, and the existence of exceptions (as long as they are truly exceptions, and not numerous enough that they are no longer really exceptions) does not disprove the rule.\n\nI should also make it clear, how incredibly disturbed I am by this thought process.

I learned that she was in an open relationship, which wasn't something I expected, considering the time period she was alive in. But then I also learned that she involved some of her students, some of whom were apparently underage, in this open relationship. I also learned that she was one of the signatories of a petition that called for the abolishment of the age of consent in France and specifically cited the cases of three men that were convicted of raping young girls. \n\nIt just seems to contradictory to me that someone who seemed to be a champion of feminism would engage in a predatory relationship with her own students, and that she would call for an end to age of consent. To me, it all seems to go directly against what she was calling for in her book.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? How can one reconcile these apparently contradictory actions?","title":"I am struggling with reconciling Simone de Beauvoir's ideas with some actions she took in her private life.

I have no inner conceptualisation of gender. To me, it's always sounded like defining yourself in terms of the patriarchal category you feel fits best. Because I didn't feel any connection to the notion of womanhood, I identified as non-binary for a few years, before realising that of course I didn't identify with womanhood when social notions of womanhood are either nothing like me (I'm not a nurturing, make-up wearing mother) or are simply offensive (e.g. women being seen as stupid, boy-obsessed, vain,). I honestly don't understand how anyone could feel that they are innately any of the oppressive categories that we currently have. So, I am curious as to how someone would describe their gender identity without relying on gender stereotypes\/roles. \n\nPlease help me with this.

I am unable to sleep and am looking for an anonymous soundboard since I don\u2019t know what to else do (and could use advice)... I am an engineer working full-time while working on my dissertation for my PhD. I have loved my work and working for my company for almost four years now, until recently. It has felt like the floor from right underneath my feet has just disappeared and my path to any form of leadership has diminished (in my small office\/company). Recently, I have witnessed a newcomer with only two years of additional experience and far less education come in and be given opportunities to advance to leadership that I was never given. In his first week alone, he was given a training that could have been very helpful for my professional growth, and has even been added onto a professional development team with our executives. However, I wasn\u2019t even considered for the training, nor had I ever heard of such team. I also am routinely required to correct his work and do the things he doesn\u2019t know how to. This hurts even more when I consider all of the late nights and unpaid time I have spent to put our office\u2019s best foot forward, when he gets to work a standard 40 hour week. It has broken my heart in the worst way to watch this happen and I am unsure of what to do now. I had thought before now that since I loved what I did and loved working there, that I could someday advance into leadership. Now, my only path forward has become leaving the company. I am at a loss at this point since I don\u2019t see a future there, but love the work that I do there, which is my passion.\n\n***Thank you all for your responses and advice.

Wouldn't a culture of slut-shaming women make it more difficult for men to get laid? If you shame women into not fucking guys, they're less likely to fuck guys. Do these dudes *not* want to get laid?\n\n2. Wouldn't banning abortion\/contraceptives also lead to these men having less casual sex? Banning abortion\/contraceptives would only lead to casual hookups resulting in unwanted kids these men would have to pay child support to. At that point, most guys would prefer to stick with 1 woman rather than paying child support to 9 different kids. Granted, it's possible that if Evangelicals\/Republicans had their way, men would no longer pay child support. It's also possible they would only ban female contraceptives, but not male contraceptives. If they banned abortion and only female contraceptives, while also allowing men to not pay child support, that would pretty much solidify all the power in a relationship in the hands of the man. I think that's probably where Republicans are going with this. \n\nI understand religious beliefs aren't based on logic or reason: it's purely feels and emotions. Evangelicals don't like premarital sex because they were taught from a young age that it's icky and sinful. It's possible that men raised in that kind of religious environment might sincerely feel it's wrong or immoral to fuck any woman he isn't married to. I guess what baffles me is how religious ideology can be powerful enough to suppress the most basic and universal urge. \n\nBut even when it comes to more secular right-wing dudes, many of them are okay with men sleeping around but not okay with women sleeping around. Don't they realize that slut-shaming women makes it more difficult for men to get laid as well? It takes two to tango. I feel this way especially about rappers who slut-shame women in their songs but praise their own sexual escapades: my dude, wouldn't you get laid more if you *didn't* slut-shame women? \n\nI dunno fam, I'm tired.","title":"Conservatives want to ban abortion\/contraceptives to punish women who engage in casual sex.

Over the past few years there has been a huge upsurge in online feminist content encouraging women to be secure in what they desire in a relationship, being more demanding in what we want romantically\/sexually, and also calling out misogyny and poor behaviour from men in the dating world. I absolutely love this, and greatly support more women being aware of how hetero relationships do not often run in our favour.\n\nNow you can see all this, and yet when a woman expresses desire for a partner\/relationship (completely normal way to feel in this relationship-oriented world), a common retort is 'there's someone out there for everyone' and stuff to that effect. And yet, seeing poor relationships around me in real life and online, all the content mentioned above, I have come to the conclusion that there are simply not enough men who are boyfriend\/marriage material can match up with the number of women who want a relationship\/marriage. Yet why do we constantly try and comfort single women by suggesting that there is?\n\nFor me it seems like a simple numbers game - some women get lucky and find a good guy, and some don't. The definition of a good guy will vary between women of course, but there are commonalities. Social media content of 'meet cutes' and promoting relationships, where you see constant comments: 'I need this one day' 'me and who'.  To me it seems like patriarchal propaganda, and a way to set women up for disappointment - that beautiful love they dream of will never come, because there are simply not enough men willing to fulfil it with us.\n\nAs someone who has entered my 30s moving on from this mindset that everyone will find love eventually, after a huge amount of discomfort figuring it out, to me it seems like a (mild, somewhat unimportant in the scheme of things) feminist idea to encourage women to move away from this constant 'waiting' for a good hetero relationship that isn't statistically likely to happen, to the extent that they don't live their lives to the fullest. What do you think, and what can we do to be more honest and truthful for other women who are in that painful cycle of romantic longing set up by patriarchy, that may never be satisfied?","title":"Is 'there's someone out there for everyone' a patriarchal fallacy that we should stop promoting to heterosexual women?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/1h468af\/is_theres_someone_out_there_for_everyone_a\/"}

This reduces to 79.8% for male children aged 14 and under, and to 49.4% for male children aged 16 and under. Only 19.4% of refuges are able to accommodate male children aged 17 or over.\u201d\n\nThis means that if someone is a 15 year old male, 50% of shelters will not accept them, which increases to 80% for 17 year old males.\n\nIt also means that if a mother is escaping from domestic violence and brings her 15 year old male child with her, 50% of the shelters will accept her but turn away her child. Because many mothers will want to protect their children, this effectively turns mothers away as well.\n\nMany boys are sent into foster care or become homeless as a result of this treatment.\n\nOne reason shelters may reject male children is that older boys \"look too much like a man\" which may scare other refuge residents. Others cite the minimum age to be convicted of statutory rape as a reason to turn away teenage boys. That is, if a boy has reached a high enough age, then the probability that they will be a rapist is considered too high to accept them into shelters.\n\nAre these reasons good enough to turn away male children from shelters? Should we try to change the way these shelters approach child victims?\n\nSecondly, if 80% of shelters will turn away a child who is 17 years or older, then what does this imply about the resources available to adult men who may need help?\n\n---\n\nYou can read the Women's Aid report here: [https:\/\/www.womensaid.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Nowhere-to-Turn-for-Children-and-Young-People.pdf](https:\/\/www.womensaid.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Nowhere-to-Turn-for-Children-and-Young-People.pdf)\n\nHere is a journal article that discusses the reasons why male children are turned away.

Please keep that in mind when responding to other commenters.\n\nI know it's tempting and easy to just dunk on people who are here to troll, here in bad faith, who are parroting obviously wrong things; and I know it's frustrating to hear the same points over and over, but resorting to personal insults isn't the answer-- it's just not in the spirit of this sub's goals.\n\nAs always, please use the report button!","title":"A Reminder About the Rules","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/ug5kyr\/a_reminder_about_the_rules\/"}
