Without skipping a beat she says \"the only anti-aging skincare you need is sunscreen and staying away from men who give you stress\"\n\nYES, Queen. \n\nMy friend's mom is divorced. I've seen pictures of her when she was married vs. pictures of her now and she has glowed up one thousand percent. Her ex husband on the other hand became some washed-up bald guy who can't even dress himself properly and who harasses young women on dating websites.\n\nWhen men say stuff like \"you need to settle down and secure a man when you are young and pretty or else no man will want you\" is a complete lie. If anything, it's the *men* who should be rushing to settle down and secure a woman while he is still young and handsome and has a full head of hair.\n\nI see a lot of women saying they feel old at 25 and feeling like they need to rush into a relationship before they \"expire\". No sis, if you are concerned about aging, literally the WORST thing you could do is settle for a low value man. High value man or nothing. Low\/negative value men will only stress you out and age you even faster.\n\nPSA also, don't forget to wear your sunscreen! Not only does it protect from visual aging, but also protects you from skin cancer, which (aside from a man) is yet another thing that'll put you in the grave faster.","title":"My friend's mom just told me, \"the only anti-aging skincare you need is sunscreen and staying away from men who give you stress\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/nqskmu\/my_friends_mom_just_told_me_the_only_antiaging\/"}

It was the kind of place that had paper as a table cloth so you could write all over it and they gave you crayons. \n\nI\u2019d met a man on OLD, and he asked me to this place. Having arrived early I sat at the bar and ordered a soda with lime (no alcohol) \n\nMy date arrived just on time, on the dot.  I recognized him from his photos. I watched him get seated by the waiter, and so I paid my tab at the bar and walked over to the table with my drink in hand \n\nAs I\u2019m walking he realizes who I am. He is smiling. As I reach the table he says, \u201cNow *there\u2019s* a body that would make my ex wife cry.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack in that uncomfortable, awkward comment. And I didn\u2019t feel like it! Or like seeing him ever again. I said nothing, turned on my heel, placed my soda at the bar, and simply left \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb I blocked him as I walked out, laughing as I did so. Then went to the pool hall across the road \ud83d\ude02 \n\nUntil I found FDS I thought I was a giant asshole for not \u201cexplaining\u201d to this person brand new to me, why his comment was problematic. I thought I was the asshole for \u201cpromising\u201d a date with this man and ditching him without a word. \n\nBut despite the \u201casshole\u201d feelings, I felt completely high on life and giddy that I just slipped away immediately. It was such a huge relief\n\nMuch love FDS ladies! \u2b50\ufe0f Always trending upward \u2764\ufe0f","title":"That time I walked out on a date after his first sentence","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/skfq5r\/that_time_i_walked_out_on_a_date_after_his_first\/"}

This whole time I was working my ass off, I could see him lounging around from the window where I was doing dishes, and in that moment, I fully realized how easy men have it. For a man, there is no choosing between a family and a career because he can have it all.

She is a nurse and has been our tenant for the past 5 years and we have never had any problems until about a year and a half ago when she met a man 25years older than her who is now living with her. He is a leech. He doesn't have good credit, so he is unable to rent on his own, and he doesn't have money to purchase his own property. He doesn't even have a job. This dude has a kid from another woman who he never goes to see. Recently, she gave birth to his twins, and has stopped paying rent for the past 2 months (his excuse is that the electricity bill in the house is \"too high\"). He has bled her finances dry, and she had to get a new job in a nursing home because he raised hell at her old job and she was let go.\n\nWe have never asked for a price increase for her housing since she moved in back in 2015, and recently, my mom asked for a $75 increase in rent\/month to cover for the rising property taxes, inflation, and flood insurance (we live by a coast). The guy has threatened to trash our property because of this \"unfair\" price increase. Keep in mind that they have not been paying rent for the past 2 months. My mom doesn't want to evict her because it would be permanently on her record, and she is young, but we no longer want to renew her upcoming lease because of how much of a headache this trash dude is.\n\nA LVM will quite literally ruin your entire life. Your job, your credit, your housing situation. Unfortunately, our tenant doesn't see it yet.

I've been trying to follow FDS to the letter since I discovered it last summer. I definitely continue to make (and learn from) my mistakes, though. Today I had a video chat date with a guy I should have vetted more thoroughly. Our short conversation was incredibly awkward and he sounded very stilted, like he was reciting lines he had memorized. I at first attributed this to social anxiety and tried to overlook it. However, when I asked him about his work, he gave a short summary and then said, \"I bet that went right over your head.\" Ladies, I hung up on him in the same second, then blocked and deleted. I didn't waste an additional second of my time on his condescending ass. I spent like 3 minutes talking to him in total. I am so sick of men talking to me like I'm a child. I told my (borderline pickme) friend about the date, and she reacted like I had been unkind.

My first day was today and it went great! I am so happy and excited, I was practically skipping home just now, I feel like I am walking on clouds.\n\nI thought I would share, just in case there are any other sex workers out there thinking of leaving the industry: NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO GET ANOTHER JOB!\n\nSeriously, employers are desperate for people right now. Things moved a lot faster than I expected. They didn't even ask me about the gap on my resume. All the things I was worried about in my last post ended up not materializing at all.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not \"easy\" in that I'm definitely going to be working more total hours than before, and it takes a lot of mental energy to break your old habits and way of life. Also, my current job isn't exactly my \"dream job\" but at least it is related to what I want to do in the future, and makes good use of my degree (social work).\n\nBut right now, as in literally RIGHT NOW, is not a bad time to leave sex work because there are so many other jobs available. \n\nThank you so much to everyone for all the supportive comments and DMs I got from my last post! (except for a handful of messages from men who were asking me uncomfortable personal questions... you're sick)\n\nThe funny thing is that 2 seconds after I submitted that post I guess I was autobanned somehow, I felt a little hurt so I sent a message to a mod asking why, then put my phone down. When I checked Reddit a few hours later my post had over a thousand upvotes and a hundred comments, all very supportive! I was not expecting that at all, and actually I was feeling a little anxious about posting my story because I thought I would be judged. \n\nI hope other women like me give FDS a chance. These past few weeks lurking here makes me feel 100 times more empowered than I felt as an escort\/camgirl. All these people going around saying \"FDS hates sex workers\" are actually doing a massive disservice to SW because it's turning us away from this awesome, supportive, uplifting community. I wish I had actually checked out FDS sooner, it would have saved me from a lot of unpleasant experiences.\n\nLastly, I just wanted to say that while the latest podcast episode was not my favorite, and I am looking forward to the response episode, I am still very grateful for the ladies behind the podcast, it literally saved my life. Thank you, mods!","title":"UPDATE: I got a job! (From: \"I'm an escort and camgirl.

Both fuckin' times. These ruthless ladies ended up divorcing his ass as soon as they got permanent residency, all while taking a chunk of his money while they're at it.\n\nYou'd think he would learn his lesson the first time but NOPE he had to go and do it TWICE. Idiot. \n\nAnyways, I know that my dad is a piece of shit so I genuinely have mad respect for these ladies for fleecing him.\n\nI admire the sheer power reversal these women were able to pull off. On one side you have a schlubby-looking middle aged white guy thinking he's getting a \"submissive\" and \"traditional\" much younger wife. On the other side you've got an impoverished woman from a developing country who barely speaks the language and has no support network yet both times these women managed to come out on top.\n\nThat is some QUEEN SHIT right there.\n\nI'd like to share some of the lessons I've learned from these women by observing their relationship dynamics over the years.\n\n#1. Don't argue with men\/narcissists. Withhold privileges instead.\n\nThese women succeeded where my mom failed. My mom would always try to argue and reason with my dad which is pointless when you're dealing with a narcissist, because no matter what you say, they're just going to try and blameshift, gaslight, and DARVO you.\n\nInstead, my dad's 2nd and 3rd wives would just go cold anytime my dad did something that pissed them off. Turn their body away, not look at him, pretend not to hear what he says. Refuse sex. Refuse to cook or clean. Don't react when he tries to provoke her, just act bored and yawn when he speaks. If he gets demanding and agitated, they would do as he asked but in a bare minimum way, almost bordering on malicious compliance. For example if he was complaining about dinner not being ready when he got home from work, how he pays all the bills bla bla bla, they would go to the kitchen, heat up a can of ravioli in the microwave and serve it to him silently, as if DARING him to complain about it. \n\nThis tactic alone had him wrapped around her finger by the end of their relationship. Narcissists don't have empathy so they don't care about hurting you because it hurts *you,* they'll only avoid hurting you if it means not hurting themselves. The only thing that will keep them acting right is fearing loss of privileges. What narcissists want the most is *attention*, it's like a drug to them. These ladies would flatter him when he did what they wanted, and ice him out when he displeased them. These women had so much control over his narcissistic supply that by the end of their relationship he was on a permanent emotional leash.\n\nOf course, the best thing to do when you identify that someone is a narcissist, is to leave. Threat of punishment is not sustainable in a relationship, because the moment you lose the power to enforce consequences for bad behavior, you're screwed. This brings me to my next point:\n\n#2. Do NOT have a baby with a shitty man, or you will be tied to him forever\n\nThis was the one that surprised me the most. Neither of these marriages produced a child. The manosphere is very invested in promoting this idea that all women just want to baby trap men so that we can \"divorce rape\" them via child support.\n\nFirst of all: dear men, nobody wants your worthless sperm. Don't flatter yourself. \n\nSecond, depending on which country you're from (and how good your lawyer is) you don't need to have a baby with a man to \"divorce rape\" him.\n\nThird, the whole baby-trapping trope is pure projection. It's MEN, not women, who try to get women pregnant so that they can control us. Pregnant women are extremely vulnerable, which means they are no longer in a powerful enough position to enforce consequences for bad behavior. \n\nWhen you have children with a narcissist, he does not see them as children, he sees them as hostages. Pregnant women and mothers are often very hesitant to leave an abusive spouse because they fear what might happen to their children. Many survivors of abuse report that the abuse didn't really get started until after she got pregnant or gave birth, because men know that it's much harder for the woman to leave once children are involved. Often, she will not leave until an extremely high threshold of abuse is crossed. Men know this and if he is an abuser at heart he will treat you as badly as he can get away with.\n\nLastly, even if you do succeed in leaving your abuser, if you have children with him you are tied to him forever. Abusers will often demand full or partial custody of children even if they don't want it, just to fuck with his ex. Women are understandably terrified at the thought of losing their kids, or they are terrified what might happen to their kids if left alone with the abuser. Abusive men will often harass you via the legal system *for years* even if they have no case, just to waste your time and money. They can demand visitation then not show up, or demand to pay less child support or even demand to *be paid* child support even if he does jack shit (that's what happened to [Kelly Clarkson](https:\/\/people.com\/music\/kelly-clarkson-divorce-brandon-blackstock-seeking-436k-support-month\/))\n\nAvoid getting pregnant by a shitty man AT ALL COSTS. As a woman, you have nothing to gain and everything to lose. \n\n#3. Be financially independent. If you aren't, and you find yourself in an abusive relationship, take the time you need to execute your plan correctly and for maximum personal benefit.\n\nThe was by far the smartest thing that these women did while married to my dad.\n\nThey did not have the privilege of following the usual \"just leave him\" advice. There was always the threat of deportation, which would have made their situation worse.\n\nEven though they didn't need to work and my dad happily let them stay at home and be housewives, these ladies were disciplined and strategic making sure they got their bag.\n\nThey took courses at the local community college during the day while my dad was at work. Language courses, vocational courses, financial literacy courses etc. to set themselves up for success. During this time they also made friends and built themselves a support network outside of their marriage. They couldn't legally work but they still managed to set aside money by working under the table or selling stuff on etsy.\n\nThey set aside that money until their permanent residency papers came through and they were finally ready to hire a good lawyer and serve my dad the divorce papers. Both times, he never saw it coming. \n\nSince neither were working at the time and had no income (at least on paper), my dad was legally obligated to provide spousal support. They used that money to get their own place, far away from where my dad lives, and according to facebook they are both working jobs that they love and are in relationships with men their own age who they actually like. In other words, they've massively leveled up \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI hate my dad so it was extremely satisfying to watch him get what he deserved, *twice*. I don't even care if it means my inheritance getting flushed down the drain, it was worth every penny watching these women execute such a complete power reversal. I, too, hope to one day own a man with as much finesse as these ladies. In conclusion: don't argue with narcissists, withhold privileges instead. Don't have a baby with them, and take the time you need to level up, build your finances and support network, get your bag then get out.\n\nEdit: laughing so hard at all the triggered redpillers in my inbox \ud83d\ude02","title":"3 lessons I learned from my dad's two mail-order brides.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/ldgnbu\/3_lessons_i_learned_from_my_dads_two_mailorder\/"}

We seemed to have a lot in common in the values we shared, our lifestyle, career (I also work with finance). \n\nIn the beginning, I told him I\u2019m looking for a ltr with emotional connection and won\u2019t engage in casual sex until I\u2019m comfortable with someone and feel committed to them. He said he\u2019s looking for the same (in which I don\u2019t give much thoughts into it because obviously we shouldn\u2019t believe whatever the man says in the beginning). \n\nHe took me on nice dates at fancy restaurants and expressed how much he loved taking me to high-end places because I\u2019m a classy woman. He gave me a small gift on date #4, which I reluctantly accepted. He asked me questions about my life, remembered every little details about me, and told me that he could see us being in a relationship when the time comes. \n\nHe knew how to play his words. He was sweet when we were together but never love bombed (make promises about the future, claiming any strong feelings for me). He was polite, steady and classy. He was going above and beyond to meet my needs, not just the bare minimum.\n\nHowever, during date #5, he asked if he could have a getaway weekend on Valentine\u2019s Day with me in a city an hour away, I firmly told him it\u2019s too soon for me to spend the night with him and suggested we could do another location nearby but I would love to spend a whole day with him (I always try to keep previous dates not too long to avoid moving too fast). \n\nI SWEAR I could see his facial expressions change in the very moment when I rejected him. When we were in the car together, he told me to \u201clet him know if I wanted to go on another date but he is \u2018okay\u2019 for now.\u201d I was confused. I told him \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you meant\u201d. He then shocked me by saying this he thinks we\u2019re not compatible. He doesn\u2019t think he could wait that long for sex and that he wanted someone (his words) \u201cto find him irresistible and would always be excited to have sex with him anytime.\u201d \n\nThis man was the same one that told me how he wanted a woman with dignity and doesn\u2019t rush into casual sex and that sex is not important to him when getting to know someone. I never believed him fully and today, he just proved my skepticism right by switching up on his words.\n\nLadies, I used to be a pickme in the past. I\u2019m 22 and finding FDS was such a life-changing experience for me. It introduced me to my two favorite books \u201cWhy Men Love Bitches\u201d (Sherry Argos) and \u201cThe Power of the Pussy\u201d (Kara King). I learned through FDS and these authors to respect myself, enforce my boundaries, have standards, and most importantly, NOT BE USED FOR SEX. I\u2019m no longer having sex out of fear to keep a man\u2019s interest (which 100% will still diminish even after I have sex with him). I held my foot down and told him \u201cI understand. I won\u2019t change my mind\u201d.\n\nI knew this is nothing personal and would likely happen A LOT when I refuse a man sex. Even though I was shocked and somewhat upset since I had started slowly opening to him and being comfortable around him, I knew exactly what to do. Remember, a strong woman can feel sad and upset, she can have feelings for the moron that did her wrong, there is no shame in that. It\u2019s your emotions, and you can\u2019t help but feel the way you feel. What you can do is NOT ACT OUT ON YOUR EMOTIONS. And I will demonstrate for you this method below.\n\nHere comes the fun part of this story, I enforced a tactic I learned from FDS, gray rocking. On the ride home, I treated this man with SHEER indifference, which is SILENCE. According to Kara King (The power of the pussy), you don\u2019t have to react to your emotions, a smart woman maintains self-control and does not give the man the opportunity to take advantage of my vulnerability. He doesn\u2019t get to think he has any effect on my emotions.\n\nI simply didn\u2019t react. I didn\u2019t make eye contact. Didn\u2019t pout. Didn\u2019t have any facial expression. Didn\u2019t respond to his question, his invitation to \u201ccommunicate\u201d. I applied FDS lesson, I refused to let a manipulative person to engage with me. He is simply inconsequential.\n\nBut I did have to hear him. He was DESPERATELY trying to get ONE word out of me. He used all the tactics, at first, he acted arrogant and continued to say how incompatible we are and how it is so unfair for me to \u201cput up a wall\u201d and being \u201cso hard to read.\u201d But after getting hit with my silence, he began to trip over his words, and tried to apologize for wasting my time.\n\nExamples:\n\n**At first:**\n**Yeah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re compatible. That\u2019s just not me. I want someone who would crave me sexually and you can\u2019t do that. Hahaha you know what I mean. I\u2019m a guy, it\u2019s my biology. I have to have sex!**\n\n**What do you think? Can you tell me what you think? Hello? Did I hurt your feelings that bad? I\u2019m trying to communicate with you.**\n\n**Then:**\n**I apologize for wasting your time. You know it\u2019s soooo hard for me to do this because you\u2019re so beautiful, smart, and funny. You\u2019re sooo close to being my dream woman. But I\u2019m sorry.** \n\n**Hello? Can we still be friends? We\u2019re just people at the end of the day. Sorry, you must hate me right now hahaha. I\u2019m the worst. Nobody is perfect. Can you talk to me? Do you want to still hold my hands? Why can\u2019t you look at me?**\n\n**After continued silence (20 minutes into the car ride):**\n**Damn I can\u2019t believe this is how we ended. I just wish you would talk to me. You\u2019re shutting me down. I don\u2019t understand! Please talk to me!**\n\n**You don\u2019t want to fix this? I wish we could have gotten through this together.**\n\n**Look I really like you. But I feel like you\u2019re leading me on. I\u2019m taking you on nice dates. I treated you like a princess. You\u2019re just looking for a rich man and I\u2019m not that guy. I feel like I\u2019m being used for my money. I really like you but you gotta give me SOMETHING! I don\u2019t want to be used! Please speak to me. I don\u2019t want to end things like this.**\n\n\n\nI looked at him with disgust and finally spoke to him after 30 minutes of silence, \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that you would pressure me into sex and accused me of \u201cusing\u201d you. I don\u2019t want the gifts and I will gladly give them back, as well as paying back your previous \u201cinvestment\u201d in me. I\u2019m glad you told me this because it\u2019s clear now that this relationship is transactional to you and you only see me a commodity that can be bought.\u201d\n\nI kept it short. Did not blink when I told him this. I got out of the car, ran to my house, gave him back the gift. I no longer wanted to waste any second of my life on this man. When I put the gift back in the car, this man proceeded to FLIP THE SCRIPT.\n\nHe started calling himself an \u201casshole\u201d, an \u201cidiot\u201d for having the audacity to think that of me. He got out of the car and begged me for forgiveness and asked for another chance. He told me he understood how he may have already messed everything up and that may never forgive him. He explained how he just didn\u2019t want to be used and how I really hurt his feelings by shooting him down for sex after he had been \u201cso nice\u201d to me. He realized that he\u2019s completely wrong about me.\n\nHe held on to my hands and started apologizing profusely. He begged and begged for me to let him talk to me one more time. For me to hug and kiss him again. As soon as this happened, I started GRAY ROCKING IMMEDIATELY. I simply told him to let my hands go. I walked back in my house and I could hear him from behind me crying out my name and saying how sorry he was. Yeah right, not going to work.\n\nI blocked him on everything as soon as I shut that door. I\u2019m not going to prove my worth to someone who believes that I\u2019m a gold digger. I will never be able to change his mind and in order to prove that, he wanted me to have sex with me to \u201cearn his trust.\u201d Yeah no, it\u2019s his loss for messing up his chance with a woman like me. \n\nAn hour later, I opened up my door to get my package, and I noticed that he had left the gift I previously gave him back on my front door along with a bouquet of roses and another small gift. I took them in, put the gifts in our garage and gave the flowers to my mom. I thought about throwing them away but since I absolutely do not care about them, I just treat these gifts like the free samples I received at Costco, I don\u2019t even bother to throw them away.\n\nLadies, I played my cards right since the beginning and did not lose! I am SO PROUD of myself for setting my boundaries and successfully prevented a man from controlling my emotions. This is proof that if you\u2019re in a situation where you cannot block or delete a man for your life, gray rock them! The opposite of love is NOT hate, it is indifference. It is coldness, it is silence. If I would have reacted emotionally, yelling at him in tears, calling him names, he would think that his manipulation tactic had worked and he could continue to play this card until he gets what he wants.\n\nBy not giving him the satisfaction, it kills him inside to see my reaction. He tried to end the relationship to get me into chasing him and it backfired on him. He was the one who threw away his self-respect(if he had any) to beg me for another chance like an idiot, even if he was only lying as a last attempt to get me back, he STILL looked like an idiot. He knew how embarrassing and pathetic he looked at that moment and I walked away with my dignity.","title":"He accused me of being a \u201cgold digger\u201d and threatened to end the relationship after me not wanting to put out on date #5.

They actively discuss how they can make their partner's life better (sometimes out of desperation, unfortunately). But where are the communities where men discuss how they can be good partners and how to make women happy? If a man's aim is to provide value to a woman and become good to her, it would be discussed more. But most of the content you see online are of men talking about how they can sleep with as many women as they can.\n\nAdditionally, men don't seek to educate themselves on how to become a better partner. I've read countless of relationship\/dating books so I know how to navigate relationships better, but most men haven't thought about picking up a single book on how romantic relationships work. They simply go about their lives, interacting with women, unaware aware of how a relationship should be and how to not hurt women. If a man does pick up a book or search Google for advice, it's about how to attract women and how to get them to sleep with him. How shallow is that? But that's how men are.\n\nIf being a better partner is the modern man's goal, the internet isn't reflecting that.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the 21 awards!","title":"If men really wanted to be good boyfriends\/husbands, there would be more communities on it.

All in the hopes of trying to fuck you.\n\nOnce you let a man know about your boundaries, or the fact you're waiting to have sex until you're in a committed\/exclusive relationship, the rug will get pulled out from under you.\n\nThe handsome charming guy that was present for you in the beginning?

The tables have turned, and now he's trying to get you to pursue him before he fades into obscurity.\n\nA man is nice to you until he realizes that he won't be able to have sex with you as soon as he anticipated. Never blame yourself for a man ghosting you. In fact, he did you a favor. Imagine if you did end up sleeping with him after feeling pressured to do so, you would feel a lot worse.\n\nAlways remember that nobody is nicer than a man trying to have sex with you for the first time.

He was a poor excuse for a husband and even a poorer excuse for a dad. Over the past 7 years he has bought every big-boy toy he could want, and had a new home built. (Funny how he had this money when he wanted something...but didn't have it to help his kids.) So, what did I do? I downsized to a smaller home.  I learned how to make repairs myself.  I advanced my career and became a hero to my daughters. I have built up my credit and paid down my debts and started seriously saving for retirement. I also renewed my relationship with my family that had suffered during my marriage because we tended to always do things with his family and not mine. I found new hobbies and have learned to be my own favorite person. \n\nAnd next month I am closing on a fully restored home built in 1925.  It is the home of my dreams. (Fully updated and still all the charm of a historical home.) I will be debt free except for my house. My girls (now 21 and 13) are my 2 biggest supporters.

Porn addicts, fetishists, gamers, incels\/redpillers\/misogynists, etc. flock to Reddit and become increasingly radicalized here.\n\nHVM don't do that stuff. High quality men don't spend hours every day jerking off to porn and spamming feminist subreddits with their dick pics and degenerate \"mUh DiCk\" opinions.\n\nI've noticed that a lot of HVM are even lowkey technologically illiterate. A while back I was talking to a genuinely kind and wholesome man. We were talking about social media, and he asked which one I use the most. When I said \"Reddit\" he said \"read what?\"\n\nI said \"Reddit, you know, it's a discussion-based platform\" and he was like, \"oh, I've never heard of it\"\n\nBless his sweet innocent heart \ud83d\ude0d\n\nRecently I've been taking more breaks from Reddit because I've noticed that spending too much time here is depressing. When I do post here, I generally stick to FDS because the rest of this website is too misogynistic, which affects my mental health. \n\nI'd even go as far as to say that if you're talking to a guy and he says he uses Reddit, RUN. It's a huge red flag if a man uses Reddit. Or at the very least, if he seems like a decent person, ask about his favorite subreddits. If he's here to participate in subs that discuss a particular (non-pornographic) topic\/hobby then that's probably alright.\n\nBut remember, if you ever find yourself browsing the front page and feeling yourself becoming more depressed\/cynical\/negative, don't be afraid to take a break. If you're feeling hopeless about men, remember that shitty men congregate on Reddit, and that this site has a far higher proportion of LVM\/NVM than the general male population.","title":"Friendly reminder that LVM\/NVM are overrepresented on Reddit.

She knew, deep down, that he would leave her in the desert.  She knew, deep down, that he was violent, unstable, and might kill her one day.  But she talked herself out of it, and presented these fears to the police as \"I dont know what came over me, I just panicked and was afraid he would take the van.\"  And the vile, misogynistic pig police officers ate it up and mirrored that back to her, and pathologized her further, saying she was hysterical and had severe mental issues.\n\nPlease know that society does not give a single shit about women.  Many men absolutely hate us.  If you as a woman start telling everyone you have mental issues and anxiety, many people will nod reassuringly, really glad that you have given them a convenient excuse not to believe you, not to hold the men around you accountable for their shitty behavior, that they can now conveniently write you and your fears off. \n\nI have seen men do this time and time and time again.  Trisha Paytas comes to mind- whatever you think about her, she has been 100% accurate about the creepy predatory men on youtube, and yet she's constantly forced to make some public statement about having mental issues.  I can list off so many public female figures that have had to come forward and talk about them having anxiety or an ED or mental issues so the public can feel comfortable about hating on them, from Taylor Swift to Gabbie Hanna to others.  Any woman who publicly beefs with a male will sooner or later have to come out and admit to having some kind of psychological problem.\n\nUnderstand that society has loved labelling women as \"hysterical\" and \"crazy\" since the dawn of time, because then they dont have to listen to women's legitimate concerns about men.  Understand that there is still a ton of pressure on women to come out and reduce their concerns to \"I have bipolar\" \"I have depression\" or whatever.  And when a woman does, the pressure will temporarily reduce, and then that will be used against them forever. (I am not trying to dismiss legitimate mental health issues, but to look at it within the lense of the immense pressure put on women to admit to having a mental issue once they go up against a man)\n\nPLEASE listen to your intuition. PLEASE do not dismiss your legitimate feelings as \"I'm just stressed\", \"I have a lot of anxiety\", \"I dont know why I'm so high strung lately.\"  LISTEN TO HOW BEING AROUND A MAN MAKES YOU FEEL.  IF YOU FEEL STRESSED, ON EDGE, HYSTERICAL, OVER EMOTIONAL, NOT YOURSELF, etc, THAT IS YOUR BODY\/EMOTIONS RESPONDING TO THIS SITUATION.  LEAVE AS SOON AS YOU CAN.  Your life may be at stake.","title":"Women need to stop pathologizing themselves and start listening to their intuition with men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/prj54m\/women_need_to_stop_pathologizing_themselves_and\/"}

I\u2019m tired of all the posts bemoaning the world porn has ruined. I see FAR too many posts waxing poetic about how guys would be these wonderful people and value and love us and treat us like princesses if it wasn\u2019t for porn. STOP IT. That is a lie and a delusion. Furthermore, believing that will only keep you stuck in a mentality that won\u2019t serve you when it comes to men. You will always conflate lack of porn use with an HVM and that\u2019s a false correlation. \n\nI want to be 100% clear. Porn is awful. It definitely is responsible for the exploitation and abuse of untold women and children. It exacerbates the sexual deviance of men. It is absolutely responsible for the trends of abusive sexual assault we see masquerading as kink. *But it did not CREATE these things.* The term sadomasochism was named after the Marquis de Sade, who practiced what we would think of as BDSM back in the 1700s! He literally wrote the book on sexual violence and in it advocated everything from orgies, to rough anal sex, to rape and torture, and public brothels. Sound familiar? He was all about the domination and sexual degradation of women. And that\u2019s just one of the more famous examples. History is littered with these practices. As far back as Ancient Rome and Greece these practices were not only accepted, they were common, along with the sexual abuse of children! I think modern technology spreads certain practices faster, but it\u2019s not giving men ideas they never had. \n\nLet me be frank. Too often, when women wax poetic about the past, it is tone-deaf and sounds ignorant as hell. Yes, men seemed less \u201cdeviant\u201d in the past-because spousal rape wasn\u2019t against the law and the police didn\u2019t bother prosecuting \u2018date rape\u2019 or sexual harassment in the office, not because men respected us more. But yes, even allowing for that, there were fewer white men raping white women. You know why? They were outsourcing all their violence to disenfranchised minority women who couldn\u2019t fight back! I have to say, as a black woman, it has been a real irritation to me to listen to non-WOC go on and on about the good old days before porn. Yeah, those men who were so \u201crespectful\u201d of you were just taking their violence out on black women and other WOC. Read some papers on how many black housemaids in the 50s were raped by their bosses regularly. How many black women civil rights activists were arrested, then beaten and raped. And don\u2019t even get me started on the stats during reconstruction and slavery. And it\u2019s not just black women. We see the same behavior towards any disenfranchised population. Read up about \u2018comfort women\u2019 aka Korean, Chinese, and Filipino women forced into sex slavery during WWII, hundreds of thousands of them! Japanese women were raped indiscriminately after World War II when the country was under American occupation (also in Japanese internment camps in the US). American and other soldiers raped \u2018enemy\u2019 women rampantly and without mercy. And it happened again in Korea. And Vietnam. And Afghanistan. And Iraq. And we see the same attitude today with \u201csexual tourism\u201d of poor Global South countries like Thailand and Cambodia. Married fathers who live perfectly respectable lives in the US and probably don\u2019t even have parking tickets pay to go there and rape children. How come it\u2019s only a problem when they engage in the same behavior here? \n\nIt just feels like when women romanticize men of former periods what they\u2019re saying is, \u201cwhy can\u2019t these men hide their vices, their penchant for rape and violent sexual abuse, like their fathers and grandfathers did? Why do *I* have to deal with this?\u201d WOC have never had the luxury of not dealing with this reality. This is not to say MOC aren\u2019t just as horrible as white men, because they totally are, worse in some ways. But I\u2019m talking about porn and culture right now, and that market was created by w.hite men like Hugh Hefner and became the cultural landscape because of the dissemination of porn by other powerful w.hite men like Larry Flynt. If you want to say you wish men were better, that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t we all. But don\u2019t wish we could \u201cgo back.\u201d That means, \u201cI wish I could buy a happier life at someone else\u2019s expense. I wish I had the fantasy of a picture-perfect marriage sustained by my husband raping powerless women who can never complain.\u201d\n\nPorn is not the issue. Porn isn\u2019t making these men into monsters. They were already monsters. They were monsters when the \u201cfather of modern gynecology\u201d practiced by torturing, experimenting on, and cutting up living enslaved black women who were not even sick with no anesthesia. They were monsters when mass rape was used as a weapon of war in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and all over Africa during colonization. They were monsters when they were raping Native women all over the Trail of Tears. And they\u2019re monsters still now that they go onto reservations to rape defenseless women because those are sovereign lands and they can\u2019t be prosecuted by American law on them. Just like they were monsters when they made a legal loophole that said enslaved black women were \u201cunrapeable\u201d because they couldn\u2019t consent as property, then used the loophole to rape them. There wasn\u2019t widespread digital porn then, yet these men spent their resources thinking of and creating the means to facilitate widespread rape for hundreds of years. Porn is a mirror. It reflects the nature of men who use it, it doesn\u2019t transform them.","title":"Stop saying porn ruined men.

The presence of one man (no matter how much they believe they\u2019re \u201cone of the good ones!\u201d) defeats the purpose (even if they stay silent). I think that\u2019s why so many men get enraged by this sub; we make it clear that they are not wanted here and will not be tolerated here and they HATE that. Incidentally it\u2019s one of the reasons I absolutely love this place! If you post anywhere else on Reddit (or online tbh) that even remotely criticizes men (or one man tbh), the topic will inevitably and rapidly be derailed by angry men telling me that \u201caCtUAlLy women are also the problem and here\u2019s why you\u2019re a bitch!\u201d\n\nI have left \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d clubs, groups, etc because I showed up with the expectation that it would be a women\u2019s club but, alas, men had consistently invaded those spaces. One even tried to run for an officer position. All of them thought that being there meant they were suuuper fuckable (obviously they came across as incredible unfuckable, 0\/10, and completely insufferable). Like, it\u2019s not enough that they have to trespass, but they also expect to be rewarded for doing so! It\u2019s condescending, infantilizing, and it irritates me to no end. \n\nThe essential appeal of safe spaces for women is that no men are there. We all have a lot to discuss regarding men and frankly, men 100% cannot participate if we\u2019re going to get anything done. Men cannot handle what we have to say about their behavior and I can\u2019t speak freely knowing there\u2019s a chance some annoying and aggressive dude invades my space to mansplain women\u2019s issues to me. Obviously that\u2019s also by design, but I\u2019m so sick of the arrogance, entitlement, and invasion. Leave us alone!\n\nTo any angry lurkers- every single man is a threat to women, yes, even you, so stay away from where you\u2019re not wanted.","title":"Safe spaces for women CANNOT have men!

I often tried to recreate that intense romance with LVM that media, movies, books and society brainwashed me to think that was the be all and end all of what I needed in my life. I used to cry, beg, and explain till I was blue in the face to LVM that the right thing to do was to treat me with humanity and empathy \ud83e\udd21\nI projected my own empathy and kindness onto them. \n\nBegging and pleading and crying made them respect me less, they didn't listen or care. One of the biggest FDS lessons I learnt is that men respond to actions, not reasoning, not emotions, and definitely not you over-communicating. You should not threaten them with leaving either. Leaving a man should be calculated and well planned and thought out. This way you're prepared for any response. Don't go back to them either. Men have less respect and more contempt for women who go back to them. \n\nWhen I've cried and begged to be treated with basic human decency in my pickme days they just stared blank face at my tears or berated me. When I left with no emotion, they cried, pleaded begged and started jumping hoops to give me what I wanted. \n\nYou can cry to your trusted friends, family, therapist. But don't cry and plead with LVM. You're allowed to feel hurt. Just don't beg. If you're sensitive and cry during a breakup that's fine too. Just be firm in your stance on the breakup, don't explain or beg. You can cry those silent tears while you pack up and leave.","title":"Don't cry, beg or show emotion or over communicate.

I'm exhausted doing it all myself while he plays video games 24\/7.\" \n\nWell, my dear FDS ladies, I'm here to share the one simple, foolproof way to get your partner to contribute.\n\nYou replace him.\n\nYeah, you just throw the whole man out and get a new one. That's the only way to get your partner to contribute his fair share to chores, cooking, and household management.\n\nNo couple is going to be on the exact same page about how to run a household when they move in together, but if you're with someone with expectations wildly different than yours (i.e. he wants you to do 85% of the work while he does 15%), there's no way to course correct. No amount of communicating, conversations, chore charts (...), begging, etc. will get him to help you. You either need to find a new relationship with someone who views household management through the same lens as you or accept that this is your life now. And well, the first option is much better for your happiness and mental wellness. Trust me.","title":"The simple, foolproof way to get your partner to contribute his fair share to chores, cooking, and household management.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/q0jmgy\/the_simple_foolproof_way_to_get_your_partner_to\/"}

But the reality is we are letting a man *into our body*. It is a union. It makes us vulnerable. Before having sex with someone we should be asking ourselves \"Is this somebody I want to be attached to? In love with? Totally vulnerable to?\" We also have to work to maintain perspective so we can leave if the mask falls or things don't work out. \n\nSex is also part of the vetting process.

I found this thread by accident, shared by men that were bashing it, calling the women here \"female incels.\" I came in to look at it with the mindset it was going to be laughable. I honestly feel like something is breaking inside of me. I read through a bunch of the threads, and tried to understand the acronyms and terms used. NV, LV, and HV I'm assuming are No Value, Low Value, and High Value, correct me if I'm wrong please. I've been in a few shitty relationships, and the last one made me feel like I had grown as a woman after a lot of reflection and advice, I felt like it was completely my fault that the relationship was bad, or existed for that matter. One of my female coworkers told me I needed to set and maintain boundaries, and it is ok to have needs and expectations. I was a literal doormat for my last serious boyfriend, I made tons of excuses for him and his behavior. Reading these threads, I think I'm currently, and have always been, a \"pickme.\" I usually pride myself in my attractivness to men, both physically and mentally. Being a \"gamer girl,\" drinking beer with \"the boys,\" fishing, playing pool, etc, but I try to be nonchalant about it all because I feel like that looks better, even though I'm literally putting myself in those situations seeking praise. I enjoy being told \"I'm not like other girls,\" or \"I'm so down to Earth,\" etc. One thread mentioned that pickmes will choose hobbies based on how cool they sound or their interest to men. I feel like my entire life and personality are all lies. From my job, to my car, to my hobbies. I didn't have many friends growing up and I'm almost afraid of interacting with women, so I don't really have a female support system, and have always felt a pang of envy when I see a group of women, enjoying each others company. I know I enjoy male attention and fall pretty easily into whatever they want from me, if the interest is mutual. Honestly, this information is pretty scary because I know I can be bad about accepting accountability and have a lack of willpower, but all I want is a loving partner who understands me and appreciates me, because I feel like I pour my entire soul into my relationships. I feel like I live for that person, and my therapist told me I'm emotionally dependant. (Go figure.) I've even been pining for my ex recently. I don't even know where to start with myself. And so, I guess this super long rant was just to say thank you, scary, poweful internet women, holy hell, I've got a lot of thinking to do.","title":"Eye-Openening","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/oejs6r\/eyeopenening\/"}

We are shamed for having expensive tastes and choosing disposable income and singledom over virtuous poverty shackled to a man and children. Romantic comedies of the 80's and 90's showed us that the successful, badass career woman is secretly sadfacing because *she doesn't have a boyfriend* (and it's not like she could ever have emotionally fulfilling relationships with family or friends).

It's not like we're just being \"mean\" to men for no reason. \n\nComing up with counter-strategies to protect ourselves from abuse is not the same as actually being an abuser.\n\nSaying FDS is \"redpill for women\" is like saying a domestic abuse shelter is no different than a summer camp for rapists.\n\nIt would be like if you saw a man beating the shit out of a woman and the moment she throws her hands up in a guard to block his punches, you dismiss her and then conclude that both of these things are equally violent and that these two parties are \"abusing each other\"\n\nProtecting yourself from abuse is not abusive.","title":"FDS is anti-redpill.

There were so many moments in this episode that resonated with me, but that sentence alone brought to the surface so many emotions I didn't even know I had. All this time I was thinking SWERFs were my enemy but it made me realize this is just another way to keep women divided and fighting each other instead of patriarchy. You 3 ladies talk about us in a more humanising way than most of my clients.\n\nI'm an escort and camgirl and I found Female Dating Strategy because of that Twitter thread. I admit at first I was caught up in the heat of the moment and thought it was highly tone deaf and offensive. But as soon as I listened to the Male Socialization episode of the podcast I was hooked. Immediately binged all of the other episodes and was left hungry for more. You ladies are so smart, funny, and articulate, and your message is so needed.\n\nThank you for addressing what you meant by those tweets in this episode, it may just have saved my life. I couldn't sleep after listening to the Sex Work episode, I was tossing and turning all night re-evaluating my life. \"What the fuck am I doing? I have a degree. I don't need to be doing this. I'm not even making that much money. When I was a little girl I had all these dreams about changing the world and now I'm sleeping with old men for money. I dissociate every time I have sex. What the fuck am I doing with my life\"\n\nBrowsing the subreddit since then has really solidified my decision that I need to quit this line of work (especially that post, \"sex work is just another way for patriarchy to keep women out of the workforce\"). \n\nIn the past few months I've been feeling more and more negative about my job. It's making me depressed and when I'm not working I just lie in bed looking at memes to distract me from feeling like shit about myself. \n\nI'm one of those \"former gifted kids\" and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about all the teachers who recommended me, who supported me, who told me I had \"so much potential\" and I just feel so much shame like they would be disappointed in me for what I'm doing now.\n\nYou ladies inspired me to actually put my degree (social work) to good use. My dream now is to become a social worker who supports other sex workers, I hope to use my experience to help them leave this industry and transition to civilian work.\n\nI know I'm facing an uphill battle trying to get out, myself. I'm dreading having to explain the gap on my resume. I'm paranoid that other people will find out. I'm afraid of my past being used against me and holding me back, career-wise.\n\nA big part of the reason why sex workers are trying to normalize sex work as any ordinary profession is precisely because we are afraid of what might happen when we try to leave. Deep down we know that society won't accept us once we are \"contaminated\" so that's why we are trying to change that. That's why we get so mad at SWERFs because we feel you are perpetuating the stigmatization of sex work that keeps us unsafe and makes our lives more difficult.\n\nBut now I realize that this attempt to normalize sex work also has the unintended consequence of grooming young girls into an industry that will ultimately destroy them. I know if we lived in a perfect world where men weren't sexist pigs, ~~it wouldn't be a big deal if young girls were getting into sex work~~ (edit: changed my mind on this, it's still dangerous), but unfortunately we don't live in that world yet and it's foolish to pretend like we do (the phrase \"liberal fairytales\" is a total paradigm shift for me, thank you for adding that to my vocabulary). \n\nI related so hard when Lilith said, \"I'm embarrassed that I used to be complicit in that\" because that's exactly how I feel about some of the things I've put on the internet in the past. A lot of it was just self-serving and cope. Shame, embarrassment, fear and so on are powerful emotions and are a big reason why so many sex workers aren't ready to come to terms with some of the things we've done.\n\nSorry for the long comment\/post, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you so much for all the work you do and I'm sorry for the stuff I said about FDS before. The way that you keep doing what you do despite all the crap you get is admirable. Please, never give up, don't get burned out, keep fighting. You are saving people's lives.\n\nPS my ears pricked up when Lilith mentioned whorephobia and said she had more to say about it later in the episode but then didn't mention it again. I'm still curious to know what she meant by that, and I hope she elaborates in a future post or episode. Thanks!\n\nEdit: I put my phone down for a few hours and I come back to this, so many comments and kind messages! Thank you so much everyone for your support!","title":"I'm an escort and camgirl.

She's asking how she can move on from it.\n\nMost of the women were telling her to dump him but of course a bunch of males and libfems were saying stuff like \"every single man fantasises about your\/his sexy friends, it's just a fantasy, move on\" blah blah blah. One comment from a libfem said how she used to be jealous of her husband doing this but she \"got rid of her insecurities\" and \"now doesn't need to know what's going on with his female friends\" and that she \"doesn't know how he didn't break up with her.\" \ud83e\udd21\n\nPersonally I feel like there's a bit of a difference between fantasising about a celebrity and literally masturbating to photos of someone in your life that you interact with. It's not cheating but I consider it close enough. It's also A LIE that every man (and woman) does this. No, not every man is out there masturbating to photos of your friends. Maybe I'm giving them too much credit but I'm willing to bet there's some monogamous, non-creepy dudes out there who won't do this.\n\nSo don't settle for bad behaviour just because \"it's the way dudes are\". It's not, and even if it is, don't date them. Do not accept disrespect.\n\nEdit: Also this is yet another example of why you should never ask Reddit for advice outside of female-only subreddits. Men are biased when giving advice. Their aim is to ensure men as a group can continue acting in a bad way and get away with it. Is it ok to masturbate to photos of your girlfriend's friend? No, but they're going to tell you that it's ok so the cycle of cheating continues.","title":"Don't accept shitty behaviour just because \"every man does it\"!!!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/ouiqlk\/dont_accept_shitty_behaviour_just_because_every\/"}

Or worse, he leaves her in the dust without even turning his head to see if she's still with him.\n\nWhen a man does this to his wife or girlfriend it means he doesn't give a shit about her.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, when a man truly loves and cares about a woman, he will be considerate of her walking pace and will slow down to a speed that is comfortable for her. He will turn his head from time to time to check in with her and make sure she's still walking next to him.\n\nAnytime I've ever called a guy out for walking way faster than me, he goes \"i cAnT HeLp iT cUz iM TaLLeR tHaN u\" which is bullshit because one of the HVMs I dated was 6'5\" and he had no issues with slowing down to accommodate the people he was with, because he was a *thoughtful and considerate person.*\n\nFor those of you who are in relationships with men who do this, you might be thinking to yourself \"wow what a stupid reason to break up with someone\" and that him walking faster than you is not that big of a deal.\n\nHere's the thing though: if he's like that with you now, he will continue to be like that in the future, even if you are pregnant, injured, or carrying a baby.\n\nMy parents used to tell me all the time what it was like going out in public together when I was a baby. My dad would park the car and immediately walk into the store or restaurant without even checking on my mom. She got left behind having to deal with unbuckling me from the car seat, and then he would get frustrated with her for taking so long. He did this when she was pregnant too, by the way. Just... speedwalking ahead while she waddles 20 feet behind him, 8 months pregnant. \n\nMy mom used to \"joke\" that she couldn't let him take me anywhere alone because apparently there were a couple times where he \"forgot\" me in the back seat of the car and she couldn't trust him not to let me die from being cooked alive in a hot car.\n\nThe sort of man who does this is communicating that he is selfish and inconsiderate. When someone tells you who they are, *believe them.*\n\nEdit: Holy shit why are men SO TRIGGERED by this post? I'm laughing so hard at the pretty clear gender divide in the comments and my inbox. Women are like *\"YES this is so relatable! My ex always walked faster than me and he turned out to be extremely abusive! Wish I saw this 5 years ago, would have saved me a lot of trauma!\"* Meanwhile the triggered scrotes are outing themselves as abusers by getting defensive like *\"NUH UH, this is the dumbest post I've ever seen, why not jUsT cOmMuNiCaTe?

The woman in the relationship was apparently insisting that her boyfriend text her throughout the night any time he went out without her. The boyfriend refused, saying he was an adult and he wasn\u2019t obliged to check in with anyone, blah blah blah. We all pretty much agreed that if you don\u2019t trust someone to behave themselves in that kind of situation, then you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with them in the first place. I fell a bit more on the side of \u201cwell, if that\u2019s something she really needs then I\u2019m sure she can find someone she\u2019s compatible with. And if this guy doesn\u2019t want to do that then I\u2019m sure he can find someone he\u2019s more compatible with too.\u201d\n\nAnyway, the story goes on. One night the couple are going out for drinks and decide to pregame a bit in their home. The boyfriend prepares the drinks, the girlfriend has one drink and is out cold for the entire night. The boyfriend still goes out while she\u2019s passed out in the bedroom. The next morning he\u2019s talking about how it\u2019s \u201cso nice to not have you constantly texting me.\u201d She asks if he put something in her drink and he says yes, because he wanted her to stop nagging. \n\nBITCH WHAT?? Obviously we were all horrified at his actions, but the friend who was telling story seemed to take the tack of \u201cyeah, both people behaved badly in that situation.\u201d Sis was comparing someone\u2019s bad behavior to a man\u2019s CRIME. One of the people at the table said \u201coh so they were both toxic.\u201d\n\nI felt like I was crazy.

Even before discovering this sub, I felt like they were low value but couldn\u2019t put my finger on why. \n\nMaybe 1\/10 FOBs are supportive and helpful to a mom who literally just grew another human inside of her and is now not only recovering, but doing the majority of the care for their newborn. It is almost NEVER 50\/50, even if the FOB is helpful. They just simply don\u2019t have the maternal intuition that women have after birth because of hormones - people can argue about this but there are so many studies and it\u2019s nature\/science.\n\nThe rest of the 9\/10? They complain. About lack of sleep. About having to wait 6 weeks to have sex with the mom (this is such a common question and it disgusts me more every time). They ignore the mom and flirt with staff. They make inappropriate jokes. They sleep while the mom takes care of the baby. They talk about drama with their other baby mommas. They sit on their phone all day\/night and ignore their newborn child. I\u2019ve seen FOBs lay in bed ignoring their crying infant and expect the mom, who just had MAJOR SURGERY 24 hours ago (c-section), change the baby or feed it a bottle. The audacity.\n\n1\/10 of the helpful and supportive men category are actually high value. You can tell by how he treats the mom. He is encouraging, he NEVER complains about lack of sleep, he asks the mom how she is feeling throughout the day and how he can best support her. The couple is always married or engaged. He kisses her head and tells her she looks beautiful, and isn\u2019t embarrassed to do it in front of family\/staff. I\u2019ve had an FOB go get Cheesecake Factory (40 min drive from my hospital) because the mom didn\u2019t like the hospital food.
