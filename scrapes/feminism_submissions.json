No one gets called an incel or a fascist without a reason; most times I\u2019ve seen women use those terms, it was because the man\u2019s behavior warranted it. This generation are fans of Andrew Tate, Joe Rogan, Elon Musk. If you don\u2019t want to be called an incel, maybe don\u2019t idolize men who openly denigrate women. Teachers are even saying that boys in schools are becoming increasingly sexist towards girls. Women have to deals with a generation of boys that admire men who rape women and told them women are inferiors, shouldn\u2019t vote, are properties yet we aren\u2019t voting for a party that wants to remove men\u2019s rights.\n\nIt seems that because women aren\u2019t coddling men anymore when they disrespects them and instead respond and call out them, the men are getting angry and turning to misogyny, claiming that women hate men. They are also resentful of the democrats for paying more attention to women\u2019s issues.\nAnd in response,they decide to vote for the party that works against women\u2019s rights, ironically proving the women who called them incels right. One of them even told me that he didn\u2019t voted Harris just because women rejected him.\n They can\u2019t accept that women no longer fit the submissive, obedient \u201ctrad wife\u201d ideal that someone like Andrew Tate promotes. Instead of empathizes with women and tries to understand why they chose the bear for exemple they prefer to blame them punish them and become even more misogynistic.","title":"Gen Z men are basically frustrated that women won\u2019t stay silent about mistreatment so they vote for a party that wants to reduce women\u2019s rights as punishment- then blame women for it.

The dress code was black. I was scared that some men would try to take my pics and bully me. I think Almost all women had the same thoughts because it happens frequently in Korea. It\u2019s so normal. That\u2019s why Korean feminism protests accept only women. We\u2019re always worried about taking pictures\u2026 \n\nHowever, it can\u2019t stop us. 6K women came here. Most victims are minors or university students. We must come here for victims.\n\nAlthough the protest was scheduled to start at 3 PM, women were still lining up to join. Someone didn\u2019t know about this protest until walking the street, but she participated in this protest. The staff were worried about her identity bc she didn\u2019t wear a mask or hat. However, she was so brave. She participated in it without a mask. \n\nWe shared jelly and chocolates with unknown women and smiled. We\u2019re not alone.\n\nI met a lot of brave and kind women in this protest.\n\nI heard an 11th-grade girl's address. She said she was so scared but she knew that girls needed to shout at governments and Korea. She was so brave.\n\nI heard another address that a feminist said. In SK, many women haven\u2019t participated in protests for 6 years bc there was a backlash and threats about women. She started feminism due to them, but she couldn\u2019t meet her sisters for 6 years. She cried saying she didn\u2019t think that she met sisters 6 years ago, but today she met. The day that we met came. \n\nI think we will gather more, bc the promotion wasn\u2019t strong and it was a first protest. \n\nI\u2019ve got a lot of messages and supports to foreign sisters. I can run to here thanks to you. Thanks a lot. You\u2019re so kind and sweet.\n\nAfter this protest, I\u2019m planning to write something for report as soon as possible. I believe our feminism movements wasn\u2019t not only for Korean women, but also women all over the world. I hope my efforts can help you. \n\nAs you said, there is nowhere for women. So, I\u2019ll do my best for women as i can.\n\nThank you for listening to a wall of texts.\n","title":"In SK, 6K women on gathered to protest against Deepfake","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/1fm49ty"}

The percentage of women in management positions remains low (about 12% on average), and many women are economically and socially disadvantaged. Mothers still handle the majority of housework and childcare, which significantly limits their ability to pursue promotions or stable careers. (And there are still quite a few families where sons are expected to carry on the family line, and daughters are expected to take care of aging parents)\n\nIt is still not permitted for married couples to have different surnames. Japan\u2019s abortion laws have been criticized by the WHO as problematic. Married women are required to obtain their husband\u2019s consent in order to get an abortion.\n\nMany non-regular workers in Japan are women, and even those in regular positions are often placed in roles called \u201cippanshoku\u201d (general staff), where they\u2019re given only menial tasks like making tea or photocopying, with little to no chance of promotion.\n\nSexual harassment in the workplace is also far from unusual, but decision-makers are mostly men, and it\u2019s common for victims to be ignored or silenced. In my own case, I sought help through a labor consultation service and ended up experiencing secondary harm, with no resolution. Taking legal action requires money that many women simply can\u2019t afford.\n\nStarting a business isn\u2019t easy either. 52.4% of women who launched startups reported experiencing sexual harassment during the process.\n\nOn Japanese television, sexual harassment was broadcast as comedy content for decades, and some comedians who proudly confessed to assaulting women are still on TV. \nMeanwhile, it is rare for the media to focus on issues such as misogyny or sexual violence.\nThe sexual abuse committed by Johnny Kitagawa and the scandals involving Fuji TV were both brought to public attention due to external pressure from abroad.\n\nMany women in Japan don\u2019t even realize that what\u2019s happening to them is gender-based discrimination. There is still a long way to go before these problems become visible to the broader public.\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken even a moment to think about what women in Japan are facing, thank you. We need solidarity, and we need to be heard.","title":"I\u2019m a Japanese woman and I\u2019d like to share some issues women face in Japan.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Feminism\/comments\/1kk1l5a\/im_a_japanese_woman_and_id_like_to_share_some\/"}

Has dinner at 2 am with junior interns and decides to close her eyes for a while in the seminar room of her hospital.\n\n2.\t\u2060At 11.30 am in the morning, parents of the female doctor receive a call saying their daughter is ill. When they asked for more info, the cops said \u201cwe are not doctors, we do not know\u201d.\n\n3.\t\u2060The parents arrive at the hospital and meet the cops, to which the cops say your daughter committed suicide and they are made to wait for 3 hours to see her body.\n\n4.\t\u2060Meanwhile, the principal of the institution has started saying the female doctor had psychosis and has committed suicide.\n\n5.   Parents see body which was being guarded by other doctors who refused to leave the body. They notice grave injuries on her half naked body, blood streaming down her eyes, glass shards crushed into her eyes, her hips split at 90 degrees, genital mutilation among various other injuries on a mattress soaked with blood. The doctors demand a judicial magistrate come and perform the inquest. The police record this case as an Unnatural Death(suicide).\n\n6.\t\u2060Outrage across the state of West Bengal and the Indian medical community as the primary inquest report leaks and everyone sees the extent of injuries which could not have even been confused with suicide.\n\n7. The parents are allegedly hurried into cremating their daughter\u2019s body. In fact, when they met the police for the first time; the police commissioner Mr Goyal allegedly told the parents don\u2019t dig up this matter anymore as it\u2019s not worth it and allegedly also offered a monetary settlement to cremate the body.\n\n8. A suspect is arrested and his violent history put on display by the local law enforcement. The fellows of the fallen doctor cry foul over the attempted rush to close the investigation and irregularities in forensics. It is recorded before the High Court it would require \u201csuperhuman strength for a single person to perform injuries of this extent over 30-45 minutes under intoxication, hence there is a high likelihood of multiple suspects.\u201d\n\n9.\t\u2060Women across West Bengal did \u201cReclaim the Night\u201d candle night vigil seeking justice for the victim on Aug 15 at 12 am, India\u2019s Independence Day.\n\n10. On 16\/8, Calcutta High Court slams the local govt and law enforcement for non implementation of safety measures to protect the protesting doctors. The Honorable Judge asked why was the \u201crenovations\u201d taking place now of all times? It is stated in court that the goons were mobilized to destroy the crime scene but miscounted the floors and ended up destroying the floor below the crime scene. Also on record that the police gave way for entry of the mob and was hiding rather than protecting the protestors.\n\nWe're protesting but not getting justice. How come we women are not even safe in our workplaces in our country? Please help us by spreading this news so it becomes mainstream news internationally. This will pressure our government to seek justice for the victim and make reforms to increase the safety of women. We are suffocating and we need your help.\n\nEdit 1: Protests, rallies, dharnas are now banned around Kolkata's RG Kar hospital (where the rape murder incident took place) for 7 days...\n\nEdit 2: 43 professors who were protesting with the students are now being transferred to other colleges...","title":"The brutal rape murder case of a female doctor trainee has shaken India and we, Indian women, are scared","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Feminism\/comments\/1eus53n\/the_brutal_rape_murder_case_of_a_female_doctor\/"}

That periods are disgusting and shameful, and should be kept secret. We aren't even properly taught about our own anatomy- a lot of women don't know until later in life that the vulva and vagina are separate, and that the urethra is not the same opening as the vaginal opening.\n\nThere's hardly any research into female-specific medical conditions. Nearly 10% (1 in 10) women are afflicted with endometriosis, yet there's literally no research on what causes it. PCOS is also under-researched. It's all shoved under the rug, too stigmatised to be discussed.\n\nWhile boys can talk freely about their dick and balls, the words \"vagina\" or \"vulva,\" are still treated like a humiliating joke at best, and a vulgar obscenity at worst.\n\nMen talk with pride about their genitals. To \"grow a set\" = to start acting tough and assertive. To \"have big balls\" = to be brave. \"Big dick energy\" = to be a charismatic \"alpha\" that commands attention.\n\nMeanwhile, there are no positive cultural connotations regarding the vulva\/vagina. Even \"serving cunt\" is used as a tongue-in-cheek memetic joke.\n\nI think it's very predatory that shame, disgust and aversion about having a vagina\/vulva is marketed as a sign that a girl\/woman is dysphoric. That it should just be censored and called a \"front hole\" or a \"bonus hole,\" to avoid the stigma.

Strangulation (sanitised into choking), violence, degradation etc. All justified under the umbrella of \u201ckink\u201d and a mountain of porn sites feeding men the lie that women want this. That we crave being hit, gagged, choked, slapped, degraded. \n\nPorn has radicalized a generation of men to see women as holes.

I\u2019m saying we need to reckon with the fact that the line between kink and abuse is not as thick as we like to pretend, and porn is doing everything it can to erase that line.\n\nIm so fucking done with sex positivity being used to actively hurt and harm women.

People act like it\u2019s some wholesome, progressive sitcom, but honestly, it\u2019s packed with the same outdated garbage that\u2019s been shoved down our throats for decades \u2014 just with a shiny \u201cmodern\u201d label slapped on top.\n\n- Gloria is literally a walking fetish. Her entire character is \u201chot, loud Latina with an accent.\u201d That\u2019s it. The show treats her like a joke and a sex object. She barely ever has real depth or agency. She\u2019s just there to look good and yell in broken English. \n\nLet\u2019s be real:\nGloria is a Colombian immigrant. She\u2019s a single mom who raised her son on her own. She left a violent background. She navigated a new country, learned a second language, and built a new life. That\u2019s incredibly compelling. There\u2019s so much potential there \u2014 trauma, resilience, strength, independence. But do we ever really explore that?\n\n- Claire does all the emotional labor, all the parenting, all the organizing \u2014 and she\u2019s painted as this uptight, nagging control freak. Meanwhile, Phil gets to be a man-child who screws everything up and still gets treated like he\u2019s adorable. Imagine doing everything and still being the punchline.\n\n- The daughters? One is hot and dumb, the other is smart and ugly. No nuance, no real character growth, just two cardboard cutouts of tired-ass stereotypes.\n\n\n- Even the gay couple is trapped in straight dynamics. Cam is emotional and flamboyant, Mitchell is cold and logical. It\u2019s just heterosexual gender roles. There\u2019s nothing subversive about it.\n\n\nThe humor is stuck in the 1950s. \u201cMen are clueless! Women are bossy! Moms overreact! Dads just wanna watch TV!\u201d Seriously? This is what we were calling groundbreaking?\n\nIt\u2019s honestly depressing that Modern Family got praised for being progressive when it\u2019s just a dressed-up version of every lazy, sexist sitcom that came before it. You can throw in a gay couple or a brown person, but if you\u2019re still running the same sexist playbook, you haven\u2019t evolved \u2014 you\u2019ve just rebranded.\n\nI don\u2019t care how funny people think it is \u2014 it\u2019s tired, insulting, and honestly kind of gross.","title":"Modern Family is actually super sexist and I\u2019m kind of shocked people don\u2019t talk about it more","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Feminism\/comments\/1kvmyn1\/modern_family_is_actually_super_sexist_and_im\/"}

My sociology advisor had done studies about the social mores of the gynecology visit, including the more or less standard practice of hiding your underwear after you take off your bottoms. \n\nWhen asked to undress from the waist down, my husband just dropped his pants today and then kicked them under the chair. He then didn\u2019t even use the little paper \u201cblanket\u201d just sat there. Like I get they were going to move it anyway but I thought his behavior was so outside the norm. Then I was talking to the nurse about this and apparently this is just how men (in her experience) act.\n\n They don\u2019t hide their underwear. They rarely use the paper blanket to hide they genitals. Half the time they don\u2019t even wait for the practitioner to leave the room to take off their clothes.  The whole ritual of hiding your body from the medical professional just does not exist for 1\/2 the population. \n\nDo men overall not feel the shame of their bodies that woman are brainwashed into feeling from childhood? Also like I would never feel ok just leaving my pants on the floor. What if this person I am paying an insane amount to see thinks I\u2019m messy? My husband absolutely did not understand why I thought his behavior was so taboo. \n\nAnyway.

Many people complained more about her laughing a lot than the stuff that Trump has said. Do people forget that Trump said that if Ivanka wasn't his daughter, she would probably be dating him? \n\nMy mother actually told me men make better leaders than women do since they have stronger characteristics. Does she really think Trump has stronger characteristics than Harris does? Harris is a lot more coherent and intelligent than he is. \n\nA good reason why she has stronger characteristics than Trump does is because of the fact that when she lost the election, she acted maturely and accepted the results and didn't claim voter fraud like how Trump did when he lost the 2020 election. Trump has proven himself to be a weaker person than Harris. \n\nPeople complained about Biden's age, but Trump is only 4 years younger than him, and he still won the election despite the fact that he is 18 years older than Harris. \n\nMany people who voted for Trump actually think Project 2025 is fake. Project 2025 is not fake at all. It's been proven to be an actual thing. [Project 2025 is real and is coming says Trumper Matt Walsh](https:\/\/www.advocate.com\/election\/project-2025-coming-matt-walsh)\n\nIt's disgusting that so many men still voted for Trump despite the fact that they have wives, mothers, daughters, sisters, and female friends. Do they care at all about what could happen to them as a result?\n\nBecause of stuff like that, it is going to be much harder for men to get a girlfriend now. Their dating pool is going to become a lot significantly smaller. Because of stuff like Roe v Wade being overturned and the last election, many women are going to consider avoiding dating men and going celibate, and I can see why they are doing that. \n\nSadly, Gerald Ford is right that we will never get a female president through an electoral process. The United States has a lot of sexist people in it.

The female students reached out to Teacher Ji Hye-bok for help, and she responded immediately. She anonymously confirmed the details of the abuse from the girls and assessed the extent of the harm.\n threats. They gathered in the hallways during breaks, loudly calling for a \u2018male solidarity\u2019 movement, putting immense pressure on the victims.\n\n\nThe real problem started afterward. The teacher who took over handling the #MeToo incident after Ji did not consider the victims. He exposed the list of victims who reported the abusers, allowing the perpetrators to threaten the victims without intervention. He also called the victims, telling them that they might have \u2018exaggerated\u2019 the facts and that all statements would be recorded, which directly violates South Korea\u2019s educational guidelines!\n\nAfter learning the names of the victims, the perpetrators began to show up in their classrooms armed with box cutters, kicking desks, and making threats. They gathered in the hallways during breaks, loudly calling for a \u2018male solidarity\u2019 movement, putting immense pressure on the victims.\n\n\nIn the end, the victims were too frightened to continue reporting, and the school\u2019s #MeToo movement ended on a much smaller scale than initially identified. The perpetrators were only asked to submit a \u2018reflection letter\u2019 or were found \u2018not guilty.\u2019\n\nWhile the victims suffered, the school did nothing. When Ji Hye-bok learned of this, the school tried to transfer her to another school, fearing she would protest. Ji staged a one-person protest in front of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education. Her protest was recognized by 77 lawyers as having a \u2018public purpose,\u2019 but the Seoul office ignored this, accusing her of abandoning her duties and dismissing her from her position.\n\nSouth Korea does not protect underage women, especially when it comes to sexual issues. They behave as if one gender\u2019s rights do not exist.\n\nThe link below is an interview with Teacher Ji Hye-bok.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/SmnuqI5C9RI?si=tbcAAxK2Sy7DrQbt","title":"SK fired a teacher who led the school #MeToo movement.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/1fqo2mj"}

I don't care if I get blocked for saying this (for what it's worth, I know that I got blocked for doing the right thing) but I don't want to be in an app that is complicit in allowing kids and teenagers to get preyed on by pedophiles\/ephebophiles.\n2. As of writing this post, there are 3.2 million members on this sub-reddit.\n\nI'm not internet-savvy and I'm a rare user of reddit so I am unaware on how to report a sub-reddit, I honestly don't even know if doing so is possible. If it weren't for that, I would have reported that sub-reddit immediately. I need some advice, on what to do, because I feel helpless. I so badly want to do something about this. I request all of you who have seen this post to do something about this, we all are responsible. I feel digust, it's safe to say that I'm not gonna sleep tonight. I'm at a loss of words.\n\nAdvice on what to do would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance all,\n\nMaria John (she\/her\/hers).\n\nSmall Note: I apologise in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors. I hope this post is legible. English is not my first language, so please bear with me.","title":"Reddit has a pedophilia problem.\n","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Feminism\/comments\/1d8jnmq\/reddit_has_a_pedophilia_problem\/"}

News flash, all genders have bad apples. No one wants to date someone who's all butthurt and resentful. Women aren't bad, that specific person was bad, generalizing one bad experience to be reprosentative of all women is just overt sexism. \n\nDating has always been challenging and the ways it is challenging have changed over time. But fundementally the issue is men are being defeatist af about it and giving up. Instead of rising to the occasion, working on themselves, developing skills, etc etc. When you hear them talk about why they can't get a date it's so obvious what the true reason is, because all they do is make excuses and blame women and spout sexist myths.\n\nLike, I see so many people saying things about how \"women only care about looks, if you aren't a 9+ you don't stand a chance\". And it's just like, have you ever gone outside and looked around? I see average people in relationships everywhere I go. I know tons of extremely attractive people who are single af. \n\nOr they complain about a bunch of stuff that is really just the patriarchies fault but blame women for it instead. Like having to pay for dates, or the expectation to be muscular and rich, both of which they are putting on themselves, and could easily be let go of if they just rejected the patriarchy. \n\nIt has more do to with your aproach than anything, and your aproach is something completely within your control. Just be respectful, take no for an answer, accept rejection as an inevitable part of the process. Everyone is a 10 to someone, everyone is looking for different things. The right person is out there for you. Just focus on becoming a good person, work on your communication and conflict resolution skills, be kind, and be patient. Develop good values and morals, learn to actually care about the things women care about, take consent and boundaries seriously, show you are a real ally. \n\nThe worst thing you can possibly do is develop a complex about it. Just because your self fulfilling prophecy came true doesn't mean it was in any way inevitable. Its not that difficult to get a girlfriend if you just don't hate women.

I asked them if they wouldn't rather be free and actually have career prospects, if none of them were concerned about the fact that women were routinely abused by men in the 1950s while supposedly living the stereotypical picture-perfect American suburban life (if being a tradwife is 100% their personal choice I don't necessarily see the issue, although I am still very concerned). Unfortunately, my post got substantial negative backlash, and for obvious reasons, I decided it was better to delete it.\n\nOne of the users who responded to my post shamed me for comparing what she claimed was an already marginalized community to a dystopian regime, and not respecting people like her. Ironically, she then said that the tradwife subreddit has gone to hell ever since *creepy guys and people with fetishes* started entering the community. Then she made the truly astounding claim that *women being in the home was empowering, and that she was going to submit to her man and pray for me.*\n\nLet that sink in. She said it was *empowering to submit to a man and stay at home,* and complained about creepy men and fetishes *while being part of a community that has fetishized 1950s gender norms and aesthetics, and propagated the idea that a woman should be absolutely dominated by men (or literally OWNED by men, as some users have actually come out and admitted).* The fact such a community has attracted the worst kinds of people is not rocket science-- it is absolutely to be expected, and the community has no one else to blame but itself.\n\nConflating submission (i.e. the opposite of independence and strength) with empowerment is SERIOUS Orwellian doublethink, and I'm honestly at a loss over how to respond to an idea like that. It's bizarre to me that a movement that is against feminism is using the very language of feminism to justify a clear imbalance of power between the sexes.\n\nI don't understand why this movement and why antifeminism even among women has become so popular online in recent years, when it is clearly disempowering to everyone. The consensus for why this is happening, according to my research, seems to be due to several factors, including 1) disillusionment with the feminist movement, 2) the feeling that the feminist movement hasn't truly helped women because of its corporate capture by capitalism (the term \"corporate girlboss feminism gets thrown around a lot, which is seen as a sort of selfish, performative version of feminism), 3) environmental crises and economic crises driving people towards seeking security and familiarity in traditional ways of living, and 4) a desire by many women to be included in the hierarchical power structure of patriarchies, thinking they will somehow benefit by advocating for men who won't hesitate to discard or abuse them once they attain power.\n\nThoughts on this?","title":"The Tradwife community is creepy and disturbing, and I cannot for the life of me understand why it and the antifeminist movement have gained so much traction in recent years.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Feminism\/comments\/1boznwc\/the_tradwife_community_is_creepy_and_disturbing\/"}

We have already started reaching out to some female therapists our age\/younger. Thank you everyone for your kind words and support. \n\nSide note: If anyone has recommendations for someone in NC that would be great. \n\nMy husband read through everyone\u2019s comments and when we talked more he now understands what I was trying to say and that it isn\u2019t that I was trying to keep him from getting recognized for his contributions to our family but rather that it isn\u2019t right in general for only men to get praise for parenting, but even moreso in the context of a marriage counselor for a couple that is intentional about having an equitable distribution of labor in all areas of our relationship. \n******\n\nMy husband and I, both 32, started seeing a couple's therapist, (m, \\~60 yo) about 2 months ago. For some general background, my husband and I have been together since we were 16 and married for 6 years. We have a 3 yo and a 6 month old. We are overall very happy, we are best friends and are committed to breaking generational trauma for ourselves and our kids' sakes. The reason we started seeing a therapist was more of a maintenance\/care thing than for any huge glaring issue.\n\nSo the comment in question was when I was telling our therapist about our overnight routine with the baby. Baby is breastfed so I wake up to nurse him as needed overnight. My husband sleeps while I nurse and then I let him know when I'm done nursing and he does diaper change and puts baby back in his crib. For some context that will be relevant in a bit, I nursed our first for 2 years and my husband didn't do this with him, this is something I asked him to do with this new baby because it seemed more fair than how things were the first time around. \n\nSo, back to me telling the therapist how I hand off baby to husband to change his diaper and get him back to sleep after I nurse him. His jaw dropped and he was offering all kinds of praise to my husband. He then asked me \"have you thanked your husband for how he helps you at night?\" I said I do, and that I'm grateful to have a husband who helps share the load of taking care of our children. Which is true, I am grateful. But the more I think about it the more his comment rubs me the wrong way. Why is it only me that needs to be grateful for my husband's contributions in caring for our baby overnight? I am also waking up and taking care of the baby. How come he didn't ask my husband if he has thanked me for what I do? It just seems so taken for granted when I do it, but when a man helps all of a sudden I need to jump for joy. After therapy, I shared how I feel about this with my husband I really thought he'd agree with me and see how sexist the therapist's reaction was, but he doesn't see it?! He agrees with the therapist and is now mad at me for making it all about me and feels like I'm trying to steal his spotlight. My thing is, we either both deserve praise for the way we take care of our baby overnight or neither of us deserve praise because we're just doing what is our responsibility. But it can't be praise for him, and none for me because I'm just doing what I'm supposed to.\n\nAm I wrong to think our therapist's reaction was rooted in sexism and traditional gender expectations? Does it not highlight the way a woman's contributions to her family are undervalued? It's become an ongoing argument between us, I am starting to feel like it's the therapist and my husband against me since this is not the only comment of this type he's made.","title":"Am I wrong to be annoyed with something our couples therapist said?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Feminism\/comments\/15skvn3\/am_i_wrong_to_be_annoyed_with_something_our\/"}

It must encompass a holistic approach that considers societal expectations beyond employment.\nOften, discussions about women's rights overlook the underlying exploitation and oppression they face in carrying the burden of household responsibilities alongside their careers.\nIn traditional societies,, women are expected to manage households, raise children, and even when they work, these responsibilities remain. Their earned income is often controlled by male family members, making them dual unpaid labors.\nThe vulnerability of women in third world countries, for example, Baloch and Pashtun women, is multifaceted. They face oppression from state, religious extremism, tribalism, and patriarchy, layered and complex.\nRecognizing the intersectionality of oppression and problems faced by women is vital. Their struggles encompass various layers - societal, cultural, religious, and systemic.\nImprovement in women's conditions demands addressing these complex factors.

I love getting nuanced perspectives so please feel free to disagree!\n\nI think that everyone should do whatever they want to but I will never agree with only fans or porn or prostitution. I mean I think so much shit is wrong with porn already but I also think only fans is scummy. People like only fans because they say that the women are the ones getting paid. But guess who owns Only Fans? A man. Guess who makes up the board? Men. They're the ones who end up profiting off of it. Just because a pimp is wearing a tie and has an office doesn't make the concept any different. They just think that since we find sex work liberating now apparently, instead of forcing us to make content they'll just pretend it's at their own will even though when your motivated by money to do something like strip on camera that is prostitution.\n\nAnd also I don't understand why we would support any culture or any society that puts a price on our bodies. It's the same thing with dates where men will pay for dinner and then you're expected to give them sex in return. Or parties where men have to pay to get in but it's free for women. It's because those men are paying to go and meet hot girls and hope to get lucky. I think it's sick. And guess who's collecting money at the door? Oh that's right, dudes. And nothing makes me more disgusted than sick people like belle Delphine who literally have only fans where they dress and act like children. That's literally disgusting. These women are feeding into people's fantasies who are actually sick in the head. Or the \"school girl\" porn. It's literally all sick and I feel like someone had to say it.\n\nThe way that men see it is that if they take a woman on a date and spend enough money she will put out. AKA buying sex but mix in some romance. They literally will subscribe to an only fans and feel like they have that control over people.\n\nAnything that you can buy is an object. You can't legally buy human beings. When we promote the idea that our bodies can be bought by money, or even worse, for some time or attention they are winning. It's not a fuck you to people who slut shamed women in the past and forced them into conservatism, men and corporations like only fans will just disguise the control behind wokeness and we as women just eat it up and they win every fucking time.\n\nEdit: (**Interesting how you can't pay for organs because it's coercion, you can't coerce someone to sign a contract but it's A OK to pay for someones body, pay for media of their body, and coerce them to give you sex.)** It was taking a while to respond individually so I'll just add some more thoughts here. Feminism is the belief that there should be equality among the sexes. So how is it a fundamental of feminism to sell our bodies? How is that promoting equality? If you teach the new generation of women that they have a fall back plan of straight up sex work if they're financially insecure, you are doing us all a disservice. No one is out there teaching men as a general whole that you can post on only fans if you're in bad financial conditions. Prostitution is not a viable plan b. prostitution is the suffering of financially insecure women for horny men willing to pay money for people's bodies. With of course rich men profiting off of it. It's objectification at its finest and affects all of us. The normalization of putting a price tag on women's bodies makes every single one of us targets.\n\n***Edit 3: This reminded me of this lyric from Billie Eilish's What was I made for, from the Barbie Movie, I feel like it was an extended metaphor.***\n\n***\"Looked so alive, turns out I'm not realJust something you paid for.\"***","title":"I don't agree that sex work is part of feminism or that it's liberating","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Feminism\/comments\/1bebq4r\/i_dont_agree_that_sex_work_is_part_of_feminism_or\/"}

(I might try posting there someway, there's a lot of people that need to hear this)\n\nI still enjoy watching shows like *Spy x Family* or Studio Ghibli movies because I like anime. But honestly, I just can\u2019t keep brushing off the extreme sexualization and disturbing content as something \u201ccultural\u201d or something you eventually \u201cget used to.\u201d It\u2019s not okay.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was at the hospital with my girlfriend for one of her therapy sessions. The therapy area was in the same section as pediatrics, and there was a TV showing *Dragon Ball*. I remember casually glancing at it, only to see this completely ridiculous scene where an adolescent girl (or at least that\u2019s how she looked) flashed her chest at an old man. I was just sitting there, flabbergasted, looking at my girlfriend in disbelief.\n\n Then I start thinking of all the completely unethical scenes portraying women \u2014 a sexualized manner (unrealistic body, literally just two balls of meat bouncing at every little thing for the sake of fan service), most of them are minors (and no, saying they are 93291 years old does not make it better), a looooot of rape and non consented sexual scenes, and camera angles in general. \n\nIt\u2019s especially sad because there are so many badass female protagonists in anime who could be inspiring but end up reduced to shallow, stereotypical, and patriarchal tropes. It\u2019s frustrating to see that kind of potential wasted.\n\nAll I'm saying is, I wish anime calmed down a bit on the sexual content. Japan has significant issues with gender equality and respect for women, and anime often reflects those problems (there\u2019s plenty of research on this).\n\n I just want to watch an anime that captures that magical, unique feel anime is known for\u2014without all the sexism.","title":"Why I stopped watching anime.
