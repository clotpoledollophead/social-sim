{"author":"TelevisionKnown8463","body":"I spent my 20s through early 40s believing that having a good man fall in love with me and want to marry me would prove my worth. In my early 20s I kept dating guys who didn\u2019t want to get serious with me and I took it as a negative reflection on myself. I did end up getting married to a guy who I still love as a friend, but I felt his contributions to our relationship and joint household were lacking. For that and other reasons, we ended the relationship after over a decade together.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in your 30s, it becomes much easier to find men who want to get serious quickly. I had plenty of attention and offers, which helped me realize that the way each guy felt, and what he wanted, had little relation to my merit as a person or to how well I treated him.\n\nBy my mid40s I realized that after the initial honeymoon phase of lots of fun sex, I didn\u2019t get much out of these relationships. I didn\u2019t need these guys financially, and they took much more than they gave in terms of logistical and emotional support.\n\nSo I stopped dating, and haven\u2019t been tempted to find another romantic partner. Now that I don\u2019t need them to validate my self-worth, I don\u2019t see much point.","created_utc":1741569739000,"comment_id":"mgvqs0e","parent_id":"t3_1j7bcyf","score":115,"submission_id":"1j7bcyf"}

{"author":"iwasntalwayslikethis","body":"I felt the same way about 90\u2019s and early 2000s romantic comedies; it taught me that certain behaviors are acceptable when they were actually abusive or inappropriate\u2026 And no one told me, \u201cIt\u2019s just a movie; it\u2019s not like that in the real world,\u201d - so similar to your situation with Disney films, I was also raised on movies that taught me poor relationship etiquette as well as incorrect expectations that I later learned were false. And yes, I was very let down because of it for a long time. I learned my feelings of anger, frustration and disappointment were all misguided; I found that I was angry at Hollywood for making such silly, stupid movies. I didn\u2019t learn how to properly behave in a relationship until I met someone patient who helped me learn to communicate appropriately as well as the importance of boundaries and how to set them. I realized there was nothing I could do to go back and change the way I was raised. What\u2019s done is done and I don\u2019t have the energy to be angry and disappointed anymore. It\u2019s just not worth it to me. I have many other things I\u2019d rather invest my energy in than feeling resentment and disappointment. Life has enough of that as it is. Dating is hard and if you\u2019d rather not do it, all the more power to you. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad for where you\u2019re at in your life. You don\u2019t need to have kids and get married to be on the same level as others. Measure your happiness based on how happy you feel rather than comparing it to others.

We can see right through the bullshit of religious men, they can do everything right (treat you well) but the misogyny runs deep in their veins. They never fight for the change or rights of women in their religion, they want the benefits of it all. It's very obvious to us, so the minute we leave our community and religion, we try to overcorrect. We fall in the arms of liberal men because even if they don't externally do the right things for us, they are still miles ahead of the religious men. Until we come to realise after being treated like sex objects, that they too are covert misogynists. From most women, we are the ones who get to see both sides distinctly because of the transition and we really get fed up of men. Men lose their appeal to us. We see it for what it is, a losing game. \n\nPutting all that aside, I still would prefer to live in a non-religious world(secular). Yes they are still mental shackles, but they are there in both the cases. People who haven't had to live in religious households and communities don't realise how bad it gets. Atleast I won't be in a physical cage, I can have my autonomy and a small community.

{"author":"electricpapaya593","body":"This is really.. profoundly negative though. You honestly have to see it the other way around too, how desperate men are, because they're raised the way they are. \"Having to play along and act out this misogynistic role to get laid\". With no emotional intelligence and hardly any emotional internal reflection. Think about that vs how EASY it is to live now, without kids, enjoying your hobbies, plants, pets, goals, art, writing, whatever...\n\nThere are a million directions to send your mind down. Don't get caught up in the thinking-trap that there is only a screwed way to live.\n\nEVERYTHING is in your head. You are what you think. Your perceived circumstances... It all gravitates more towards you if you allow yourself to think a certain way. \/\/They know that and want you to perceive only their hellish trap\/\/ When people think they can fuck with your head they have you exactly where they want you. Realize that a ton of it is just that. Creepy fucking with your head, in attempt to drag you into some kind of crab bucket\n\nActually while I was growing OP I felt exactly like you do, I didn't see the point of what suffocated pickmes around me were doing. No matter how popular they were or good looking they were they always played by these petty rules and the suffocation they lived with was blinding. I did solitude a lot, I didn't see any other choice, but at least I wouldn't have to live with any of that. I never really felt completely ostracized like you're talking about, for being extremely laid back and invested in none of it either though. I was ostracized later but it had nothing to do with those things, it had more to do with getting gangstalked. Eventually that died down a lot and I went back to normal.\n\nSo I aimed to become as \"lazy\" with emotional labor as possible. I don't wear makeup and I know tons of beautiful women who don't wear make up. They have WAY more going for them mentally most of the time, then the desperate kind of women who throw themselves into male-gaze rituals \/ emotional intelligence slave labor rituals. (Common sense is enough)\n\nAt the end of the day all that matters is who is laughing at who. Enjoying your life is the bottom line. So you live to unchain your mind from every lopsided gender expectation possible and throw it in people's faces, if they ever throw it in  yours. You get satisfaction from it if people get angry, you feed off it and live in peaceful harmony anyway because.. Well from what I've learned people are just piranhas about everything a lot of the time. It doesn't matter why... They just live that way a lot for tons of reasons. Like having 16 sticks up your ass is an adorable trait to have and makes you attractive or something...\n\nI did so many things I don't know how to fit into a response to this. This post could be waaaay too long. The bottom line is men WANT you to feel chained, and suffocated miserable and give something to them they feel you owe them. Pick-mes WANT to drag you into the bucket with them so you, live as mentally screwed as they are.\n\nThere is the option to be neither. If you fall into the \"screwed because I don't wear make up\" trap it becomes another hell. Why when you can live so high off of the things you work on? It doesn't matter what other people think, it matters how they perceive your energy. They may ridicule you but when they are honest with themselves they know they're getting strung along \/ chained down for no reason.\n\nOh my god I wish you the very best. You will have a better day for sure! A million happy days to you. I swear you will find them somehow.","created_utc":1626803771000,"comment_id":"h5uwdsq","parent_id":"t3_onk549","score":11,"submission_id":"onk549"}

Shame that even then a guy couldn't think that maybe he was the problem but instead twisted it around and blamed the woman. Maybe he was a bad kisser. Maybe he had bad breath. Maybe he was in a bad mood or being stingy or whatever and she just wasn't into that type of treatment so of course she wouldn't enjoy the kiss.","created_utc":1607487452000,"comment_id":"gf382ka","parent_id":"t3_k91z2t","score":30,"submission_id":"k91z2t"}

I\u2019ve *never* liked men. Even as a child. \n\nI can sometimes like a man as a individual, and I will show respect to men as human beings and peers and even sometimes friends, but the relationships are always going to be very shallow and very limited. It is what it is. I\u2019ve come to accept that relationships with men will *always* have sex as a motivating factor looming under the surface, and how great or not great their desire to have sex with you is 100% what determines how much \u201crespect\u201d they are willing to show you. I honestly just can\u2019t relate to or respect that, and so I keep my distance. Reading the news and hearing story after story about the general awfulness and violence  men feel entitled to enact on other people just solidifies my resolve. \n\nI decided that it was worth prioritizing my own authentic feelings over what society expects of me. I don\u2019t thrive when there is a man in my life because of the expectations that men have that women will happily do all the work and all the emotional and mental labor while men pop in once in a while with a \u201cgrand gesture\u201d like setting up a streaming system with 10,000 options, and then have the right to kick their feet up for the other 364 days of the year. \n\nSince I\u2019ve totally given up on men, I have grown in ways I couldn\u2019t imagine doing if I were constantly taking care of another fully-grown adult human being.

{"author":"CommieLibrul","body":"I\u2019m a 70F scientist and have pretty much been 4B since I got pregnant with my 28 yo daughter, who is now a nurse in a hospital cardio icu. Even before that, I despised men. They were all selfish in bed and always seemed shocked to discover that I had a much higher IQ than they did. I wanted to be a mom and thought I had to endure all of their fuckery to get what I wanted. Once I got pregnant at the advanced age of 41, I wanted nothing further to do with them. I defended my PhD dissertation in front of four disapproving male professors while 7 months pregnant and never looked back. \n\nWhen my daughter was about 5, I befriended a guy at work who was a few years younger than me. We\u2019d talk a lot after work hours, when everyone had gone home. I was always remarking that it seemed like we were basically the same person, just different genders. It helped that we weren\u2019t sexually attracted to each other. It was the first time in my life that I felt what it would\u2019ve been like to have a brother. For whatever reason, we just really hit it off and it was great, until it wasn\u2019t. \n\nIt all fell to shit when I inherited a serious amount of family money. I was raised middle class but my maternal grandfather did well, and so did my dad\u2019s childless brother-in-law. All their money trickled down to me and my two sisters because my parents were quite frugal and had no idea how to spend the money before they died. \n\nWhen this male friend discovered that I\u2019d recently inherited serious money, he became so jealous that he ghosted me.

This is why women who are single and childless live longer and happier than women who are married and with kids.\n\nIt's important for women to understand how all of that isn't worth it but taking the path of being single and grow community with other single women is what can make us happy and fulfilled in this life.","created_utc":1668132849000,"comment_id":"ivug0vz","parent_id":"t3_ynp5ke","score":19,"submission_id":"ynp5ke"}

{"author":"love-starved-beast","body":"Your concerns are valid.  \n  \nThe only pushback I'll give you is what you probably already know: A husband wouldn't care for you in your twilight years anyway, and sons are a crap shoot, so you've lost nothing materially by going your own way.\n\nThat said, we live in a hyper-individualist society that has destroyed much of the community support enjoyed by our ancestors to instead glaze the nuclear family. Without children (daughters) willing to support you, being elderly is rough.\n\nThis is why it's vital for women to strategize for old age while we're still able-bodied, and to build community with one another: Maintain diverse friendships, put money aside, downsize as we age, pick our assisted living\/nursing home early, select our medical proxies, write our wills, even plan for MAID.\n\nThe future doesn't have to be as bleak as you imagine, but you do need to be pragmatic in your approach.","created_utc":1737668317000,"comment_id":"m8pyzt9","parent_id":"t3_1i82jmn","score":238,"submission_id":"1i82jmn"}

{"author":"sofiacarolina","body":"Wow I could\u2019ve written this. I\u2019m also 31 and an only child. I\u2019ll have no family after my mom dies. \n\nThe only diff is I still live with and depend on her bc I\u2019m chronically ill..surprise I got sick with a bunch of illnesses after a lot of trauma at the hands of men (happened in my early 20s - they\u2019re real illnesses, not psychosomatic, but def feel all the abuse I experienced aided in me developing these health issues). I wfh and make nothing. I\u2019ve applied for disability and got rejected, have to apply again later on. I\u2019m mostly bedbound. Im not able bodied and have no friends as a result. I can\u2019t build community when I\u2019m either working or suffering from my physical symptoms in bed. \n\nSo I\u2019m terrified, I\u2019m very terrified. If I had friends and family that I knew I could rely on, I wouldn\u2019t be, but I\u2019m truly alone in this world and idk how to change it bc of very physical material limitations. I talk to people online here and there but that\u2019s not real community that I could rely on irl. I had friends before I got sick - it\u2019s not just men that abandon you when you get sick. \n\nI am very firm in my decision to not have kids or get married, I never wanted that from a young age - I only ever wanted a \u2018life partner\u2019 but I know that will NEVER be found in a man, more like a life drainer.\n\nHowever I have absolutely no idea how I will manage. My only hope is to somehow find a \u2018chosen family\u2019, become best friends with another woman like me, and have that support..but it\u2019s so hard when you can\u2019t go out and most women are paired off and getting married and having kids anyways. Also at this stage in life, it seems everyone already has all the friends they want (bc most people didn\u2019t go through life events that left them isolated and alone), so it\u2019s rare to find someone else who is in that spot. I am not someone most people can relate to or who can relate to most people bc of all the things that have happened to me, so it\u2019s already a small pool, and all other things considered above, even smaller and smaller. I feel doomed, ngl, and that I won\u2019t survive it. None of this makes me ever consider dating a man, btw. But this is my reality and it\u2019s terrifying. \n\nSolitude is not an issue, I\u2019m very used to it and even enjoy it, its peaceful. it\u2019s the managing everyday life alone part that I simply don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to do bc of my health issues.

{"author":"S3lad0n","body":"This is a fair point, and I empathise.\n\nWhile I'm happily 4B\/celibate\/alone and not about to change, still I deeply fear old age as a lone woman, and thinking about it or trying to plan for it makes my depression so much worse. \n\nWatching my grandmother approach 90 and lose her faculties is so difficult and mortifying. I know she wouldn't survive or be in a relatively good comfortable place without all the free daily help\/healthcare she gets from me, my mother, my sister, family money and her late husband's wealth, etc. I'm not going to have any of that privilege to cushion and protect me in old age. \n\nSo my sad hope is that I don't make it to that age and therefore don't have to go through it. Going by my parents' current level of health and mobility and mental sharpness etc., so long as I can make some money and stay off the ledge\/in good nick physically, then I should be somewhat fine until about age 65-69, either alone or with a wife\/caring close friend (though I've never had either before and don't know how to make\/keep one, so...). After that...well.\n\nAnd if I never get a half-decent income going or don't marry a rich woman in the next 10-15 years, then it's so over for me anyway.

On average they have better aim. Their upper body strength means they can far better control recoil and so they are able to be more precise when shooting multiple shots. And shooting for sport is a poor comparison to shooting in a conflict in case anyone brings up women in sports and how they sometimes outcompete men. People also rarely stay still in a conflict too, most men still out compete most women in cardiovascular endurance and speed, especially when you factor in that a lot of guns are heavy, *all the kit is heavy*.

If it is true that males live parasitically upon females, it seems reasonable to suppose that many of them and those loyal to them are in some way sensitive to the parallelism between their situation and that of the fetus. They could easily identify with the fetus. The woman who is free to see the fetus as a parasite might be free to see the man as a parasite. The woman\u2019s willingness to cut off the life line to one parasite suggests a willingness to cut off the life line to another parasite. The woman who is capable (legally, psychologically, physically) of decisively, self-interestedly, independently rejecting the one parasite, is capable of rejecting, with the same decisiveness and independence, the like burden of the other parasite. In the eyes of the other parasite, the image of the wholly self-determined abortion, involving not even a ritual submission to male veto power, is the mirror image of death.  \n>  \n>\u00a0Another clue here is that one line of argument against free and easy abortion is the slippery slope argument that if fetuses are to be freely dispensed with, old people will be next. Old people? Why are old people next? And why the great concern for them? Most old people are women, indeed, and patriarchal loyalists are not generally so solicitous of the welfare of any women. Why old people? Because, I think, in the modem patriarchal divisions of labor, old people too are parasites on women. The anti-abortion folks seem not to worry about wife beating and wife murder-there is no broad or emotional popular support for stopping these violences. They do not worry about murder and involuntary sterilization in prisons, nor murder in war, nor murder by pollution and industrial accidents. Either these are not real to them or they cannot identify with the victims; but anyway, killing in general is not what they oppose. They worry about the rejection *by women, at women\u2019s discretion*, of something which lives parasitically on women. I suspect that they fret not because old people are next, but because men are next.","created_utc":1593555875000,"comment_id":"fwh7dl5","parent_id":"t3_hil748","score":74,"submission_id":"hil748"}

There are several knitters in our family, and my aunt crochets.\n\nI had to stay with my grandparents for awhile a couple of years back after a fire, and I couldn't find *any* knitting supplies in the house other than what I had managed to salvage and bring with me. Eventually I discovered a few balls that were packed away in storage and covered in dust, which makes me think she still wants to knit but is never able to. Also, despite her favorite TV genre being crime, it was never playing as long as my grandpa was awake - only his westerns, 50s sitcoms, and sports games for up to ten hours a day, despite no one else in the house (me, grandma, and my aunt and younger female cousin) liking any of that. She barely had any time for herself when she constantly had to take care of his messes and baby him, and calm him down after his tantrums. And despite him being related to multiple female fiber artists and married to a knitter, he's never even paid enough attention to any of that to know the difference between knitting and crocheting.\n\nAlso, they've missed a total of six of my birthdays and almost missed my college graduation dinner because he would throw a fit about me picking \"foreign foods\" and even tried to insist that my graduation dinner be changed to his favorite restaurant that I don't even like. Also, during my commencement ceremony, when everyone was quarantined in their cars because of covid and the only way to hear any announcements or speeches was by listening to a specific radio station, he tried to change the station so he could listen to his music.

Had to force myself to take on tasks he used to do or pay for help. It's hard but I'm doing it. I'm grateful that my cancer spread is on hold due to treatment so I am relatively functional physically. Two of my 3 children are my biggest support along with friends.

Not as a this will learn them, but in the most basic don't drink from the poisoned well concept. The way I have been told I was blaming women, punishing women blah blah blah...so all these women suddenly running and confessing they are 4b has me just giving them the side eye. They are still thinking it's a game, and they think that not sleeping with men will magically make them turn around, and suddenly, everything will be fixed. This tells me they really don't get it. You should stop sleeping with men because allowing any men in your life drastically reduces your quality of life, your peace, affects your health.. so much so that it can kill you. It's not this high school game that if I don't sleep with him, he will do what I want. Because it won't happen, I can tell you that. To them, you are not a full human being. Not sleeping with them won't change that. To them, it's like a horse they have in the house suddenly not wanting to be ridden...they will of course, teach that horse that they will be ridden.. They will....break that horse until it submits. Until they understand that, we haven't even started addressing the problem. Men don't need to be educated. They must be abandoned.

{"author":"psycorah__","body":"Performative af tbh. I give it to the end of the year until it dies down. If more women were actually serious about it they'd only address other women & start focusing on the work towards achieving this lifestyle. They'd be candid about the threat posed and there would be no forgivement (because seriously it's been the same thing for centuries now), there also wouldn't be 4B content aimed towards men like it's a bargaining chip. As someone mentioned this will not change men they'll just see it as a challenge so any woman serious about this needs to realise 4B not a game, it's resistance because this is war.\n\nThe fact that women with partners are trying to get in on it & many other \"4B\" women are supporting this says it all. I stopped dating last decade & I didn't make a show of it. I put my head down & got to work. Several other women who've been in the game longterm have done the same. Long story short I dont think it's serious or most women have the grit for this life & all it entails tbh. Even in SK where the movement originated it's not that big in real life & is being used as a scapegoat for the economic issues that country has.

{"author":"DworkinFTW","body":"The 4B sub is booming because the term is trending. So you\u2019re getting a lot of people who don\u2019t understand what it is.\n\nIt is not a \u201csex strike\u201d, akin to a work strike. I am in support of a \u201csex strike\u201d, but I think it\u2019s disingenuous to call yourself 4B or separatist when you\u2019re not actually separatist. 4B\/separatism is more akin to quitting\ncorporate America altogether, than a strike.\n\nI also don\u2019t love that women are announcing their plans to separate as an FU to men. It just gets them laughed at and derided and not taken seriously. Plus that\u2019s more emotional labor to take on. The point of separatism is less emotional labor surrounding men, not more. You don\u2019t have to announce it. You can just start living that way. \n\nI think it\u2019s good to talk about so that other women feel disenfranchised know who they can turn to, so community can be formed. So they know this other path exists. But I think it\u2019s pointless to try to punish men with it. In classic female projection fashion, what these women don\u2019t get is that in the way that we avoid negative male attention, men don\u2019t feel that way about us, because they don\u2019t feel threatened by it the way we do. They would prefer positive female attention to be sure, but negative attention- for them- is better than none at all. \n\nSo if you really wanted to \u201churt\u201d them (again, not the point of separatism but, maybe you can make a case for it in a strike), the best thing is not to nag and beg and \u201cin your FACE, hole digger hahahaha!\u201d. The best thing is to stoically, unemotionally ignore them. Basically like, here are our terms, we\u2019re on strike until they\u2019re met, think it over, we will be over there, not having sex with you. And then go grey rock and ignore them until the terms are met. There is nothing that pains a man more than being ignored and not thought of by women (and I think they also respect it more, than high key emotion).\n\nBut with this misunderstanding of 4B, you have 1) women wanting to call themselves 4B when they\u2019re not separatist. You can\u2019t \u201cdo 4B with husband\u201d. It\u2019s kind of a slap in the face to the women who actually are separatists and have relinquished the social privileges of engaging with men on a personal level. and 2) not understanding that while a strike is one thing, separatism is another, and it\u2019s not intended to punish or \u201cget men to change\u201d. It\u2019s for the self. It\u2019s discovering who you are independent of the partner label, of behavior that exists to please men. It\u2019s forming community with other women, to the exclusion of male voices.\n\nYou all know all this already. But the women jumping on the TikTok trend don\u2019t, and soon enough they\u2019ll be saying (well, they already are) separatists are mean spirited and elitist for saying she\u2019s not 4B, and because they said no when this newly self-proclaimed 4B wants to bring her Nigel to the meeting.\n\nOpportunity for female only spaces and lifestyles are so so important, and I do worry about them being erased as the masses become aware of them, determined to change their nature so these women can have their cake and eat it too. Most women cannot separate. And that\u2019s ok! But I think it\u2019s important to preserve movements, spaces, and lifestyles of women who are doing that, keep that clear delineation. Much like veganism or alcohol sobriety, a woman can support a lifestyle without feeling the need to co-opt it to reap the title for clout, without doing the hard parts.\n\nETA: This is not to say I see no silver lining, ie growing awareness of separatism, and decentering men as a valid, supported, lifestyle choice, even if it\u2019s on a spectrum. Some progress is better than none. I just think there needs to be awareness of the aforementioned issues.","created_utc":1731197900000,"comment_id":"lw9mlpm","parent_id":"t3_1gn44x4","score":31,"submission_id":"1gn44x4"}

If you are gender critical, you may want to take the mantle in your own city while you still can.\u00a0\n\nThis exact question was asked in the r\/4bmovement subreddit.

Let us not please play right into the misogynists hands by hating women for doing the best they can in this fucked up society. I have no respect for people like you, who instead of hating the system that conditions women to behave this way to turn to hating the victims. That is some fucked up shit right there.","created_utc":1692409695000,"comment_id":"jwr0y26","parent_id":"t3_15ums5h","score":57,"submission_id":"15ums5h"}

And then in season 2 the show was canceled pretty much as soon as Bea and Ava actually kissed. \n\nFaking It also tried this with Amy and whatshisface, she was a lesbian in season 1 but after that she had drunk sex with Liam (like they were both about equally drunk and couldn't remember it) while she was upset over Karma, and immediately started questioning her sexuality after that. Like you were drunk honey it's not that deep. So she falls for some bland boring looking guy and tries to date him for awhile but refuses to call herself bisexual, instead claiming that labels are overly restrictive which is also a common lesbophobic trope (and on top of that the only prominent character who was *actually* a lesbian was both biphobic and was 19 dating a 16 yo). Amy did end up with a girl at the end of the series but that boyfriend of hers was so cringe.\n\nOther examples are Steven Universe with Rose and Pearl, The 100 with Clarke and Lexa (and that was also a Bury Your Gays trope as well), and others I'm probably forgetting.","created_utc":1702086826000,"comment_id":"kcj08y9","parent_id":"t1_kbi500x","score":3,"submission_id":"187vd79"}

(I can't comment on lesbian relationships). \n\nMen generally seem to be interested in one-sided relationships that are about cook, clean, fuck.  In all of the romantic relationships that I've been in with men, none of them could handle my intelligence, need for a fair amount of space, drive in my career, and chronic illness.  The latter is especially true; none of them could give support other than \"Go to the doctor\" and \"Why are you still sick?\"  But fuck us if we have the same response for them! \n\nWomen are constantly told that they \"have it all\" once they \"balance\" career with \"family.\"  But the truth is that they can't possibly \"have it all;\" they just get shouldered with the emotional and financial burdens of the family.  Once they get pregnant, their careers are generally (but not always) over, so they have to rely on their husbands not to fuck other women and remain the breadwinners.  Meanwhile, their own emotional and\/or physical health often gets sidelined (or outright dismissed), hence why they age at a quicker rate than single women do.  I mean, shit, look at all of the postpartum injuries, cardiovascular, and cancer diagnoses! \n\nSo despite all of this, why do women crave relationships?  Because they're taught from childhood that too much independence makes her a \"career woman,\" cold, bitchy, lesbian, blah, blah, blah.  They think they'll be the *exception* instead of a number. \n\n (Please note: I don't think there's anything wrong with being LGBT+; I'm using it as an example of an \"insult\" by misogynists.).","created_utc":1615714971000,"comment_id":"gquvqut","parent_id":"t3_m4k69x","score":97,"submission_id":"m4k69x"}

I always mention there's skinny women who never work out and eat crap. So according to their arguments, they shouldn't date those women neither! They don't take care of their health. I also mentioned I work out regularly and pay attention to what I eat but I am not skinny probably because I have a thyroid problem that makes my metabolism slow. Some dudes first actually tried to imply I was lying and didn't really have a thyroid issue, was just using that as an excuse and then when I stated I did have a medical diagnosis for a long time now including blood work, they were like \"oh thats not an excuse you can still be skinny\". Then a girl came in and said she had a thyroid issue as well and the only way she was skinny was because she only had one meal a day which was yogurt with granola. The entire day she only ate that... She said she had tried other diets but she never managed to lose weight. So basically she had to starve herself.\n\nSo all those guys pretending they don't date fat women because of health would date someone who clearly has an unhealthy diet?

And why is so \u201cadorable\u201d and \u201ccute\u201d that they put up with these (at best) bumbling, stupid oaf troll men or at worst, verbally and physically abusive men but it\u2019s romantic because tHaT\u2019s ThE oNlY wAy hE kNoWS tO sHoW lOvE. \n\nI feel like I have to hold back to be fun to watch movies and shows with, because I almost never like the characters or I have a problem with how media looooves to depict graphic sexual violence and exploitation of women as \u201ccharacter development\u201d or \u201cplot\u201d. \n\nMy friends have been super into watching kdramas, and so many of the male archetypes are utter trash. And the men are so STUPID in Romcoms. Why should I have sympathy for the man that was so incompetent he didn\u2019t know to communicate\/was selfish\/cheated\/didn\u2019t know how to express himself... they act like men are the only ones with character depth and trauma. A woman\u2019s trauma is only ever sexual; she was born being perfectly compassionate and communicative and empathetic and human, right? It\u2019s not like she had to learn or that she also has human fears, experiences, and hang ups. No, only men are that sensitive. Poor babies. \n\nSo if anyone has any recommendations that won\u2019t make me gag or take an aspirin or stick my head down the garbage disposal, please send them my way.\n\nEdit: I feel like it should be said that I\u2019ve seen some favourable representations of women and men in media, and there is some great content out there.

{"author":"Tired-Thyroid","body":"Even if romantic love *was* superior and you *were* still interested in finding it, 3 years isn't a long time to be single at all, let alone something that requires an entire intervention. I can't believe they had spent that much time thinking about your love life that they organized it, it sounds absolutely bonkers to me. People in general seem to be obsessed with others not jumping into new relationships after having been single for more than a year, as if that's some established deadline. \n\nLike other comments have mentioned, they are absolutely projecting their own issues onto you. I've seen over the years how hard it is for people to see someone be happy with themselves and by themselves. Women usually lack self-love and rely on men to validate them and elevate their social status. They have internalised our society's lies that single women are at the bottom of the pecking order. They think every woman feels the same, and aren't capable of doing the work to release themselves from this brainwashed mindset. It's easier for them to convince their fellow women to stay miserable with them. \n\nUgh, I remember when I was young and naive and full of self-loathing, I thought all I needed was a boyfriend to be happy. Especially after having depressing experiences with them when I felt discarded, I wasted years pining for that new romance that someone better could bring. It was almost like craving a drug and needing a fix. No one told me I could be happy by myself, like it wasn't even an option and the possibility wasn't discussed anywhere. Historical women who had never married were just painted as witches and crows. Even the resources that did mention working on improving my self-perception only did so because it would mean I could have an easier time finding a man. It was never focused on self-love being the end goal, the end goal was still a man! Now when I've done the work and left the cage I was in, it honestly infuriates me when I start thinking about how literally everything revolves around men and love and sex. I just want to exist and do my hobbies and expand my horizons and learn as much as I can about the world and my own self. Many women don't even know who they are, they only see themselves in relation to their boyfriend or husband. I don't want to waste the only life I get to have on some man. That would truly feel like settling and I know I'd regret it on my deathbed.","created_utc":1677339217000,"comment_id":"j9xjwdp","parent_id":"t3_11b1zfi","score":32,"submission_id":"11b1zfi"}

I don\u2019t say this lightly and it\u2019s taken me years to understand myself enough to say regardless of how strong willed and stubborn we seem to females it\u2019s not power we seek or holding you down or anything malicious. It\u2019s a privilege and a honor to take the burden off the women that we love and cherish more than ourselves by far. There is nothing more beautiful than being a father and a husband other than being a father and husband to a woman who respects his commitment and values his way of showing that love beauty fades and money is an illusion of happiness.. I could never express it enough no matter how hard I tried but the truth is in the end we all loose our chance of heaven\/ complete peace\/ unconditional love.. whatever you choose to call it is unique to you but when you go through enough hell and your soul is no longer satisfied with our attempt to appease it and our blinders turn off and all we have is truth it\u2019s usually to late in life..","created_utc":1691323001000,"comment_id":"juzloq3","parent_id":"t3_14tc7ao","score":2,"submission_id":"14tc7ao"}

{"author":"morgause799","body":"I had weight loss surgery about 18 months ago, went down 50kg (roughly 100lbs). I dress exactly the same as I did before because I'm 40 and I didn't have surgery to get hot (actually, I had surgery to get doctors off from my back, because I was ok with my weight and my body, but don't tell them), but I bought smaller clothes so the older ones wouldn't just fall from my hips. Some people say they were better treated after losing weight, I say people treat me now the same as they did before - with the exception of people who knew me before surgery, those ones are the worst. They tell me \"omg you lost SO MUCH weight\", \"you look so great NOW\", \"why didn't you have surgery SOONER?\", like, I didn't like your appearance and you should have done something about it ages ago. \n\nSince strange people didn't give a shit about my appearance, and I lost weight therefore I don't have my full moon face anymore, I gathered courage to do something I had always wanted to do: buzz my hair. I've always said that I'd do it if I were a black woman with a fierce, strong face, but the truth is I'm whiter than an LED lamp, while not as bright, a buzzcut wouldn't do my basic face any favors. But I did it anyway. I love it!! People around me, not so much. I had 3 people asking if I'm undergoing cancer treatment in less than a week. I'm not looking at men or looking for a relationship, but they're looking at me, and they dislike that I don't cater to them. Women like that are dangerous. Yesterday I was at the food court of a mall and I took a little time to observe people looking at me. Some women were curious or confused, other were amused. Men were disgusted. Some gay men nodded and went their way. Even though I was wearing a dress (it's spring here), they were having a hard time deciding on a label to put on me. We are hated because they don't know how to act towards a woman, let alone towards one who couldn't care less if they like her or not.

I never felt so liberated no longer having to concern myself with trying to please the opposite gender. It's too draining when they have impossible standards for women. For instance. Men body shaming women and the body dysmorphia I now have as a result.. I can think of so many situations of dating life past. I don't even know where to begin, because even thinking of dating I get intense anxiety from all the traumas accumulated over the years. Cannot believe I allowed myself to suffer so long before going single. It's liberating not to care anymore tho i still get that urge. Then I think of the shaming and potential pregnancy scares...I'm like, nah, not worth it... should have done this much earlier.

It's a casual relationship based on fun and not drama. I'm not saying that some don't end up long-term or bring drama, but that often isn't the goal.\n\nWe've all been (or are) young women so we know that a traditional relationship can bring drama, games and hurt feelings, etc. Why? Usually, one person wants more of something from the other that the other isn't willing to give.\n\nAs for older men\/older women relationships, I think some men avoid a relationship with older women their age because we are more mature than younger women and less likely to take any drama, etc. We know what we want and what we don't want. We are independent and have higher expectations and don't have to compromise our values, etc. if we don't want to. \n\nAs for me, I want neither a younger partner, partner my age or older partner.

{"author":"-badmadAM","body":"Thank you so much for doing this and thinking of your daughter first! I wished my mum would have been like this. \n\nAlso people need to be aware that fathers can even be detrimental for the daughters if they are loving, caring and non- abusive, they especially hinder a daughters mental developpment and self- confidence in certain areas. How? Fathers consistently underestimate the capabilities of their female children (erp for example intellectual capabilities) and overestimate those of their sons. Also studies show that fathers find screaming children more annoying\/ worse if they think it is a female child... And for children and their self- image the perception of them by those close to them is more important than any other real- life feedback or even than any of the child's real success and achievements. There is a reason why daughters of single fathers tend to be in the lowest IQ- range of all family types. Think about that, this is sad. I thought of doing a whole post about it (would need to sort my sources and all) but maybe this is not the right sub for it, idk.\n\n I believe there might be some emotional disadvantages as well, as girls with \"loving\" fathers (a lot that I know) also tend to be very male- centric and always tend to seek that special male- validation, be it because they think all males are as great or because they did not quite get all they needed emotionally, while they still were loved, and are now always on the look out for this mysterious missing piece subconsciously.

{"author":"Seraphina_Renaldi","body":"I feel you. When I was a teenager I was definitely not a Margot Robbie and far from conventional beautiful. I was bullied by guys for years for being ugly. By my classmates, random guys that passed me by on the street just yelled \u201eugly\u201c at me and so on. Anyway I also had a phase where I felt like I should have been born a male, because then my life would be much easier. It also didn\u2019t help that my dad is pretty misogynistic. At the age of 15 I tried to learn how to use make-up and a few years later I wasn\u2019t one of those ugly girls anymore. I\u2019m also a natural brunette and bleached my hair for years. I really like blonde hair, but I also knew how unhealthy it would be for my hair and how much I would destroy them, but I did it anyway. I got much male attention, also much unwanted male attention like thinking being friends with a guy for years just for him to tell you that he wanked to your photos or trying to act like a friend, just because he wanted to have sex with you. I was also veeeery insecure about my body. For a long time I didn\u2019t want to have boobs, because I kinda understand back then how disgustingly women are treated with visible boobs. My wish was granted to a degree, just for me to realize that not having boobs will make you marginalized as a woman. So I\u2019m not really petite, but have tiny boobs. I\u2019m also suffering from lipedema since I\u2019m 14\/15 and didn\u2019t know about it, I just knew that I was fat so I did really bad diets and my lowest weight was 47kg (103,6lbs according to google) while I\u2019m about 1,69m (5,54ft). This was by the way the time when men and also my ex boyfriend found me the hottest. I was constantly tired, had headache, horrible iron deficiency and whatsoever. Btw didn\u2019t hear one man complaining about body positivity, because that\u2019s unhealthy. I drowned in compliments and attention. I still felt disgusting and fat, because I didn\u2019t have veneers straight teeth, could accept my tiny boobs, because now at least they fitted my body proportions, still had visible cellulitis when standing up because of my lipedema even though my xs pants were already loose and I couldn\u2019t wear something shorter than knee length. I was deeply unhappy and always found something to hate myself for. It took me till the end of my 20s to realized how much it took a toll on my mental health, because I could look like a men\u2019s wet dream even though I didn\u2019t even wanted to be sexualized. I just didn\u2019t want to be treated like shit, bullied, not getting jobs, being treated worse by my male teachers and professors simply because they might have not find me attractive. I didn\u2019t understand it, this was more a survival instinct. Now I\u2019m back to my healthy weigh, I decided to let my natural hair grow out. I still don\u2019t let myself go and look like slob. I just don\u2019t care about the male gaze. I know that I will have it worse, especially when I\u2019m back to being a full brunette without blonde balayage, but I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m tired of not being seen as a human, but a breathing fleshlight that has to look pretty. I\u2019m tired of my worth as a human being being tied to how young and beautiful I am. I think the whole Incel talk about being past the prime after 25 also helped me realized that I can try being as beautiful as I want, I\u2019m too old to compete with 19 years old and will be seeing as less anyway so I just can let it go completely.","created_utc":1697700527000,"comment_id":"k5h2wiu","parent_id":"t3_1798sh5","score":5,"submission_id":"1798sh5"}

{"author":"Tired-Thyroid","body":"Yes, the vagina has a sexual purpose from a biological point of view, which is partly why I struggled with accepting it. I knew when I was 4 that I never wanted children, so I automatically rejected that part of me because all I ever heard was how it was for sex and babies. I wouldn't say the penis is on the same level as it also serves for urination the way it's built, but the vagina is completely separate, so I thought it really \"shouldn't have been there\" for me. \n\nThe breasts, to me, were sexual in a way that they were mostly meant to feed babies, and babies can only come from having sex, if you see my point (I now know they have other functions such as storing hormones and iodine, but they may not be the *primary* functions).\n\nThe butt I mentioned because there's constant talk of anal, and even before that was widespread, it was always eroticized or pornified, and definitely came into play during most sexual encounters. It feels different than other parts when someone sees it or touches it, and most people on this planet cover it. I even heard women say \"oh he has a good butt\", so there's definitely something that sparks a sexual interest there. I agree our mouths are also sexualized, but not quite the same extreme way way our butts are.\n\nI know men will still sexualize us, unfortunately, but what I wanted to say was that I've been able to separate myself from that. I don't see myself through their eyes anymore. I don't internalize their depraved thought processes. I wish I could live away from men, I definitely think my healing would speed up; but it is what it is for now, and I'm glad I've at least been able to mentally separate from them if I'm unable to do so physically.","created_utc":1697560656000,"comment_id":"k58f109","parent_id":"t1_k55nbm6","score":6,"submission_id":"1798sh5"}

Your life won't necessarily get better but for many it does.","created_utc":1604377895000,"comment_id":"gaxln6s","parent_id":"t3_jmuu8y","score":18,"submission_id":"jmuu8y"}

Now, it simply means dowdy and old. Women used to try to look older by plucking their hairline back and powdering their hair. \n\nThe best thing to do is simply be yourself and find your style outside of patriarchal expectations.

A lot of that school was centered about love, couples and marriage, some girls were even obsessively thinking about weddings, not just for themselves, but for everyone else too, so when I told them I don\u2019t wanna get married, they literally *glitched* and started telling me that I *should* want to get married, and that I need to have a husband. Now a lot of them were also getting married shortly after we finished high school and still are getting married\/engaged (I\u2019m in my 20s) as if that\u2019s the big goal they\u2019re hoping to achieve and they can \u201cfinally\u201d tick it off the list.\n\n Okay this formulation might seem like I\u2019m trying to be \u201cnot like other girls\u201d or what.

Their generation is far from perfect and I don\u2019t agree with a lot of it, but they didn\u2019t paint some rosy picture or set us up for some lofty expectations, either.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, how do you feel about your best friend?","created_utc":1608786234000,"comment_id":"ggu05bh","parent_id":"t1_ggsxzza","score":5,"submission_id":"kisc0q"}

Not many people are worth my time if I'm honest, I often find myself annoyed with their views and stagnancy. I haven't met many women I've been compatible with, unfortunately. I have some meaningful things in common with some, but then they wear crazy amounts of makeup and suffer daily in high heels, or talk about dating, and I just have a very hard time calling them true friends because of that as it goes so strongly against my own views. It's very limiting, but it is what it is I guess.

Maybe they don\u2019t care as much about a certain cause like you do, maybe they aren\u2019t as radical as you would like, maybe they are too radical, maybe they\u2019re the right amount of feminist but they don\u2019t match your political wavelength\u2014 the differences are endless. \n\nI just check for who is nice, generous, and I have a good time with.

Even the 1% that I have commonalities with fail in a major way when it comes to values and men, so being able to develop deep connections with people is next to impossible. \n\nIf I'm honest, most people annoy me. Especially Women. Every woman I've met so far and tried building a connection with is either man centered, child centered, has low self-esteem, no concern or interest in therapy or personal development, so I can't and won't be bothered. Thankfully, I was blessed with introversion, so it isn't a painful existence, but I'd love a small core group of friends that just GET me. My standards are high, and I'm too particular to waste time in friendships with people who just...exist. \n\nIt's rare to find heterosexual women who have decentered men completely that AREN'T doing it due to trauma. And trust me, those women are not fun to be around (no offense). I'm not saying their anger isn't warranted, but THERAPY is the answer, not abandoning dating due to unresolved pain. I stopped caring about dating and marriage a long time ago because of what men ARE, not years of trauma and poor dating choices, and that seems to be the type I keep running into. \n\nI think I'd have better luck befriending only lesbians at this point.","created_utc":1698278349000,"comment_id":"k6eqywb","parent_id":"t3_17fgjky","score":4,"submission_id":"17fgjky"}

It\u2019s just not me, again maybe I just haven\u2019t found the one, but yeah. I used to feel bad about it, but that\u2019s who I am, I\u2019m an adventurous, independent and goofy person.. \n\nIn all fairness though I felt like I was only in a relationship because I\u2019m tired of people making me feel weird and asking \u201cwhere\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d Not because I actually wanted to be in a relationship with any of the guys, I\u2019ve yet to meet anyone that I\u2019m like \u201cwow, I want to be in a relationship with you\u201d.

I am sorry about the situation with that couple, sounds like a bunch of assholes. Is that the only relationship you had? And do you usually do hookups or something or you don't feel the need to have sex? \n\nI wanted (want?) to be in a relationship because I want to feel like someone has my back and cares about me. My family is a bunch of selfish people with mental illness who don't give a fuck about me and I don't have that many friends because I learned growing up that friends will always leave you for their families\/bfs, you'll never be a priority. So having someone to which I am the priority would be good.\n\nBut that doesn't exist really, not for me at least. And maybe it's my \"fault\" because I grew so independent I don't really have a place to be dependent on someone else.

There was this trend during the 90s where pictures of women bodybuilders were shared and subsequently shamed as unattractive. People encouraged women to stick to cardio. If you lift, even trainers would expect you to lift lighter. The reality is, to build up muscles like a woman bodybuilder you'd need a very specific diet and hours at the gym. Most of us lifting at the gym would just get a toned defined body and a better metabolism.","created_utc":1696119258000,"comment_id":"k2vnugz","parent_id":"t3_16s88jz","score":2,"submission_id":"16s88jz"}
{"author":"Tired-Thyroid","body":"Beauty standards are definitely at play here. A few years ago, there was a huge shift to bubble butts and \"slim-thick\" physiques to appear sexy, and I noticed a lot more women started going to the gym only to achieve that. The gym I go to even added more equipment and classes specifically for butts, and I've never seen men use those. At the same time, a specific type of gym outfit became popular - tights with ruched seams that emphasise the butt, and a tiny top. Along with posing a certain way after your session for social media that also highlights the butt.\n\nOf course, butt exercises are important. And it's still better for women to do them instead of staying out of the gym. But I rarely see them working on their arms with the same intensity and having goals of achieving huge shoulders, for example. Aesthetics matter, too, of course, but for women they always seem to come from a toxic place.","created_utc":1695739294000,"comment_id":"k291bip","parent_id":"t1_k287scw","score":28,"submission_id":"16s88jz"}

{"author":"DejaBlue_Chump","body":"I got divorced three years ago.  Not having children made it easier to extricate myself from the marriage and not comingling finances for major purchases made a definitive split possible.\n\nTowards the end of the marriage, I discovered that he'd been irresponsible with money and had basically spent every penny he was able to get his hands on.  Since then, I've been working hard to recalibrate my finances, and have built up a level of security I never had during the entire marriage, even though there were technically two earners in the household!  In another three years I should be back on track for long term goals like retirement.  There is absolutely no way I will ever risk my financial future for a man ever again.\n\nOne other note: I love to watch those \"tiny home\" videos on youtube, and I started to notice that many of the owners are retirement aged women who had lost 'everything' in a divorce; sometimes through multiple divorces.  Now, I think intentionally wanting to live tiny is totally fine, and I am thinking about it as a possibility for my own future, but  I took it as a warning too.  Money means having more options, and if you've hitched yourself to a bad partner, your future may include less of the options you desire.","created_utc":1663467629000,"comment_id":"iotr1at","parent_id":"t3_x2jtqn","score":11,"submission_id":"x2jtqn"}

{"author":"Hmtnsw","body":"Girl. I feel you. I sometimes think I'm going to have pre-mid life crisis when I think back on the past of what Is love to change but know I made certain decisions based off putting what my parents wanted for me and putting a man before myself. I'm currently going to therapy so I won't a damn mental breakdown. \n\nI hate being a woman and I like it at the same time. I do think life would be easier being a man minus the \"Shut up and quit your whining\"- essentially not being able to be as openly emotional as I am now because \"men don't cry.\" \"Start being soft like a woman.\" Which is just SO toxic. I believe though that it is a small trade off because I can count all the pros of being a man..\n\nI like being fem. I'm too tomboy personality wise to be hyper fem. You will be looked at regardless of how you dress. Like women that wear Burqas, are still at risk of being raped or drawing attention. So I think making yourself \"less attractive\" really isn't going to do anything other than make you higher profile possibly getting murdered or bullied. You can't win either way. Ridiculous. I want to be \"superficially sexy\" for myself because it is a goal I was close to and then gained a bunch of weight because again... putting others before myself.... and that just depresses me. I want to be strong but also wear cute rompers and modest boho. I think that is because I tried too much being \"one of the guys\" growing up because I had a lot of males in my family- even the younger members my age and didn't like being made fun of for \"being a girl\/being into 'girl's things.\" I want to embrace that now. \n\nI really try not to dwell on the past too much as it is toxic. I try to focus on doing more self discovery and molding who I want to become and what I want out of life for myself. \n\nI do enjoy PIV sex (when it is good) but I hate having to deal with finding a not trash man, time and effort and then finding out if his sexual performance tops others I've considered good enjoyable. But I feel safer voluntarily celibate. I literally woke up this morning (like an hour ago) and thought of how nice it was just me and my cat and not having to worry about any of the risks being sexual activity could bring or dealing with someone else period.\n\nTl;dr \nI talk about my issues too and what I think being a man would be like. I talk about wanting to be a fem tomboy and how my childhood had an affect on me. Talk about focusing on myself and how I enjoy PIV sex but I actually find choosing to be celibate and alone much more satisfying.","created_utc":1606691262000,"comment_id":"ge1gz2u","parent_id":"t3_k38yu0","score":13,"submission_id":"k38yu0"}

What causes it is often molded by society and genetic matches that have nothing to do with what we truly want, and makes relationships confusing as we are trying to \"trust our hearts\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI highly recommend Come As You Are to any who haven't read it, as Nagoski explains in detail the formation of relationships as perceived by our biology and culture, and helps to pick those feelings apart.","created_utc":1729739896000,"comment_id":"lte2452","parent_id":"t3_1gaf1jw","score":24,"submission_id":"1gaf1jw"}

I think that leaders who find their populations falling don't necessarily care that it's a social issue, but rather that, from a top-level government perspective, it's a matter of national security first (smaller population being less able to defend itself against larger nations), and second a matter of losing workers, and therefore the risk of not having enough human capital to provide necessary infrastructure such as food and manufacturing. \n\nI am given to understand that Japan's birth rate has fallen in a similar fashion.

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"Honestly I don't believe it's a good approach to obssess about avoiding men. This is like when you are on a diet to lose weight and obsess about food and calories. You just end up being more hungry because you're always thinking about food, and it's harder to eat healthier. \n\nJust leave them be and exist. As long as they don't invade your personal space, who cares. If they do, then you set boundaries and throw them out. \n\nI like to go out to events and travel and I work in IT and I am also looking to invest. So guess what, all of those worlds are male dominated. Men are more likely to travel alone, they're more interested in investment, and at least where I am, men go out more than women (women mostly go on groups of friend). So I cross paths with many men. It's fine, I don't need to let them close if I don't want to. I can just have a normal converstation about those topics and then go on with my life. Personally I only have problems with men when I get romantically involved with them so as long as I avoid that, it's ok.","created_utc":1651956108000,"comment_id":"i7o6c9y","parent_id":"t3_uirt4p","score":5,"submission_id":"uirt4p"}

He had never met me and didn't even know if I was a real person or not. And when I asked him straight away \"Are you still willing to meet up if I don't have sex with you or you just want to exploit a girl in need of housing\"(i was planning on visiting a new city and was looking to meet people there) he got offended.What irks me abt so called nice guys, is that they get offended if you suspect that they only want you for sex, but then, automatically assume you'll have sex with them if you accept to go on a date with them, even though the topic of consent has never been brought up. Some people think that verbal consent is ludicrous and that it kiLLs thE MoOD but me agreeing to have a drink with someone is NOT the same as me consenting to have sex with that person.  \nMind you, that same guy had the audacity to say that he was against the idea of men having to pay for dinner in exchange for sex.lol Paying for dinner is the LEAST men can do to mitigate the risks that women take by having sex with them: risk of pregnancy, STDs, women pay for birth control. If you go on a date you have to pay for the makeup. You have to shave if you're gonna have sex (generally, I'm not saying it's mandatory). And women who engage in sex w men are less likely than any other group to have an orgasm or an enjoyable experience. Not to mention the risks of sexual violence.

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"Yeah right... they want a \"connection\". \n\nLast guy I liked said he didn't like polyamour, and had ended his last previous relationship because it was too much about sex. He said he wanted to be alone in a commune where he bought land and just mind his business. He said he could live without sex and just liked the cuddles really. He didn't demand nudes or other type of pictures, or didn't have inconvenient sexual chats. So I felt confortable with him. I knew I couldn't meet him in the next couple of months because I was recovering from a broken foot and couldn't go anywhere and then pandemic restrictions kicked in again and when I got better, the few days when I could go somewhere (weekends, because I work weeks) we had circulation restrictions. But i was planning to meet when I could walk and restrictions were lifted. I didn't chat with anyone else, didn't really have to. I didn't have a fwb or sex with anyone else. I was just focusing on recovering from my lesion, working, studying, doing my stuff and excited I'd meet someone like minded and maybe travel together in the summer.\n\nThat is of course until a lady stayed there in the commune with him. He told me about her, but he had told me about other women there (the other woman had a kid and a dog.. guess I should have guessed a woman with a kid is too much responsability for a guy like this) so I didn't think much of it I thought they were friends or just neighboors. Then he told me \"as you might have guessed I got romantically involved with X\"... He only told me this after she got upset with him and left him, didn't tell me while he was romantically and sexually involved with her and during that period kept chatting with me and we kept our meeting plans. In his defense, he told her he was planning to meet me, so everyone was okay with the arrangements he was making for me, except me, but who cares about me right? lol \n\nSo here's a guy who is not into polyamour, but doesn't hesitate me to drag me into a shitty love triangle even knowing I was completely against that and had past traumas with my exes leaving for exes. A guy who wasn't that much into sex, but who said to me \"well we weren't dating I am entitled to have my experiences\" (true but then don't pretend you are an evolved creature who can live without sex). He also said I should have been happy for him, proposed to tell me the sexual stuff he did with her, and that he was planning to keep meet her for cacao festivals (the fuck is even that). Also something about healing his past traumas and the girl also had past traumas, so you see it wasn't sex, it was healing past traumas because he was too divine for sex. \n\nWhen I told him to fuck off he said I had a conservative view on relationship and he was more progressive, I thought relationships were transactional and I was selfish and narcisisitic. Then he stalked my reddit posts with a throwaway account, made a public comment which led me to text him to not do that, then he threw a tantrum and blocked me (I hadn't blocked him up until then just told him I didn't want to keep in touch anymore). \n\nThis is what a guy who is not into sex looks like. So imagine if he was LMAO\n\nAnyway I was sick for a couple of weeks because of this, then I found out about the Voldemort sub, then this one. I moved on and I am going to travel in the summer on my own, so who gives a shit about his BS. hehe","created_utc":1621901092000,"comment_id":"gzaaknh","parent_id":"t3_njzrwg","score":26,"submission_id":"njzrwg"}

We are driven to an early grave from exhaustion and disappointment.\n\nCapitalism also needs us to birth more workers and consumers so government doesn't like us giving up on men either. \n\nI don't even like breathing the same air as them, let alone date the things.

She complained that everything that I read was too \"heavy\" (grin). Not only do they feel contrived and strange, most of them feel far too cookie cutter. Change the names, the ages, the venues and the stories are all the same. \n\nI tried my hand at it myself quite a few years ago and stalled. Everything that seemed deviate from the typically absurd, it just doesn't feel right. \n\nSome, I think is that a lot of these writers just want to make money. You have to be famous to make a lot being a writer. Or write a lot of books. The guide is \"why recreate the wheel\"? This is what sells. And hokey or not, I think it is a testament to how sad and miserable their lives are that so many have to \"escape\" into other people's romance stories. Even bad romance is better than no romance. \n\nI guess all we can do is try to write some good ones. Some better ones. I've found it easier to write my romances as a secondary or even third idea and not the primary focus. I find it easier to make it sound natural. Letting them sort of show up organically. Probably because I'm not focusing on it. Not sure how good they are (I like them \ud83e\udd2d), but since I started writing more, I started reading less.

I'm emotionally stunted. My mind pretty much can temporarily block out all the former emotional traumas. Because I'm simply trying to cope with this hellish life was forced into, and dating became like a drug.\n\n My mother was all about 'the men.'

She let men walk all over her, then she'd get angry at her children who didn't ask to be ....\n\n Despite having a major disorder which caused me intense identity disturbances...I always maintained my childfree stance.  That is one identity I will never sacrifice for no man. I would sooner rip my uterus out with my own hands, than incubate some ungrateful man's offspring. Where he can pump and dump.

She has absolutely no idea how he talks about her behind her back, and that he acts as if he's done her a favour by marrying her. He doesn't seem to see that she is the victim here, being strung along by a man who thinks he's too good for her (despite the fact she's gorgeous and has an amazing career).\n\nWhat is wrong with these people?!","created_utc":1619974436000,"comment_id":"gwn0b5m","parent_id":"t3_n2bbh6","score":19,"submission_id":"n2bbh6"}

{"author":"immortallogic","body":"Lol I hear you, but this story should make you feel better about yourself and all the bullets you're dodging by pursuing this lifestyle. \n\nI'd suggest maybe getting off social media, especially if you're at the age when many of your acquaintances are getting married\/having kids, and if you feel like it may have an impact on how you feel about yourself (although your stance seems very strong, it can be easy to see all these pictures that feed into the traditional societal narrative and think very briefly \"damn, am I f'ng up?\"). The answer is, no, you're not. \n\nIf you're looking for some words of support\/validation here they are: you are literally making one of the best decisions a woman can make. To decide to be unencumbered by the traditional tropes that very often pull women down (marriage\/kids), is one of the most liberating things you can do. The road will be lonely at times, but the satisfaction of knowing that you won't have to put up with a ton of bs that comes with the normal narrative and that you'll have the freedom to do whatever the hell you want with few strings, is incredibly powerful. If you want some quotes:\n\nTo live alone is the fate of all great souls  - Schopenhauer\n\nThe individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened.

Many women even feel like they have no right to be angry. But anger needs to be acknowledged and managed in a healthy way. That's why I release my anger by going into the woods to scream, instead of taking it out on innocent people. It's awful that your mother is unpredictable and volatile. That's horribly traumatic.

{"author":"Key-Possibility-5200","body":"TLDR: there are social reasons for women with children to settle for any man, single moms are always socially disadvantaged.\n\nWith children there is a benefit to having a man. I do get lots of tax breaks but I miss out on a lot of social gravity not having a man.\n\nI say this as a single mother. There\u2019s a social benefit to having a man, even a shitty one. There\u2019s empirical data around this as well. School administrators are harsher when it comes to disciplining children of single moms. All of the systems (financial, childcare, education, medical, legal) are set up to ignore what women say and only listen to men. I\u2019ve seen this first hand during my process of leaving an abuser. When I filed a restraining order which calmly stated the physical abuse event I endured, it took 48 hours for him to be served, time I had to hide in a hotel. When he countered with a retaliatory restraining order claiming I cheated on him (which, if true, wouldn\u2019t necessitate a restraining order) and made jokes about the kids drowning in a pool (also a lie and if true not a reason for a restraining order). His testerical RO was approved by a male judge and served to me by the sheriff less than four hours after he filed it. Through the entire process of divorcing an abuser I always had to prove every claim I made against him before it was believed. Everything he said was taken as true until I proved it wrong. \n\nEven if the man doesn\u2019t help the woman in any way, there is social cachet to having a man As part of your family. I even see this in social situations where you wouldn\u2019t think it matters- like when we go to Disneyland. Families with a man don\u2019t have to push through the crowds in the same way, people move aside for men. Me and my kids have to travel in different ways.\n\nETA: another example. I used to live in a fairly shitty apartment complex. Many residents decorated their porch. My decorations were constantly stolen and I would see them on the porch of families with men. They\u2019d be sitting there drinking beer, looking straight across the courtyard at me after stealing my potted plant for themselves. You can\u2019t tell me I would get away with that as a single woman, just stealing a cute yard decoration and then proudly displaying it on my own porch. They got away with doing that to me because I\u2019m \u201cjust\u201d a woman, what can I do, their man could kill me over a potted plant. So I didn\u2019t get to decorate while they did.","created_utc":1699575242000,"comment_id":"k8in1n1","parent_id":"t3_17rb802","score":16,"submission_id":"17rb802"}

Her child is still preschool, and she has no plans for a second one. In China, grandparents often care for their grandchildren, and this is another reason husbands are increasingly regarded as unnecessary.\n\nThe term kong hun zu (marriage phobia group) is already widely used by young women.\n\nMeanwhile, men living in rural areas remain keen to have wives to help with family businesses and to raise children who will eventually take over. But the division of the sexes living in urban and rural areas continues to widen.\n\n[[Image link - President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, only have one child, their daughter Xi Mingze. (Captured from the website of CCTV)\n]](https:\/\/www.ft.com\/__origami\/service\/image\/v2\/images\/raw\/https%253A%252F%252Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fimages%252F_aliases%252Farticleimage%252F9%252F4%252F9%252F6%252F40166949-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-1651202060photo_SXM2022041900005924.png?source=nar-cms)\n\n\"Dear Child,\" a popular TV series that depicts marital conflict over having children and bringing them up has stoked controversy. The series revolves around a young couple whose relationship deteriorates after their child is born. They quarrel over their parents' involvement in running the house, the burdens of child rearing and treatment of the child when it is sick.\n\nThe Chinese authorities became concerned that Dear Child would further discourage marriages. The April 11 online edition of the People's Daily, the official organ of the Chinese Communist Party, carried a commentary warning against TV dramas that \"sell anxiety.\"\n\n\"There is also a view that it is not appropriate to depict family clashes and contradictions this much,\" the article said.\n\nBefore being aired, programs are all strictly vetted by the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, so it is unusual for the authorities to have anything further to say. On this occasion, it caused a backlash that only fueled the controversy.\n\n\"This is a common scene,\" said one viewer. \"The reality is more miserable.\"\n\nFewer marriages translates into fewer births, meaning that the government may be facing a downward spiral.\n\nIts unexpected response was not to increase marriages but to try and reduce the number of divorces. In 2021, a cooling-off period was introduced for couples applying to divorce.\n\nDivorce applications could be withdrawn during a 30-day period after being filed. And if the couple did not request the actual divorce certificate after that time, the application was deemed to have been withdrawn. In 2021, the number of divorces nearly halved from a year earlier to 2.13 million.\n\nLast year, the government introduced a policy of allowing couples to have a third child. Even so, the decline in births has shown no sign of abating in 2021. The number fell by 1.38 million to 10.62 million in what was the fifth consecutive annual fall.\n\nIn theory, everything that happens in China is guided by the CCP, but young people's changing attitude toward marriage appears to be beyond official reach.","created_utc":1688212823000,"comment_id":"jq7yuh6","parent_id":"t3_14nh2dl","score":23,"submission_id":"14nh2dl"}

Women are still minority in the field as well.\n\nIn principle you should be able to get hired to male dominated fields like construction for example but I don't think in practice that happens a lot.\n\nI think some companies try to enforce positive discrimination rules to be more inclusive and diverse but its not the norm.","created_utc":1681773927000,"comment_id":"jgmdati","parent_id":"t3_12pkjhb","score":29,"submission_id":"12pkjhb"}

Even had a Incel throw his victim card at me yesterday on r\/ feminism. \n\nToo many of men today have fragile male egos. The minute a woman says something there's always some Misogynist waiting in the shadows to break her down, play their fragile male victim card, too liberal woke, too religious conservative, or worse. Potentially harm her or keep her imprisoned. Esp. she lives in a dangerous parts of the world. \n\nAgree. I hate this woman hating world with all my heart. And i cannot wait to leave. I think the misogyny is sooo common-place today more than ever in this porn sick and religion saturated, discusting world. It's getting MUCH worse almost everywhere too.   \n\nSo glad to be afraid of pregnancy, and I spread legitimate fears to younger generations of women. I just couldn't imagine bringing esp. a daughter into this hell. I would probably end up in prison for a mercy kill. Or to be safest, a murder su-cide.\n\nImo.

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"Not sure if that's specific to just men or it's humans in general. If so then that sounds more like misanthropy... I can relate. I am also not very enthusiastic to engage with certain type of women. I hate women who create drama and like to compete with other women for silly stuff like I don't know clothes or men or whatever those women compete for lol. \n\nOverall if the person is chill and has the same vibe as me it's fine, I don't mind if it's men or women... Because honestly nowadays it's so hard for me to relate with someone, I can't afford to be picky. Women or men, care is always needed to set your boundaries, but because I am heterosexual, with men, extra care is required to avoid engaging in romantic dramas. And obviously it's impossible to be friends with some men.\n\nIf I have any romantic interest with a guy I don't keep friends with that person. If I see it's not going to work (which 99.99% of the time, it doesn't), then I cut the evil by its root. I am only friends with men I am not interested in romantically or sexually and if they start wanting more, then time to seek other friends. I basically dislike anything that can harm my peace and emotional balance.  \n\nBut in my daily life I don't obsess about \"oh my god, he is a man, I am running away\".

It's all so exhausting.  And now with modern dating, they'll only give you a coffee if that, because they're stingy and selfish.  Like why do I have to go through all the effort of buying expensive clothes, put hours into learning about putting on makeup, shaving 90% of my body, and pretending to enjoy PIV sex all for a measly 50\/50 date that involved no planning on his part.  Plus the guy won't shave off that nasty stank beard with old cheeto crumbs in it.  And he's probably hiding an STD and a couple of kids from different women that he doesn't support or see.  Also add in that he eats like shit, is overweight but expects a 10\/10, and has a porn and video game addiction.\n\nWhy in THE HELL would a woman bare the average guy's children, work full time, go 50\/50, exercise regularly, do 90% of the housework, take on all the mental load, plan all doctors appointments\/play dates\/extracurriculars while the idiot just sits there drinking a beer and then insists on sleeping in the same room but has severe sleep apnea and snores like hell.  I can't imagine how many women get murder fantasies just looking at how easy their man falls asleep and snores through the whole night.

{"author":"a_mulher","body":"A couple of years ago I didn't know what the whole men going on their own thing was. Read through a few posts and was incredibly perplexed. The concept that I was disposable because of some arbitrary age line these dudes had agreed upon didn't make sense to me. If anything, a woman of that age marrying, having a child or moving in with a guy is taking all the risk and getting a tiny reward. In fact when I think to my 40s, 50s and beyond I can't fathom why in the hell I'd want to settle for the sake of having someone. And by settle I don't mean I wanted a very attractive very wealthy man (or ew an alpha man) - I meant wanting a high functioning adult man to build a partnership with. Going it alone eliminates that risk of getting dumped the moment a younger model comes along. I can spend my money how I want to and on what I want to. Spend time on my hobbies. How many guys take care of their ill\/elderly spouses? Statistically there's a higher chance that a guy of my same age will get sick and die before I do - meaning I'll still die alone (which is how society scares women into marriage - but who'll take care of you) except I'll have spent the last active years of my life taking care of an elderly spouse instead of on my own life pursuits.

I truly don't believe that there are right and wrong answers to how to live one's life.  You just have to be intentional about making the choices that are right for you in the situation you find yourself.  Some people truly do find happy hetero marriages with thoughtful, empathetic men.

Then one of them (the woman, mind you) said \"Well, she lives alone!\". I stared at her dumbfolded and she kept on \"she never remarried! I'm not sure she even dated again, and she lives alone to this day!\".\n\nI had to control myself to not start laughing and answered \"okay, but you didn't answer me, is she bitter and unpleasant? Like, constantly mad at things or saddened?\". Silence, again, and they started to look embarrassed. I was about to get into the elevator and ended it with \"well, I live alone too and Im not unhappy or bitter at all, so I assure you that's not an issue.

{"author":"siberianfrost","body":"There has never been a point in my life I truly wanted a romantic relationship, except out of familial and social pressure, or wanting consistent company and cuddles but living in a culture where you have to be partnered in a sexual way to receive said affection. [Sekhmet She-Owl](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F6Of6g45U3c) elaborates on this. \n\nRelationships are an ideal that is sold to us for the benefit of the utopian ideal nuclear family, but domestic violence and divorce rates shed a different light. \n\nIf you have a healthy partnership, great for you! However, it's not worth putting yourself in danger to search for something that is the exception, and not the norm. \n\nHealthy relationships are formed when one has a healthy relationship with themself, boundaries are of the utmost importance, and every person I've met in a happy marriage wasn't looking for it!  Relationships aren't a goal, they're something that happens by chance. If you view them as something lucky to have, but not necessary to your wellbeing, and work on yourself, they are something that slips into obscurity.\n\nThat said, you must outlet your other \"needs.\" Finding close groups of women to share physical affection like cuddles with, exploring your sexual needs through masturbation, etc. \n\nYou have to deprogram the idea that your romantic needs can only be met through a sexual and\/or male partner. \n\nThere is, however, nothing wrong with experiencing those hormones and you shouldn't beat yourself up over it. They are meant to pair bond us in the early years of a potential child to protect them until about the ages of 2-5 when they are most vulnerable.

Just like patriarchy isn't just about men dominating over women, the role of the father is a key element (being in control of a nuclear family, getting privileges in society etc).\n\nSo while I do think matriarchy would be an improvement over patriarchy, I don't think it's the best option for childfree, 4B, separatist, antinatalist etc etc women to strive for. Because the women who like the idea of a matriarchy generally want to continue being with men and having children with them, so naturally their goals will not always align with ours.","created_utc":1729810953000,"comment_id":"ltiti7k","parent_id":"t3_1gb0phg","score":29,"submission_id":"1gb0phg"}

{"author":"FARTHARLOT","body":"The desire for connection is human, but romance has been intensely romanticized because there\u2019s a lot of money and power that can come from putting romantic love on a pedestal. Pushing marriage and family with men via media and societal norms is a great way to keep birth rates and Hollywood profits up. \n\nJust remember that while desire for companionship is normal, that image of a beautiful family with a caring man and a white picket fence isn\u2019t real.

{"author":"QueenRaflesia","body":"It's human to feel nostalgic, from time to time. But regarding the \"romantic dream of a relationship with a man,\" we must have the courage to open our eyes and smell the T. The romantic dream must be deconstructed: in most cases it is the trick used by men to get what they really care about (sex or a cook\/maid\/housekeeper). When you have little contact with men, it's easy to forget what they're really like. That's why I always recommend observing what men do, not what they say. Take a look at their forums, in the manosphere, if you can listen to the conversations they make between them in real life as well. Find out about the numbers surrounding the  p\\*rn industry, the s\\*x work, etc. One look at these things and the romantic dream will evaporate fast. They are utterly incapable of true empathy for women: if they were, they would not be able to have s\\*x with girls and women deported from their countries and threatened with vi\\*lence. Instead, most do it without a thought.","created_utc":1717263528000,"comment_id":"l6lozgy","parent_id":"t3_1d4mbrl","score":11,"submission_id":"1d4mbrl"}

{"author":"ar_tiny30","body":"As a longer-term member, I can attest that when I first joined this sub over a year ago it had more engagement and it was very much centered around talking about women living their best lives, with very little focus on or mention of men at all. People would discuss their gardens or the new apartment they bought and how they decorated it and the peace they feel being single and the lovely women they've met who are also wgtow and their pets and their hobbies and their accomplishments and their travels. It was a very positive environment.\n\nI've noticed a drastic a shift over the past year towards the sub being far more negative and man-focused, with frequent discussions about trauma and how awful men are and while I totally get it (we all came here for a reason and it's not because interacting with men was sunshine and rainbows), it's ironically made this sub a lot less wgtow, because if you're constantly talking about and thinking about men and still letting them bring negativity into your life, you're not really going your own way. \n\nI understand that women have so few places to vent to like-minded people, but I would love to see this sub shift back to focusing on our joy, rather than our suffering. I will say that it has been a little better again recently and I'll be much more eager to actively participate in the sub again if it stays like this. A lot of us that made it this far are past the angry-at-the-world stage of healing and are focused on maintaining our peace. It was hard to do that when every other post here was about male violence.\n\nSociety doesn't like single, happy women. They want us to be bitter and jaded, because that feeds into their narrative about us. We can't change the past. We can only move forward and prioritize our happiness. That in itself *is* our rebellion.\n\nSo anywho... everyone please start posting cute photos of your dogs and gardens and creative projects again, because that stuff made this sub amazing!","created_utc":1659578215000,"comment_id":"iit79s7","parent_id":"t3_w8ov1z","score":3,"submission_id":"w8ov1z"}

{"author":"zippy_rainbow","body":"I wonder how much my own family situation has led to me always having felt like this about marriage.

Every single woman I knew as a kid seemed run ragged with chores and cooking and taking kids to activities, while their husbands did very little other than go to work. I remember thinking how awful it would be to grow up, and to have to live like that, and decided to make the most of my twenties before I was resigned to a life of servitude.\n\nI can only assume that women who seem happily married and to enjoy their family lives grew up in much better environments where their mothers were supported and loved. They seem to just see the world through a totally different lens, where they just expect their partners to be supportive and take on their share of the burden.

But I think the last time I tried dating made me recalibrate and realize that kind of socialization isn\u2019t what I need in my life anymore. So I\u2019m taking social distancing up another level. \n\nAt face value, it\u2019s about receiving validation from men that you\u2019re still attractive and desirable. I\u2019m at the point in my life where I know my appeal and don\u2019t doubt it. So I don\u2019t need them to tell me I\u2019m pretty. Feels shallow to want that. I value more the health of my brain and work to preserving that, cuz I want to be mentally present way into my senior years. What is beauty if the brain is empty. \n\nRelationships with men are a high risk gamble to me therefore it\u2019s stress that I would expose myself to if I volunteered myself for it. And stress is a common denominator for lots of diseases. I\u2019ve been self-sustainable and self-accountable for so long that it really bothers me both psychologically and physiologically to have someone come into my life and destabilize things. \n\nI still interact with men but not with the mindset of befriending or flirting with them. I treat them all like distant co-workers or acquaintances. I\u2019ve been applying this mental filter for myself that makes me less sensitive and conscientious, not that I\u2019m rude. I just practice being grey rock which is being as bland, monotone as possible so they give up trying.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what a relationship with a man could enhance in my life. I don\u2019t need that financial support, I have my friends and family for the emotional\/mental well being. I used to be open to having children but my priorities are different now and if I seek a man\u2019s company, it\u2019s likely going to be temporary. Maybe when I\u2019m in my 50s, I\u2019ll have a fling for a week.

The effects of birth control pills can range from virtually nothing at all to death. My 20 year old daughter passed away in September of 2018 due to blood clots in her lungs that were triggered by her use of a combination birth control pill. Before going on birth control pills, at least consider exhausting all natural options. If you do decide to go on birth control pills, please have a good understanding of your maternal and paternal family medical history. In some people, birth control pills may trigger serious underlying genetic health issues. The medical community will say that what happened to my daughter was extremely rare. That may be true based on various statistics and reports. Nevertheless, taking birth control pills can result in death. If you have a family history of blood clots or cardiovascular disease, taking birth control pills could result in serious irreversible illness or even death. Please be safe, please be careful, and most importantly please become more informed. Remember it\u2019s your health and possibly your life that\u2019s at stake and not the pharmaceutical industry or the medical community.

{"author":"runningforthills","body":"OMG I was literally just thinking about this today. Seriously... I just have had this on my mind all day.\n\nI am bisexual and have become only interested in dating women. However on this journey I have such a difficult time *not* connecting with men and dating them. Mostly it started because I had all genders on dating apps and men are just easier--because I have only dated men seriously, it's easier to know what they want bc they're simple, etc. - and I'm feminine so they materialize because women don't assume I'm into them. Well, I finally realized men for the most part don't make me happy or feel like partners (one reason I got on this sub; it resonated with me). Something always triggers me and turns me off and I break it off (I suppose I could be gay, but I've been very sexually attracted to men before, even within the last six months. I think realizing the intellectual and intimate connection is lacking for me has made me less sexually attracted to them lately). I always feel like a sexual object; I know that some of them care about me as more, but it always comes back to that. My attraction towards men has been waning and I have even broken off most male friendships now, since they always want to sleep with me and it f\\*cks things up, and for this exact reason: I can't seem to get out of the mindset that male validation is important. This is a huge symptom of my trauma from being in a patriarchal anti-LGBTQ church long into adulthood. (Yes, I've been to lots of therapy)\n\nI think there is something psychological that makes me want male validation, desire, and approval, even though I don't want to have sex with them. But then as a result of their pressure and my difficulty setting boundaries, and confusion in knowing what I want because of such late social\/sexual\/individualistic development, I often do end up having sex with them. I have never really \"regretted\" it, but sometimes felt depressed that I didn't stick to my plan, or just not wanted to do it again with them. It leads to me hurting people I care about, and not feeling true to myself. This attitude and feeling has mostly hit me once I decided I really want to focus on ONLY women, which is pretty recently. On social media, I sometimes crave the male validation, which comes less as I own my sexuality since I become less available if I choose to date women (boo-ya, mother f\\*ckers).\n\nAfter breaking off all of my male friendships that made me uncomfortable, I had one last one. This person actually does make me feel pretty safe and feels like nothing but a friend; I enjoyed our friendship which never turned romantic. I told him repeatedly that I wasn't interested, despite us meeting on a dating app, and he was \"cool\" with that; I had no sexual feelings for him, but after getting to know him over a long time I started to have some small romantic feelings for him one night. I think he could sense this and sort of pushed things into that zone. Honestly, I think I was just starting to feel love for him as a person\/friend. I wouldn't have chosen for it to go there, but I guess I felt some curiosity and because I cared for him as a friend thought \"eh why not\" when he kissed me; I was a bit isolated and lonely and he's one of the few people I've been seeing since my last breakup, and I guess I wanted some human connection. Yet my feelings never changed. I didn't feel a sexual connection with him any more than before. Not even a romantic connection. He clearly does. I still care about him as a friend and would be fine with things staying that way. \n\nRegardless of whether that's possible or not (whether he can be a friend), I'm just.... mad at myself, and confused. I already KNEW I want to date only women now. I'm not in a place to jump on apps again, but when I do, it will be women. I know this. He knows this. Yet I feel like he kind of took advantage of my confusion. He's not that type of person, but... thought I hate over-generalizations, I am starting to believe EVERY male is. They see what they want to see, so they pressure women; my mistake has always been listing to what a man says instead of realizing his behavior is what matters--men on the other hand don't listen to my words yet try to interpret my behavior in a biased manner. I can't believe that even a friend I felt safe with did this (we DID meet on a dating app, but he was a friend because I told him I wasn't interested; I think he must have always thought there was potential). I just feel like every male ends up disappointing me. Hence this sub.\n\nBut what matters to me more is: why can't **I** stop letting this happen? Why can't **I** demand boundaries and uphold them? Why do I behave as if I need that male validation? I think this is the last time since I've cut every other friendship off with any potential to become sexual, but there's this fear that I'll feel like something is missing or less-than or that I have less value (the brainwashing and trauma hits again). Theoretically I do have feelings for both genders.... but clearly men haven't made me happy. I'm not a fan of setting a \"rule\" for myself but I feel like I have to! In other words.... I have the same question as you.","created_utc":1606841848000,"comment_id":"ge8rz7y","parent_id":"t3_k4am87","score":6,"submission_id":"k4am87"}
{"author":"Hmtnsw","body":"When my ex and I broke up I talked to men right away. I slept with someone literally 2 weeks after the breakup. It was not for seeking validation though. It was to get my dick fix because I had just gotten out of a dead bedroom as my ex wanted to go have sex with men instead. That 1 man turned into several (my libido is though the roof). I probably came off as seeking validation but I played them at their own games. Hump, dump, next. \n\nI eventually got out of that. I'm now voluntarily celibate so I can focus on my important things. I am struggling with living by dogma and making sure I come off a certain way to make myself more \"appealing to men.\" (My family pressures me a lot). And trying to fully embrace my true self and not caring if I end up alone. I've been the \"lone wolf\" type since I was a little girl. I'm talking like pre-K. \n\nHow I empower myself is becoming stronger (working out a certain way) and trying to learn how to manipulate money (short-term, long-term income NYSE kind of stuff). I am actually talking to a guy who is helping me with that. I also do independent readings on what he says so I can make my own educated decisions before making any moves. \n\nIdk if you are religious or spiritual... but I'm a Pagan and try to be more in tune with Pagan holidays to get closer to my Gods and strengthen my faith, along with my ability in witchcraft. (If you don't believe, that is fine). My point is, focus on something that makes you feel grounded and closer connected to your inner self- whatever that is for you. \n\nI'm learning a second language and that is empowering. \nI enjoy learning about other cultures. I'm reading a book on what it was like living in N. Korea back in the 80s\/90s and tutor Chinese Nationals and my culture [American] isn't really that different from mainland China (especially when regarding women). Tbh, the women I meet on there are very open to talk about the struggles of being a woman and what is expected of them and they are the only IRL outlet I have to talk about it other than my therapist. \n\nTl;dr \nTo put it simply, to me it is about putting yourself first and focusing on things you want to do and become better at. Make sure whoever you do decide to interact with (men or women) you can learn something valuable from them.","created_utc":1606864023000,"comment_id":"ge9iko1","parent_id":"t3_k4am87","score":5,"submission_id":"k4am87"}

Right after the first semester there started, we girls were shown around in the convent building where the sisters lived. There is a cloistered part inside every female convent where no man is allowed to set foot in. Sr Hildegard, my headmistress and later philosophy teacher, refusing my teacher entry there, but allowing us girls into this most sacred and intimate part of the convent made a deep, deep impression on me.\n\nToday I'm a radical Lesbian feminist, and it is in no small part due to the experiences in my school.\n\n  \n(When Sr Hildegard, the last sister headmistress, grew too old to run the school, the order gave it to the nation-wide platform of church-run schools.

There is no all-girls school left in my entire country now, despite research showing clearly girls benefit hugely from same sex education.

The only way to make sure you're not tied down to a man who's in control, especially when you have children, and to ensure you're respected in everyday society AND don't have to succumb to gender-based violence among other forms of subjugation is to turn to God.\n\n\nIt's one way, and the easiest way, to become free (to a certain degree). I have met many feminist nuns, all of whom do the best that they can for their communities, especially other women. I'm not religious myself, but I can see the appeal when you want something better in life and want to help others, but don't have access to m\/any other ways to make that happen in a safe and supportive environment.","created_utc":1717349013000,"comment_id":"l6que4v","parent_id":"t3_1d628lj","score":23,"submission_id":"1d628lj"}
{"author":"QueenRaflesia","body":"It's all true. Throughout the Middle Ages, until the modern age, women's monasteries were a refuge for women and some of them centers of culture. The Catholic Church has a strongly patriarchal imprint, however female monasticism has been for centuries the alternative to forced marriages and pregnancies. Most of the intellectual and artistic women of the Middle Ages were nuns, although many of them have been forgotten. The women who lived in the monasteries were the only ones who could study and devote themselves to the arts and meditation. Obviously, life in a monastery was not without conflicts or dangers, women's monasteries were looked upon with suspicion by the ecclesiastical authority, but they still represented a precious possibility for those who did not want to be either a wife or a mother. With the Catholic Counter-Reformation, the rules were made more restrictive for women and so things changed. \n\nObviously, with the modern era, many different possibilities have opened up for women and therefore monastic life is no longer the only alternative. However, monastic life exerts a certain fascination on me: I am not a believer, but I consider myself a sort of urban hermit.","created_utc":1717394665000,"comment_id":"l6trntm","parent_id":"t3_1d628lj","score":16,"submission_id":"1d628lj"}

{"author":"Queasy-Garden-726","body":"Growing up with my highly codependent serial monogamist mother made me see my worth only through the lens of being wanted by men. My mother was struggling both with her mental health, finances and a series of terrible boyfriends. The only thing she taught me was to always find a man, because ending up alone is the absolutely worse thing that can happen to a woman. So I started dating super early and always made sure to be in a relationship - that was the only time my mom paid me any attention, living vicariously through my relationships and sharing experience. \n\nI didn't know at that time that I'm also struggling with my mental health issues (my mom never got diagnosed, so I thought it was normal), and it made me vulnerable to fall victim to the worse kind of men, who saw me as an easy prey, groomers etc. I finally opened my eyes during my mid 20s, started therapy, and learnt the necessary relationship skills. It still seemed like a lot work - women are supposed to do all the emotional labor, most of housework, eventually childrearing and of course pay half of the bills. I realized I wanted to remain childfree. I still wanted a partner, the fear and shame of staying single scared me to death. \n\nHowever, as all my attempts to find a suitable partner failed, I slowly opened myself up to an idea of staying single. I went NC with my mother who was dragging my mental health down. I ditched the idea of living with a man, because it was always very devastating for my mental health. \n\nI opened myself up for the idea of casual dating, as sadly I'm very sexually attracted to men and I have very high libido (honestly it's my worst flaw). I thought it would be very easy as a NSA relationship seem to be every men's dream. Oh boy, was I wrong. Men still expect all the girlfriend labor in this situation, while giving absolutely zero in return. And also, porn. Even if I found a man that is not interested in the most disgusting, violent porn, they are still influenced. Men are not even attracted to women nowadays - they are disgusted by women bodies and demand the look of a prepubescent girl. That always made me uncomfortable and I was definitely not willing to put up with it all just for a casual sex. \n\nSo that's why I finally decided to start my WGTOW journey in my early 30s. I still struggle with my mental health. I still feel lonely and scared of dying alone. I sometimes crave having a loving partner. And then I realize that I only like the romantic idea, not the actual relationships. None of my exes or even partners of my friends were supportive partners that I want. They wouldn't support me through my crisis, they'd expect me to do my \"job\" and take over their struggles as well.

I literally have only gone out about a handful of times only to go to the doctor\u2019s since like 2019 (I was isolating well before the pandemic due to body dysmorphic disorder, panic disorder, and not wanting to interact with people or have relationships due to the aforementioned interpersonal trauma) and I don\u2019t talk to anyone besides random people on reddit like in this comment rn, or my mom who I live with. I work from home but it\u2019s\nsolo work that doesn\u2019t require human interaction. I\u2019m 29. Over these years of isolation, my mental health has absolutely declined dramatically (even moreso lol) due to the isolation. Human beings are social creatures and I think the level of isolation I\u2019m going through is unnatural and would be detrimental for most of us. But the circumstances and reasons behind my isolation are also psychologically detrimental within themselves so I think it depends on a lot of factors such as the reasons behind it, and there are also diff levels of isolation.

It was *never* a privilege to be a SAHM and depend on a husband.  Why?  Because prior to the 1990s and 2000s, a man could divorce his wife and leave her with ZERO.  Alimony and child support were (and still are) a joke; no amount of money could fix the moo and kid going into poverty the minute that the man-child left.  Incidentally, that's why so many boomer and Gen X women stayed (or have stayed) in bad marriages. \n\nStill think that's a \"privilege\"?\n\nEven now, SAHMs usually have NO savings whatsoever and are dependent on their adult children and grandchildren to support them through death.  The wage gap isn't that extreme between single, childfree women and men because the former didn't buy the Cinderella shit.  Where it becomes obvious is with the mommies; they gave up *years* of income in favor of man-child's sperm.

{"author":"nanofarm","body":"Kindly, I would argue that patriarchy is bad for women\u2019s health and male run patriarchal fundamentalist \u201ctraditionalist\u201d (especially Christian in the US)  is an expression of that patriarchy. \n\nPersonally, I am an atheist and a Jew and have found religion to be a great source of strength and has buttressed my support system and strengthened my ability to live on my own. When I was bedridden and undergoing chemo, it was the women in my synagogue who brought groceries and meals and took my kid for the day to beach or park with them so I could rest and she could see friends. The older women are a great source of inspiration as many are single by choice as well or are happily married to decent men. Our rabbi is a divorced woman, and was a great source of counsel and comfort for me when I decided to end my marriage. In fact, when it came to light that my ex was abusive, she rallied multiple lawyers for me and testified in custody court for me. The men in the community put a lot of pressure on him to grant my Get and to agree to let me keep the house and to pay child support. They literally would walk him to I\u2019m his car after work and hang out at his tennis club in groups until he backed down. \n\nI realize that I am being a devils advocate at this point and I\u2019m sorry for that. \n\nI think going our own way is a process of separation from patriarchal dynamics and most main stream Christian religion reinforces the patriarchy. So the article is a helpful and valid thing to share. Jews are a very small minority so I don\u2019t want to \u201cwhatabout\u201d all over to e place here. However, I do think that we can make mindful choices in all areas of our lives and building community is essential for single women in a world designed to enforce heterosexual coupledom. I\u2019ve seen all female Unitarian churches, non denominational women\u2019s groups and such fill this role as well. Separatism is an essential step to ending the patriarchy but that doesn\u2019t mean being an island either. That\u2019s when I notice some struggle with GTOW as we are human and humans are a tribal species. But a relationship with a man isn\u2019t the only way to fill that need. \n\nThis got long.

It is labour, in the same way raising children (parenting) is labour, but not work.\n\nBeing paid fo something doesn't make that laboursome act work, creating value does. Work requires value-addition and commodification of the worker and of the product (in this case, a fetus or baby), and it requires the consumer.\n\nWhat is the added value of gestation? In market terms? How could anyone calculate that and what kind of sick society do we have to live in for people to be okay with that calculation?\n\nSurrogacy, just like prostitution, is a process in which vulnerable women are almost always groomed and then pimped out. The pimps or the \"fertility industry\" makes a shitload of money off of renting these women out while they impose ridiculous rules on their existance (what they can eat, how and how much they should exercise, what kind of conditions they can live in, can they have sex, etc.), and as a cherry on top: the consumers don't have to pay if they decide they don't like or don't want the product (i.e., baby) anymore.\n\nConversely, if the woman who is being rented out develops an attachement with the baby who she is literally growing in and with her body, she doesn't get to keep it.\n\nSo no, people are not against surrogacy because it pays. We are against it because it's exploitation of poor and vulnerable women. Just like prostitution is. It's literal commodification of the female body and no amount of \"but they like it\" or \"they choose to do this\" or whatever libfemmy excuse the fertility industry can come up with will change that fact.","created_utc":1607366653000,"comment_id":"gexizhb","parent_id":"t3_k8c70s","score":23,"submission_id":"k8c70s"}

{"author":"loraren","body":"When I hit puberty my mom took me to a department store and bought me a bunch of makeup. I\u2019m sure her intentions were good, she wanted me to be confident and happy. For 15+ years I wore a full face of makeup almost every day. Even when i was so overwhelmed studying and working, having 18 hour days. I didn\u2019t accept the bare-faced person I saw in the mirror - she was too flawed to expose to the world. \n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic I worked from home, rarely left the house, and didn\u2019t have many video calls. I had no reason to wear makeup. Over the year or so I gradually started to accept my bare face. \n\nWhen I got vaccinated and my office resumed in-office work, I decided to not wear makeup. Since I made that choice I LOVE my natural self for the first time in my life. This choice has had a multiplier effect across many areas of my life. Now that I fully accept and respect myself, I am finally able to stop being a doormat and demand respect from others. Now that I\u2019m not worrying about how I appear to coworkers, I have better focus and confidence in my capabilities and professional aspirations. Now that I have defined what I deserve and what my standards are, I accept that it\u2019s highly unlikely I\u2019ll find an adequate male partner. I\u2019m finally content with who I am today, I know I can fulfill all of my needs as an individual. \n\nI have had zero negative repercussions from not wearing makeup the past few months. No one has said a word about it to me. At work no one has treated me differently at all. \n\nAlso\u2026 read Beauty Sick by Renee Engeln.

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"I didn't know Sarah Paulson was lesbian. \n\nI watched the movie Carol yesterday and she is in it. Really liked the movie. \n\nIt made me wonder a few things. First of all the guys seem to tolerate when the women are lesbian. The husband of the main character didn't mind she had an affair with another woman, he just got upset when she left him. But honestly it was her that took the initiative because she was tired of being repressed. If she had put up with it more, he probably would close his eyes... So apparently dudes don't feel threatened by women, only by other men. \n\nAnd then both main characters of the movie had relationship with men and liked women... So are they lesbians and were repressed by society and forced to find a man? Are they bisexual?\n\nI personally feel like I am not a lesbian. I am interested in men but not enough to tolerate bullshit. If I wanted to be a lesbian I could freely pursue other women in the city, nobody would judge me because nobody knows me, my family isn't there so they wouldn't even have to know... But I don't feel the need to. Maybe I am just asexual or something because I like men but I am not willing to tolerate certain behaviours and thus I prefer to stay single. If I was an highly sexual person I'd either put up with certain behaviors to have a sexual partner or I'd seek a woman.\n\nThis reminds of the movie Shame. The guy was straight and a sex addict. At one point he was so desperate for sex he went into a gay club and had a guy doing him a blowjob. So his despair for sex actually made him go outside his sexual orientation... Not sure if that's good or bad or just neutral, just is.","created_utc":1621110904000,"comment_id":"gy7irf9","parent_id":"t1_gy2jhf6","score":5,"submission_id":"nbe3jz"}

This paradigm eventually prepares women for a life of losing themselves to the bearing and raising of children while their male partners go about their own lives, interests, careers, hobbies...  Women don't get to have objective interests and hobbies outside of the family unit.  Even those are revoked in order to be a slave to the nuclear family.\n\n(not to say that some women don't independently enjoy watching sports, but many (including me) don't.

{"author":"Hmtnsw","body":"I got bingoed when I went home for Christmas. Telling me how I need to find a man and have kids to have a purpose in life. \n\nMy uncle died of alcoholism 3 years ago on Christmas Day and he didn't have kids. He wanted them but he listened to his toxic family too much and left a woman he really loved for family (and family business) and his life went down hill from there. I think it was an act of suicide. \n\nAnyway, my father was like \"He wouldn't have done that if he had a kid to be there for.\" A part of me is like yeah, but as someone who had suicidal tendencies myself, you can find other ways to get out of the hole that doesn't involve children. Then my dad goes on to say about how \"*That's why marriage and having kids is important.*\" in this \"don't argue with me and do as your told tone.\" I squinted so hard I think I could have cut the air and he just grins at me. \n\nI'm so fucking SICK of it. \n\nEven if I wanted a man I DON'T want kids. Ever. \n\nMy family encourages me to stay away from bars because people who try to find people there are trash. Like no offense, but I think your dad boasting about his bar fucks is trash. Like... Just about every guy I've met who has hooked up with women at bars are seen those women as whores and no someone to give respect to. \n\nMy family however wants me to go meet guys at church dances because that is how they met. I no longer consider myself a part of the church or even of the faith. At ALL. I'm actually Pagan when in their eyes is probably worse than being an atheist. If I'm going to go to the church it is going to network for work connections not find some guy. \n\nMy mother the other day told me that she found out one of the new male missionaries is Asian. I have a preference for Asian and Hispanic men so she is like- oh, you might be interested! I told her indont want her opinion on him because she thinks all Asians are ugly period. He is from Cali so I'm assuming he is relatively attractive but I'm not going to go out of my way to meet a guy who will only be here for a few months (we probably won't have a lot in common because most people are boring anyway) and honestly I don't want to end up like my mother who married 2 church men and was\/is unhappy in her first and second marriage. But she is over here trying to get me to do the same. \n\nAbsolutely not.","created_utc":1609282056000,"comment_id":"ghe90wx","parent_id":"t3_kma4zr","score":14,"submission_id":"kma4zr"}

{"author":"warinmymind94","body":"sending hugs and sympathy, and I am sorry to hear about your uncle's passing. His story is very sad. Your family has a similar attitude about marriage and kids like my family does, they think kids and a man will fix problems and make you magically happy and \"complete\". marriage wont fix you, and bringing a child into this world is a huge responsibility. so many people really need to see professional therapists, doctors, and get treatments rather than jumping into a relationship or having kids. my mom had my sister as a way to try to \"fix\" her relationship with her father - she thought it would make him step up and want to be a good dad and family man, even though she had clearly seen he was a deadbeat absent father for the few years before my sister was born. \n\nit sounds like you were only visiting family for the holiday, and their negativity sounds unbearable even for that short amount of time. everyone in my family shames me and begs me to move home and trash talks me because im \"in my own world\" and \"left\" but I really had to. \n\nyour family is generally correct about avoiding bars as an area to meet guys, from my experiences going to any bars or clubs, the guys there generally just want hookups or have addiction to alcohol, drugs, or sex. and yeah my dad had a lot of bar hookups with women with no standards and bad reputations, and living In the same small town he is always bumping into one of them and they still try to sleep with him even though they know he's married. his advice is appalling and I cant believe he wants me to risk my safety, risk pregnancy, and risk disease for bar hookups. \n\nyeah my family is christian and my grandparents and uncle's family is very old school christian... and being a pagan is extremely frowned upon and they've made up all these awful things surrounding Paganism. They should love and accept you and your faith, and take the time to learn about it. They also sound like they were making some racial slurs - my parents do the same thing and even make threats about if I \"date outside my race\" - which I have and they said some awful things to him. \n\nusing the connections at your parent's church for networking purposes is actually clever though, people there know your family and can lend you a hand up when it comes to making progress in your career so if you have to tag along to your parents church this is the ideal way to leverage.\n\nhang in there and stick to yourself, sometimes going your own way is the best thing you can do to break the family's patterns and to find your own happiness and success","created_utc":1609425806000,"comment_id":"ghl28p2","parent_id":"t1_ghe90wx","score":1,"submission_id":"kma4zr"}

However we have a patriarchal society where almost everything is defaulted to masculine.  Even if the majority of people aren't men, we still assume that someone we are talking to on the internet is a man until we have cues that they might not be.\n\nThat being said this movement in and of itself is a niche movement.  You can create any platform you like for it, you still might not see the activity that you want.\n\nReddit is common among some particular subset of the population, but it's not common across the board.  So here we have an accessible place for those of us who are already inclined to use websites like Reddit.  You can try developing an app as that would be probably the most accessible form of creating a community, but you have to remember that even a lot of women who reach a mindset of \"men, never again\" are still well-conditioned to think \"until the right one\".\n\nIt would be nice to have a platform where we can have local pods to help build a stronger community.","created_utc":1676415539000,"comment_id":"j8ib77d","parent_id":"t3_111w5j1","score":18,"submission_id":"111w5j1"}

{"author":"queen-of-quartz","body":"Congratulations! You're going to love it. I closed on 75 acres last year and it's been a dream come true. I wish I never had to leave. I'm working on building greenhouses for veggies and have goats and chickens so I'm hoping I can avoid going into town as much as possible soon! A few word of advice though - in the beginning I felt like I could do it all on my own. But it's a lot of property to take care of, 12 acres is a lot too. I let some friends stay in a tiny home, rent-free for their labor (but they pay their own electric\/internet\/etc) whenever I want it lol, and it's really made a difference to have people help chop firewood, maintain trails. help build stuff etc. \n\nI would also recommend, if you don't already have one, to purchase at least two firearms - a handgun and a shotgun or hunting rifle. There have been cougars and coyotes interested in my goats and chickens, and warning shots work well to keep them away. And if one day I shoot one, guess I'll have cougar for dinner lol. I've also had thieves come to my property, and depending on how rural your property is the police might not help you. My local police said they don't respond to calls where I am, only the county sheriff does, and candidly told me that unless there was a dead body I can't really count on the sheriff to come out here. So if there's any trouble you need to be able to defend yourself. I'd also invest in a surveillance system when you build your house and trail cams for where electricity can't reach, my thieves were taken to court due to my cameras and I became a hero in the community because they'd been stealing from everyone. \n\nLast advice, get to know your neighbors! Most rural communities are small, so having a friendly neighbor on your side helps a lot, they give you all the intel. And if you were originally a city slicker like me who didn't know too much about country living, they can dispense great advice like \"hey neighbor, the bucks are shedding their horns right now so keep an eye out!\" (my tenant then proceeds to find a horn), or \"black trumpet mushrooms are in season rn, there's a local guy in town who buys them for  $12\/lb!\". I wouldn't have known any of that stuff if we hadn't stopped to have a quick chat. \n\nYou're going to be so happy and I'm excited for you!

As other sisters have already suggested, the first thing to do is to focus on what makes you feel good and prioritize serenity and peace of soul and mind. At that point, staying away from men will come instinctive and natural to you. First of all, take some time to regenerate. Read, but above all write, keep a diary with your thoughts, writing is essential to achieve clarity in thoughts. If possible, identify an activity that you really enjoy and keeps you flowing in the moment (for me it's drawing and painting). I'm a pretty introverted person, so I know it's not easy to make friends when you are an adult, but the more you become whole and serene, the more you could attract similar female friends.\n\nand about your question: \"How do I completely make myself unavailable to men?\", show you have a brain and you are good at using it.

{"author":"siberianfrost","body":"This might be controversial, but I would suggest reading the Unibomber Manifesto as it gives perspective to the phenomena of modern life. \n\nThroughout most of human history, we were all some type of farmer (or hunter\/scavenger). We derive pleasure from simple things such as the scent of coffee or tending to plants because they progress us forward despite no obvious longtime reward; they are meant to encourage our survival. \n\nThese mechanisms have been manipulated against us to make us more complacent in the current system, productive; it was intentionally engineered to be a an addicting cycle, like social media. \n\nWe have such large, longterm goals, we have been deprived of simple pleasures in the here and now. Although they are technically still in front of us, the mental patterns we have all developed make that excruciatingly difficult. Dopamine is responsible for motivation, but if it is overused via too much sensory input (invasive phones, computers, advertisements), in becomes weakened, as does our drive. It takes a long time to deprogram, and one must be aware. \n\nUnlike the comments offering surrogate activities (hobbies) after work, you might actually want to abandon society altogether. A slower life as a farmer or tradesperson in a small community of close and likeminded people who look out for each other can bring so much peace. Mind you there is a buffer time and it is difficult at first.

{"author":"Due_Engineering_579","body":"Now this entire post will sound like blasphemy for the western sector but I coped by unlearning heterosexuality. At first I realized that this longing can be turned to women if these women themselves are woman-oriented and not subjugated to men in every aspect of their behavior and appearance. Years later I accepted as fact what I have always suspected -- that women's romantic longing is a misplaced longing for the mother they never had. I think Chinese radfems have figured this one out as well. \n\nMost of us were not loved in childhood. Many of us had batshit mothers that made the idea of having close relationships with women repulsive. Romance feels essential because you were deprived of the emotions that were essential for your development. Women see romance as a way to re-live their childhood the right way. To have someone love them and to have a home where they're welcome. You could say they're universal wants. True to an extent, but if they're so strong that you can't stop expecting them from your enemy after you were told that he can give them to you, even despite the fact that all he has ever given to you up to this point was abuse and disrespect, this becomes sus.\n\nThere is no male unicorn. A man has to be at odds with everyone and everything since childhood and to actively reject the things that benefit him to even have a chance of seeing you as a human being. All men do not even come close. They're very cowardly and conformist, and even when they're progressive and humanist, it only concerns their fellow dudes. Even the most progressive dude believes that women should be prostituted (consensually of course) and second-classed (because they choose to). \n\nShort answer: realize that your longing is misplaced. It is real and justified, but dudes were not meant to and cannot help you with it.","created_utc":1703442285000,"comment_id":"keq5btz","parent_id":"t3_18pqa4l","score":84,"submission_id":"18pqa4l"}

Basically, I just see reality for what it is and the male culture for what it is; it thrives off of existing as anti-female and with that being the culture the human race currently thrives in, there's no real incentive for things to change.","created_utc":1703467617000,"comment_id":"kerfezm","parent_id":"t3_18pqa4l","score":18,"submission_id":"18pqa4l"}

{"author":"ar_tiny30","body":"Society puts way too much emphasis on women being beautiful physically. You may be beautiful, you may not be. When it really comes down to it, beauty entirely depends on the person looking at you, because everybody has a different idea of what is beautiful to them. You can't control that. \n\nAnybody who would treat you poorly, just for being \"ugly\" to them is someone that, frankly, should disgust you. They clearly value nothing else beyond superficial traits and that's not someone whose opinion I would ever value or give any weight to. Why would you listen to beauty advice from someone with an ugly personality? \n\nThe thing is, why are we valuing physical beauty over being a good person? Being an interesting person? Being a *happy* person?\n\nBecause honestly, all the most beautiful people I've met have been the ones that are happy and confident in their own skin, whether they fit into conventional beauty standards or not. Their own comfort with doing their own thing regardless of what other people think about them, helps give other people the confidence to do the same. They're attractive in the sense that you *want* to be around them, not because they're a model, but because they're a joy to be around. They're radiant.\n\nYour body is beautiful because it contains you. Not because it's the \"right\" size or shape or colour and fits the standard. You can be model beautiful and still be the ugliest person in the room.

There's only a 10-15 age difference between us, but the men they had were more principled, yet still had their drawbacks.  I see very little reason to interact with men my age.  Men older than me think they can tell me what to do - yawn.  Perhaps one day I will give a man a chance, but being a fellow FDS member solely for womanly companionship here and there, I have pretty much given up on the idea of men and marriage.  I also hate dating and talking to people (especially men) I don't know:\n\nDating in the current pandemic is impossible because you never know how clean he is, what precautions he takes, etc.  Besides that, I am some who values her down time above all else, anyway, and am not suited to be paired imo.  I just don't like constant interaction, need my own bed when I sleep (was a problem in my 6+ long term relationship.

{"author":"Environmental_Bread7","body":"&#x200B;\n\n>In  my time reflecting, I've come to feel that most men are the same. I  feel like if Id put myself out there that ill only end up being played,  even with sticking to FDS strategies. I also know that men are  biologically wired to reproduce as much as possible without being picky  while women are wired to be more selective and get attached and develop  feelings after having sex one time.\n\nI think that's not true at all and just another sexist lie by the patriarchy. I see it repeated all the time, but there is yet someone to explain the biological process of how that's supposed to work, lol (yet alone show evidence for it). Women are told by patriarchy that they NEED to have a relationship\/marriage or otherwise they are useless and men are told that they are the men if they manage to have sex with a lot of women.\n\nPersonally, I think the idea to get attached and developing feelings after having sex one time seems ridiculous to me. Before I went WGTOW, I had a lot of sex and hooked up a lot. Never have I once fallen in love over a hook up. The few times I have fallen in love, it was because of good conversations and because I thought the other had similar values\/an attractive personality. On the other hand, there were plenty of times were men were more interested in a relationship than I was. \n\n> Marriage feels like a scam to me, I feel that a woman looses her  identity to the man and turns into a mere extension of him. Youre no  longer Samantha, the fun yoga loving accountant that paints in a studio  on the side, but just \"toms wife\". I feel like the burden of the  housework falls to you or you're expected to pay 50\/50 for the finances  yet get stuck with way more to do in the housework and errands. All the  women in unhappy marriages in my family tell me its about \"compromising\"  but ive seen firsthand that always means they settle for what their  husband wants, and when he does give in to help her or show up with her  hes bored, embarassing, and such a hassle on purpose so he isn't asked  again. \n\nI agree with that a lot and it's sad to watch. Sometimes you even see excited interesting women loose their personality once they're in a relationship and become some boring copy of their men. \n\n>When  i picture my future I imagine happiness as me traveling, running my  career as a CPA, running my side business\/hobby, working out, and owning  a 2 bedroom house. One room for me to sleep in and the other solely  dedicated to my hobby business. I don't imagine a man, but I can see my  sister living with me and us having a great time together.\n\nSounds like an interesting and fulfilling live.  It seems like you know what you want already. A lot of time it is ingrained into us (especially as women) that we need to date and being coupled is normal. It is not. Being single, being happy by yourself should be the norm. Also, you don't need to become inflexible. If at one point you are not happy wgtow any more or decide you want to date again, nothing stops you from doing so. It's not like we are a cult or a religion. It's about doing what you feel is best for you.","created_utc":1601754878000,"comment_id":"g7icigd","parent_id":"t3_j40pms","score":3,"submission_id":"j40pms"}

They need to be more honest with themselves about this. There are tons of studies to support this - women do more childcare. This is why they get more custody in a typical divorce. And child support is calculated based on income and the children\u2019s expenses and who has them more. You can find these calculators on the court websites if you look.

{"author":"MyDarlingGirl","body":"I upvoted your post because these were some of the same issues I had with FDS but wasn't allowed to post about due to their strict rules against dissent.  \n\nI was on FDS for a while (about a year or so) under different accounts. What you say is true for the most part. \n\nOne thing I feel is not mentioned enough is that \"HVM\" is not a real thing. For a woman, being \"good\" or \"nice\" is often necessary for survival, while for men, it's a choice. Good men make a choice to be good and good men can also decide not to be good with very little consequence (because society doesn't punish them and even encourages some awful behaviors). Also, HVM are just like LVM in that they also want a woman who fits traditional, eurocentric beauty standards. \n\nYou are always taking a gamble on a man, in my experience. He could be settling for you and you wouldn't even know it. \n\nAnother issue is the selling of false hope. Let's be honest. A lot of women on that sub will NEVER get a high value man. Men (yes including the supposed HVM) don't like women who don't conform to a very narrow set of guidelines. And \"high value men\" are especially stringent when it comes to this. I've known really kind, generous, successful \"HVM.\" Guess what their wives look like? Usually very conventionally pretty who lean conservative in their dress, appearance, and lifestyle.  HVM use their status to get what they really want. \n\nLet's just accept that there are some men AND women who are going to be fucked over by evolutionary biology. Nobody said \"natural\" was perfect. This is the natural way of things. Majority of women attracted to a minority of men. Some will lose out or have to settle. Unless they don't want to and then they go WGTOW (like me). \n\nI do thank FDS for making me finally be WGTOW. If not for FDS, I would not have even realized that my issues with heterosexual relationships were not unique.","created_utc":1602564710000,"comment_id":"g8mm7rr","parent_id":"t3_j9v98a","score":30,"submission_id":"j9v98a"}

They can\u2019t learn emotional empathy through good upbringing. \nTherefore it seems the common lack of emotional empathy seen in men also can\u2019t be fixed by good parenting\/upbringing; it is biological.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what is most true or not, but\nFDS seems to only allow comments they believe is true, and there is no discussion if you disagree.","created_utc":1602574994000,"comment_id":"g8n4o6q","parent_id":"t3_j9v98a","score":12,"submission_id":"j9v98a"}

For example she told me if I wanted a baby I would have to get married.  HAVE TO. It would be subtley implied in her tone that I might want to rethink the whole baby thing since a man came with it. \n\nI am pretty sure the reason women center men is because of men demanding to be centered or they will quickly find a woman that  will.  They can always easily find somone who will center them after all.  Women are shamed into getting a man and threatened that they will be a cat lady. But what the ladies really fear  is that they will be the object of ridicule. Because being a cat lady in itself isn't horrible.  It's the not having a man stigma that is horrible.\n\nMost cat ladies  are married and their husbands sometimes complain about the cats. I know because I met many cats ladies volunteering and also in my family we got ladies with far too many cats, but all are in happy relationships.   This whole cat lady rant might be slighly off topic. But mostly the world is full of women so terrifed to be WGTOW even if that is their true hearts desire. \n\nYou could raise a WGTOW but if you do, prepare them for the cruelity society wants to heap on them.

I think those also exist, and participants in this sub might also espouse separatist-feminist philosophies, but mostly this sub is here because \"women who aren't in a relationship and also don't intend to get into one\" are an underserved group on reddit, and in life. And also, it was an easy way to both identify the group for women who were looking for MGTOW-but-for-women, and also to gently satirize.\n\nWhich is to say, I don't know if you can be \"truly WGTOW,\"  because WGTOW is kind of not a real thing, as best I understand it.  And even if it was and you could be \"true WGTOW,\" I don't know that there's a meaningful distinction to be made between actively choosing to be one, and just not choosing to be something else. I think a lot of us here just kind of never got around to committing to that kind of relationship, which suggests to me that we have in common some apathy or ambivalence toward such relationships. It's kind of like a lot of childfree people: it wasn't so much that we were anti-baby, it was just that we never wanted one so badly that we actually had one.\n\nI think if you're a woman who is navigating life independently, and anticipates staying single (barring life-changing events,) then you're in the club, such as it is. If it means something to you to identify as WGTOW, cool; and if it's just a way to find like-minded women in similar circumstances, that's cool too. \n\nJust my opinion, others may disagree.","created_utc":1628119175000,"comment_id":"h7oq906","parent_id":"t3_oxu4c3","score":43,"submission_id":"oxu4c3"}

{"author":"mcove97","body":"Well, I never really wanted to get married, have a house or have children, not cause I had bad experiences with men or anything, but simply cause it's unwise to be legally tied to someone as it can be costly to break up. I can't just break up with them and walk away if things don't work out and we are married, I have to file for divorce and be allowed the breakup by the state, which is messed up. I do not want to be controlled by the law. I just do not want that kind of legal entanglement, and watching celebrities divorces being blown up in the media, it honestly seems dreadful. Not only that, but a house is also very expensive and I want to live that on the road lifestyle. I'm playing with the idea of travelling in a van or having one of those tiny houses on wheels someday. It seems a lot more cost efficient, as someone who cares about what's practical. Owning a hole ass house isn't practical or pragmatic when I get bored of the place I live after a few months. I like to move around a lot. Then there's kids... Well, what do I even need to say, the childfree sub basically lists all the reasons why I don't want kids, from losing my freedom to not wanting to destroy my body. Essentially I am what you would call a hedonist. I like the sweet pleasures of life, and the fun and spontaneity that I can do exactly what I want when I want. I love being free of responsibilities. The only reason I would take on a responsibility that requires work is if I get paid well in cash to do more carefree things. The responsibility of children would be a drain on my wallet not a gain to it and not a gain to my life either.\n\nAs for being relationship with a man that isn't marriage, I'm open to it, and I do want a partner in life, someone to join me on my journeys, but I don't see it happening considering *I'm not like other girls* half joking half not, but I've never really met any men who truly understood me. I'm spiritual, I'm vegan and I'm childfree, which aren't exactly traits I've found in Scandinavian men. I don't want a traditional relationship, but where I am, most men are traditional, in the sense that they all love meat, they're either hardcore atheist or hardcore Christian and most of them want children, a house, a fancy car, wife and a picket white fence someday, which just ain't for me. It's led me to date a lot of guys internationally, like an Asian guy, a Spanish guy, a Syrian guy and a British guy, but nothing worked out cause everyone is just.. Too different from me or too ordinary, like they don't have deep thoughts on things, or they have misguided thoughts on things. I find myself being way more reflected, knowledgeable and opinionated than the guys I met on a lot of topics that are important to me. They've been very one dimensional. I just want to date a guy I can have long philosophical talks with all night while we get high and smoke weed in our van and go skinny dipping, and if I can't have that, I still want to smoke weed in my own van and go skinny dipping and all the other things I love to do, even if it's alone.\n\nWhat made me go my own way? I questioned all the things that people do, from getting married to having children, to owning a house, and I realized people are  just doing it cause everyone else is doing it, and I didn't want to be a sheep, I wanted to rather be a lone wolf. I wanted to do my own thing that made me happy. As for life goal? Enjoying my life to the absolute fullest.\n\nWhen this pandemic is over, I'm gonna dance my ass off at drum and bass music festivals, I'm gonna fly to Greece or Spain and go on a long ass vacation, I'm gonna party, I'm gonna swim in the ocean and I'm gonna live my best life.","created_utc":1619074715000,"comment_id":"gvdqh8x","parent_id":"t3_mvby56","score":12,"submission_id":"mvby56"}

{"author":"warinmymind94","body":"See what services are available in your area: can you order groceries online and get them delivered\/pick them up? You can even order meal kits and groceries online that get delivered in the regular mail rather than from like a delivery boy. \n\nIf you do leave the house, first of all look and dress however you want - ive been sick and gross looking with messy hair, pj's, and no makeup and still would get hit on, so just dress however you want - the thing is dont make eye contact with people as much as possible. Like when you're shopping and theres other shoppers focus your gaze on the products around you and just keep walking. Sometimes guys try to compliment me and stop and try to talk to me, but I literally laugh like hurr hurr and keep walking. I was in the grocery shop for less than 10 minutes today and THREE men approached me. They don't know what to do when you keep walking, just act like you on a mission and you can pretend to not hear them as well. \n\nAnother thing is if you do have a question when out and about, ask an employee rather than a random shopper. You can find a woman that works there and ask her. I would also get approached a lot by men coming up to me and thinking I worked at the stores when I was wearing a sundress that of course didn't look anything like the employee uniforms. Its their way of playing dumb and trying to have a convo. I just look at them dead serious with a REALLY?! Look of disgusting and not amused on my face and I keep a serious tone, I kind of keep my voice a little deeper rather than having the fake nice higher pitch customer service\/polite tone and say in all serious \"I don't work here, I don't know.\" And walk away. Some will follow you and ask more and just ignore them. One was real creepy and I saw an employee and was like \"I told you I don't work here,  theres an employee you need to ask him.\" Be \"bitchy\" be firm be \"rude\" so to speak don't smile, don't apologize. \n\nAnother tip that can help deter them is headphones, you can wear them even if they aren't playing music, but wear the big obvious ones people can see. It won't stop some guys, but in my experience it helps deter them. \n\nI also invested in a home gym!

Accept these thoughts, acknowledge they are there and then let them go and move on. \n\nIt's also good to be conscious of the fact that random thoughts do not necessarily represent who you are as a person, or even your wants or needs. E.g. many people have thoughts like \"what if I just move the steering wheel a little and crash into that truck\" while driving on the highway. Those are completely normal and most people don't *really* want to crash into the truck. In fact, there are theories that many mental illnesses are based on taking one's own thoughts too seriously. E.g. people with depression might have thoughts like \"nobody likes me\" and believe those thoughts to be true.

{"author":"la_zarzamora","body":"What keeps me from getting involved with men is prior disappointing experiences with them, and having financial\/career goals that kind of make getting into a relationship at this point in my life even more of a challenge than under normal circumstances (I want to be a long-haul truck driver which really isn't conducive to much action in the romantic\/sexual\/domestic sphere). \n\nThat being said, when I was your age I would not have been able to \"stick to\" a WGTOW mindset, because I was still young and hadn't had the experiences that taught me that men are not the answer to all my life's problems. It's one thing to hear this intellectually, it's another thing entirely to comprehend it deep in your heart and soul because you've learned from experience. When I was 15-25 I thought ~love is all you need~ and was more interested in relationships than in finding a career or getting my shit together. But really I was just avoiding responsibility for taking care of my own needs and subconsciously expected to find \"the right man\" to fulfill me - this was and still is the way my mother lives her life (she's 56 and on her third husband now) so I didn't really grow up knowing any better. After finding that *even the healthiest relationship* I had been in during that 15-25 period failed to be the perfect union that would make all my dreams come true, I decided to devote some serious time and effort to myself to build the kind of life I want aside from any romantic entanglements. I've been single and celibate for 2.5 years now and feel more \"myself\" now than I ever have before. My individual interests have flourished, I learn new things every day, I've accomplished things I never thought I would, my social life is better than it has ever been, I live in a great apartment, and I'm in better shape health and fitness-wise than I was when I was in relationships. \n\nI don't hate men, in fact I have several good friendships with them, and would be open to a partnership if the right one came along, but my standards are much higher than they used to be, and frankly at 31 I'm getting too set in my ways and life trajectory to want to hook up with just any guy that shows a passing interest. If I gave up my single life it would have to be for someone truly amazing who is naturally harmonious with me and wants the same things I want in life. This mindset makes the pickings much slimmer than they used to be, but to me that's okay because I'm doing my own thing and don't want to be blown off course by some rando who wants me to fit into *his* mold of what a girlfriend\/wife should be.\n\nAll this to say... you don't need to force yourself to be WGTOW if you don't truly \"feel it\" at this point in your life. Maybe you should date around, have fun, fall in love, get your heart broken a couple of times, and perhaps you'll find your way back to WGTOW naturally. But then again, maybe you will get lucky and find a guy who accepts you for who you are and lets you do your own thing, and grows with you as a person. You are young and still discovering who you are. You don't need to chain yourself to anything that stunts your exploration and growth, whether that be a man or a particular feminist philosophy.","created_utc":1624860644000,"comment_id":"h399w0z","parent_id":"t3_o94h2b","score":18,"submission_id":"o94h2b"}

{"author":"sstena","body":"I just realized you only wanted to know the meaning of the acronym. So FDS stands for Female Dating Strategy, if you want to know what the sub is about, I explained below but is beyond what you asked for:\n\nThe core tenet of FDS (female Dating Strategy) is that there is an actual strategy (ie. steps to follow) to making sure you can only possibly end up in a relationship with a man who will add a lot of value to your life. There is no guarantee you will, but you'll also build a life that is worth living without a man by your side, which is part of the strategy.\n\nThe other part of the strategy includes many old and traditional ideas like the man should pay. FDS explains to you the why of each and every tenet, the reasoning behind this one is that if men can have dates for free, they will date as many women as possible without paying attention to whether they're compatible or not. Thus you may end up dating a man who feels quite cold about you.\n\nIf you only go out with men who pay, you're forcing them to be choosy and thus think twice about whether they want to date you, if they do then it actually means they like you a good deal to decide to invest money into getting to know you.\n\nIf a majority of men only dated women they actually liked then this wouldn't be necessary. But since that's not reality, this particular strategy point helps you quickly weed out men who aren't that into you when dating by setting the standard that they either pay for a proper date or they don't date you.\n\nSo HVM means high-value man, yes. It refers to a man who doesn't just add a little value to your life, but rather adds a high amount of it. It is meant to be personal, so a man who adds a lot of value to my life might not add that much value to yours. All HVM share basic traits like respect and empathy but things like height, class, and many other factors are all different.","created_utc":1605315197000,"comment_id":"gc60jl6","parent_id":"t1_gc5thk0","score":21,"submission_id":"jtfnjb"}

Marriage was a like business contract. You created children because you needed them economically. For sexual pleasures there were specific women on the side (rich wives also got their male servants for that purpose).\n\nWhat you call \"romantic love\", a deep, friendship-like connection based on trust and intimacy, men often experienced with other men: the fellow soldier, the business comrade, the sailor, the sports buddy. The ancient Greeks were more blunt about that: romance was between men, women were accessories to create babies.\n\nSo the whole fiction about true love, marriage, and babies is very young.

Men have audacity to constantly tell their wives how fat they are etc. while those men aren't usually fit either. And also there is this running joke where men joke with their friends about how they hate their wife??? I don't understand it.\n\n\u2022 I haven't met any man I can imagine my life with. I don't think I can imagine it at all...\n\nSo here are my reasons.

{"author":"EssentialIrony","body":"Probably going to echo everybody but some of my personal reasons not to get married:\n\n* I've never wanted to.\n* Sounds horrible being \"stuck\" with someone who you'll likely grow apart from eventually. Also seems like it's a lot more difficult to part ways when you're legally bound together.\n* Seems wasteful to spend money on weddings and so on.\n* I enjoy having my finances and everything separated from other people.\n* Marriage seems like an archaic institution that only benefits men. I don't see the point in legally binding people together like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus reasons for not being in a relationship as a whole:\n\n* Not being \"responsible\" for regulating most men's crippled emotional intelligence.\n* I don't want children. Including adult man-children.\n* I don't want to be a bangmaid.\n* I am an introvert and appreciate my own company and time. Never giving that up again.\n* Avoiding all the drama and sociopathic \/ pathological behavior of most men.\n* I can do whatever I want, with my own money, whenever, wherever and with whomever at my own leisure. Nothing beats that.\n* A full, restful sleep without someone hogging all the space and snoring in my face.\n* My own apartment with MY stuff where I want it, how I want it. Not having to deal with someone else's noise and mess all over.\n* Not having to deal with in-laws who dislike me, vice versa.\n* Not having to deal with a spouse's miserable friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeed I go on?","created_utc":1679445688000,"comment_id":"jd3oh05","parent_id":"t3_11p0rx4","score":8,"submission_id":"11p0rx4"}

I am not sure I chose not to have a relationship, I am just completely uninterested on it. Usually the men I like do not like me and the men who like me are not my type... But I am not even sure I would be able to like them for more than a couple of months. I just don't see a lot of advantages in a relationship, it's just adding more drama and complications to life.

{"author":"Environmental_Bread7","body":"Some of these are not just about marriage, but relationships in general:\n\n\\- I don't like the idea of having one \"most important\" person in my life, whom I should make more sacrifices for and spend more time with than my friends, as well as being more emotionally connected to them. \n\n\\- Usually, I get along better with women than men, but I'm heterosexual. \n\n\\- Typically, it's expected for the woman to make more sacrifices in a relationship. \n\n\\- Many other sexist gender role ideas. Even if you find a guy who doesn't subscribe to it, the people around you will, and will judge you for things they wouldn't judge a man in the relationship. \n\n\\- I don't like to share my money and financial planning.

She worked part-time only if at all while he had advanced his full-time career.

(Not to be crass but just an example) when two people have sex if one person doesn't have an orgasm consistently throughout the relationship that would be deemed as bad sex for them,that doesn't make them a transactional oritented person in the negative sense  cause they aren't obligated to serve their partner. Its more even if it is seen through a transactional lense because both sides get something instead of just one side benefitting. I usually hear this being called 'mutually beneficial' but thats also been co-opted by people that are manipulative so I don't like using that term. If you feel great around someone all the time and they make you laugh and feel smart and sexy and they see you for you, you are getting something out of it,you are getting joy,recognition and appreciation which most people need (and of course making them feel that way) I just think its a little disingenuous to say that looking for those emotions in a relationship isn't also looking for a transaction because if they made you feel ugly,stupid and unwanted you would be in the right to leave,the same way if a job that you were working refused to pay you after working for them. \n\nI think I'm getting caught up in semantics perhaps though,I just wish people could be more open and honest about the function and transactional nature of relationships cause I think it would do good for people to define their expectations and roles (not in the traditional gender role sense but in a very personalized sense that makes sense for that person and the specific relationship and dynamic the parties involved have)","created_utc":1694841707000,"comment_id":"k0r5q6o","parent_id":"t1_k0qxz77","score":9,"submission_id":"16jm6uk"}

{"author":"INANNA-ISHTAR","body":"We live in a patriarchal world and as such women are made to obey males' demands. It's a dangerous mix of pornified, hypersexualized patriarchal society and misogyny, whether internalized or not, with a gigantic pressure to conform. It doesn't help the situation because most of the media is owned by men and such they promote toxic agendas when it comes to feminity because they know the masses are influenced by the media.  \n\nAny attempt to change the status quo is met with huge opposition while men can pretty much reject anything, including following basic hygienic practices under \"don't tell us what to do\". Case in point, Gillette was met with \"don't tell us what to do!!!11!!\" while women are supposed to look like models 24x7. \n\nWomen, otoh, are socialized to put the needs, especially of men, above their own and to forfeit any control they have over anything including their own bodies. \"But men like that\" is enough of a reason to shut a woman up but god forbid a woman asks for something or says \"but women like thar\", then she's a (insert all the slurs) who needs to change and re-evaluate herself. \n\nCapitalism that feeds off of female insecurity makes billions from, but not limited to, make-up, plastic surgery, clothing and other stuff associated with feminity and women deserves to be blamed as well. Women are forced to buy stuff and it's even enforced by laws. Example, women in Japan are mandated by the law to wear high heels at work, knowing well that excessive use of high heels can cause orthopaedic issues but it's obvious that they don't care. \n\nPatriarchal bargain is another factor that prevents women from leaving toxic situations. They even end up advising other women because they've been benefited from it and want others to benefit as well. \n\nTargeting na\u00efve and impressionable women, who may or may not be minors, becomes necessary for implementing a cult like scenario out of which there is no escape. You're doomed if you follow (with severe health issues), you're doomed if you don't (with social ostracism). \n\nEverything that's natural in men like beard, body hair etc is celebrated and accepted and everything that's natural in women like periods, cellulite, body hair etc is deemed gross.\n\nWhen you see the situation from this perspective, it becomes apparent that *feminity is ritualised submission*.","created_utc":1610301638000,"comment_id":"gir1u4i","parent_id":"t3_kubajq","score":51,"submission_id":"kubajq"}
{"author":"sstena","body":"To me it is not surprising at all that many women are interested in these two areas (beauty and gossip) because 1) it's pretty much the only two spaces they are allowed to inhabit without much interference from men and 2) those two areas are inherently valuable.\n\nBeauty is social capital, the more beautiful you look, the more benefits you have socially (it's called the \"halo effect\").\n\nGossip teaches you about the social dynamics of power so you can apply them in your own life to the best of your ability, and to maximize your own benefit.\n\nThose 2 areas are devalued by patriarchy because they are mostly populated by women. Men care about gossip too, you know. They just value it appropriately and call it politics instead of a negative term like \"gossip\". But it is the exact same deal.\n\nAnd don't get me started on sports gossip. This player did this, he said that, the manager said this other thing. All gossip. The reason women's gossip is devalued is because anything women do or are interested in is devalued by misogynistic and patriarchal societies. When men do the exact same thing they call it a different name and portray their thing as valuable and women's exact same thing as unvaluable. It's misogyny.\n\nWe are also encouraged to surveil and snitch on each other constantly. And those who do this obtain a couple pats in the head from the men, but internally they are in agony. I don't know a single woman who tears other women down who is genuinely at a place of contentment and inner peace. It's usually the contrary, and she is usually in a relationship with a man who exploits her.\n\nTearing other women down creates internal turmoil and breaks down sisterhood externally. It is the perfect patriarchal move, so it is sold to us as the way to obtain happiness. It's hard to blame girl children following these \"teachings\", and when they become adults it becomes their responsibility but they still come from a place of brain-washing patriarchy and misogyny.\n\nFinally, many women purge their pain and traumas with self-harm and eating disorders, so there's that too.","created_utc":1610330349000,"comment_id":"gis6gsg","parent_id":"t3_kubajq","score":23,"submission_id":"kubajq"}

{"author":"twirleygirl","body":"As with anything in life, you have to decide what you want, decide what you're willing to give up to get it, and live with your decision.  \"Having it all\" is a myth.  \n\nHere are some key aspects to consider in building a fulfilling life:\n\n* **Personal Values:** Identifying what truly matters to you is the first step. Do you crave intellectual stimulation? Do you find joy in nurturing relationships? Understanding your core values helps you prioritize and make choices that align with them.\n* **Work-Life Balance:** Finding a balance that works for you, not someone else\u2019s definition, is crucial. This could involve flexible work arrangements, negotiating childcare responsibilities with a partner, or even taking a career break if needed.\n* **Support Systems:** Building a strong support network is essential. This could include family, friends, mentors, or even childcare providers. Having reliable support allows you to delegate tasks and create space for yourself.\n* **Self-Care:** Prioritizing your own well-being is not selfish, it\u2019s essential. Whether it\u2019s exercise, pursuing a hobby, or simply getting enough sleep, taking care of yourself allows you to show up fully for all aspects of your life.\n\nThe idea of \u201chaving it all\u201d might be a myth in the traditional sense, but that doesn\u2019t mean women can\u2019t achieve a life filled with meaning and purpose. By focusing on your own definition of success, setting realistic expectations, and building strong support systems, you can create a fulfilling life that is uniquely yours.\n\n[https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/living-forward\/201512\/how-get-what-you-really-want](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/living-forward\/201512\/how-get-what-you-really-want)\n\nIt may also be helpful to know that before I had children (1 biological, 1 adopted-'cuz I was NOT going through pregnancy\/childbirth again!!), I didn't truly understand that raising another human being was so all-encompassing: The amount of time, money, attention that children require is staggering!  Your life\/wants\/needs\/etc. go on the back burner for at least 18 years!  Parenting, by definition, places focus on the well-being of your children.\n\nAnd although our bodies change over time in the process of aging, having children changes your body in ways one just can't fully anticipate - your mileage may very ;)\n\nBest of luck to you in figuring out the best life path for YOU!","created_utc":1727985921000,"comment_id":"lq4h5dj","parent_id":"t3_1fv4pm8","score":30,"submission_id":"1fv4pm8"}
{"author":"ImYoGrandpaw","body":"Honestly, I would reconsider having them. You\u2019re going to have to jack your body up, force a kid to exist, and spend your limited youth (20+ years) being a background character in your own life just to spend all your time raising the kid that didn\u2019t ask you to birth them? It\u2019s a scam. Couple that with WGTOW and it\u2019s even more difficult because you need the male to create the kid but then don\u2019t want the male for anything else which can cause conflict, depending on how you facilitate that desire. Do you have a group of women that can help you raise this kid? What if the dad wants to be a part of their life? Just too many obstacles and no reward. \n\nThe reality is that giving birth is to the detriment of women and you either birth the oppressor or the victim. Why gamble with a child like that? You have to take a look at *why* you want kids. Then ask yourself are your desires really worth it.","created_utc":1727992641000,"comment_id":"lq4yizb","parent_id":"t3_1fv4pm8","score":72,"submission_id":"1fv4pm8"}

I do think it's also important for them to interact with men in a healthy way at some point. But it's up to you to decide how and when that happens. \n\nIn particular, fostering older girls who might have had bad experiences with men in their previous households would be a really great thing to do.

The German men I meet here in my country are quite a workful, and the young ones around your age range, oh boy. Very focused on partying and going after  women for hookups. They are very straightforward and focused on what they want so wouldn't be surprised if they're rude to you if you don't have or don't want to give them what they want. So maybe that justifies your difficulties.\n\nNot that I can offer an alternative group of men that is better. Americans and Canadians seem better (because things like metoo movement emerged in the US, and overall gender issues are more discussed there so I guess those men have more exposure to that and some understand some things are not ok) but I am sure most sisters from this sub will have lots of experiences that prove otherwise. \n\nI don't have any advice. A good relationship is better than being single they say, but I wouldn't know that. At this point I think I am not capable of trusting or loving men at a romantic level.

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"I feel you, I used to think I could create my family with friends. But friends always put their families (siblings, parents, partners, kids) above friends, so it didn't work for me. As soon as they got a boyfriend he became priority. \n\nThen I started thinking I would need to have a partner to have that feeling. That is of course until I found out that relationships nowadays are not like my grandparents relationship that lasted 40+ years. Apparently people get into relationships nowadays just to pass some time and not with the idea that it's going to last. So I have a hard time investing in someone emotionally if I know that it's going to end in 1 or 2 yrs. Whats the point really?\nBeing chilfree also sort of complicates things because most guys will stick with you if you have a common purpose (kids) but if you don't want to have kids they might not take you serious as a partner. Also much easier to break up if you don't have common obligations together (kids, common house mortgage, etc).\n\nOn the other hand I am not sure I would be able to have a long term relationship like my grandparents. My grandfather wasn't abusive or a cheater. They both worked hard, saved money to build a house, don't rememeber seeing them fighting. When my grandmother died, my grandfather was heartbroken, didn't find out anyone else and honestly I think he was just waiting to die to rejoin with my grandmother. But it does take a certain kind of personality that my grandmother had and I probably don't. Most likely something that was not a problem for her, would be for me.

That's why relationships, even homosexual ones, are such a losing prospect for women.  Yes, they might feel like they've \"succeeded\" if they get married and have babies by age 30-35; however, when they reach middle age, the chances of them ending up divorced and poor are *extremely high*.  Aside from nearly always being the primary parent, they often lose out on promotions and better pay because they follow their spouses.  When they get divorced or if their spouse gets sick and\/or dies, they often find themselves in poverty because they don't have the second (or only) income.  Family will suddenly disappear or give them the \"bootstraps speech.\"  As for friendships, they won't have any of value, as they tossed them as soon as they became pregnant in favor of fellow \"mommies\" or \"couples\" who couldn't give a toss about their circumstances.  \n\nMoral of the story: be your own spouse.  That's who will be with you at death.","created_utc":1622437984000,"comment_id":"h00ixt1","parent_id":"t3_no8kx8","score":17,"submission_id":"no8kx8"}

We only have a limited amount of free time so you have to distribute it along the people you love, obviously, and naturally there were moments in which I did not spend, let's say, a weekend with my family or friend to spend it with my partner. As there were times I did not spend the weekend with my partner, in order to use that time with my parents or friends, or just on myself.\n\nThere is indeed a strange habit among many women of placing their lover above everything else, and - lollll - that's a terrible idea. When I was younger I definitely made the mistake of placing a boyfriend above myself but I saw pretty quick that I should not... Since then myself, my parents and my sisters always have my loyalty before any lover. \n\nBut I think believing you should be someone's priority \\*\\*always\\*\\* is a bit of a naive idea... That's just not really feasible for most people. I have friends, for example, that if I called them 4am asking for help they would absolutely leave their partners in bed and come to help me - but those friends would rather take their partner in a cool vacation trip than me. And that's okay. I don't have a person (other than myself) in my life who's an absolute priority but I still cherish, listen, spend time and money on everyone I love. This type of dedication you talk about (assuming I'm understanding it correctly) is rare and it is, indeed, usually reserved for spouses and children.","created_utc":1622414541000,"comment_id":"gzz8tni","parent_id":"t3_no8kx8","score":9,"submission_id":"no8kx8"}

{"author":"Bumble_bee_yourself","body":"I was watching a romance movie the other night and it was lovely to see how the male character was portrayed as thoughtful, committed, caring, and absolutely in love and loving the female character. As in, he was making his actions in the world about her.\n\nWomen often do this for men. Women will make their actions in the world about their husbands and children. \n\n\nThen I thought about men.\n\nMen have been taking advantage of this for decades now.\n\nMany of them don't seem to love women or a woman.\n\nThey seem to want sex. More and more of them are addicted to porn. Many of them are unfaithful, just for sex.\n\nThey aren't being taught that their path in life should be to find a woman and build a life with her while they love her deeply and truly and consistently take great care of her.\n\nToo many of them just establish a relationship with a woman (they don't even marry any more) and then use her up while also cheating on her and using up other women, in addition to jerking off to porn way too much and playing video games.\n\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWere men always really like this or did it change?\n\nIf it changed, why did it change?\n\n\n\nI don't know if there is truth to this, but sometimes I wonder if giving men access to porn and casual sex has corrupted them, like power corrupts.\n\nPeople value what is hard to obtain.\n\nIf men actually had to work hard to earn a place beside a woman, if they actually had to work to earn her company and intimacy with her, while not having access to porn or casual sex with other women, maybe they would:\n\nvalue their relationships more\n\nvalue love more\n\nvalue intimacy more\n\n\nIf interactions with women were placed in a higher category of value, maybe then we would see a shift towards a man actually feeling deep and committed love for his partner.\n\n\nEither way, it can't be both.\n\nEither both sexes have to be raised to pursue their own best interests and solely their best interests, or both sexes have to be raised to pursue deeply committed and loving romantic partnerships where cooperation from both partners is contributing to the success of both.\n\nIt is wrong to banish an entire sex to be used up by the other.\n\n\n(And that definitely means that women should not be taught that their only purpose is to find a husband and make a family. Statistics have shown that she is going to be damaged for that arrangement, having less happiness and dying sooner. Spinsters may have always had it right.\n\nI know that I am capable of tremendously loyal, compassionate, and enduring love. What I have learned from my experience and from others is that far too many men fake it at first and then stop faking at some point. Or that their reasons for being with a partner are literally as shallow as valuing her appearance and what she does for him. They will often trade her in for a younger model like one trades in a car.

{"author":"SnotNoodle","body":"Sexual selection means that women have the priviledge to judge critically between potential mates. Women have evolved to be picky because of the big responsibility that comes with becoming pregnant, then nurturing the child etc. Men help too, but the primary care has almost always been provided by the mother. For this reason, women felt the need to make sure they were mating with the right man, and they have therefore evolved to be picky. Men have evolved to compete for this very reason: so that the male can win over a female. The competition between the males would sometimes be physical (i.e. they would fight), sometimes it would be done by virtue signalling (i.e. Look at me! I have more money than him) often times, women preferred men who were more aggressive for hunting reasons, as opposed to those who weren't good at hunting. Aggressive men made not only better hunters, but better protectors to the woman and her children. Therefore, in order to succesfully win a woman over, competition between males was necessary, they did this in the ways I described above. This is what has lead for them to be a lot more aggressive than women. It is pretty much a fact, I can link you some articles on sexual selection if you want to give it a read.","created_utc":1503942207000,"comment_id":"dm88d49","parent_id":"t1_dm873t6","score":5,"submission_id":"6srgol"}

{"author":"cruelfeline","body":"You don't cope with an unmet need for external validation. You eliminate it. \n\nIt is, in my experience, never a good idea to require that level of external input from another human being to feel satisfied and happy with your life. Human beings are unreliable and frankly often dangerous; just take a quick glance at any relationship sub. Or like... read some papers. Look around. See how many instances of abuse and cheating and misery exist. See how many women get older and find their man chasing a younger model. Or, for a really delightful statistic, see what happens when women get chronically ill. Or pregnant. \n\nPeople can \"choose\" one another and just as quickly unchoose. There's nothing particularly special about it. \n\nI know that I am special to someone: myself. And that is far more important than being special to some rando who may one day decide they don't like how I chew my food and break it off. And besides: why is it more important to be special to some rando than to oneself anyway? They're not any better than I am; why would I value their opinion more?\n\nOnce upon a time, my old therapist told me that humans require connection and a feeling of belong somewhere. I declined that concept because I could not and cannot stand being around other people for too long, and I did not understand the loneliness people felt during, day, COVID lockdown. It seemed fake to me. Like a joke. He told me that the connection doesn't have to come from other humans; it just has to be there. For me, that connection involves nature and birdfeeding and seasonal change and the non-human world. And that removes the need to feel \"special\" to someone else. \n\nI would never depend on someone else for, say, my financial security. So why would I depend on them for my emotional security? \n\nIt's far better to obtain that from other sources, rather than depending on a human person; they don't have the best track records.","created_utc":1714620954000,"comment_id":"l24zs7i","parent_id":"t3_1chtv4h","score":92,"submission_id":"1chtv4h"}

LOL  Those are human emotions. Just accept them, acknowledge they are there and that will take power from them. \n\nBeing part of a collective effort is also a good strategy. If you do volunteering or are part of a movement or political party, then you become a cell of a larger organism, you become part of something bigger and somewhat small stuff stop mattering as much.  Just look at nuns, how they can live an entire life without romance or sex. why? because they're part of something bigger, specially the missionaires. Whist I am not religious, I admire that.

{"author":"Sailor_Chibi","body":"You sound so miserable OP, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a huge introvert but I kinda get what you mean. It\u2019s very easy to be jealous of people in love who prioritize each other (or at least that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work). When you\u2019re single you obviously have to prioritize yourself, but goddamn does that get tiring sometimes!\n\nHonestly from your comments you sound really unhappy with your work, and I wonder if you\u2019re overthinking this because you don\u2019t want to over-focus on that? Sometimes it\u2019s hard facing the root cause of what\u2019s truly making you unhappy. If you could resolve your work dilemma, I think you\u2019d have a lot more time for other things that make you happy. \n\nI perhaps understand what you mean by external validation better than some. I\u2019ve written fanfic for almost twice as many years as I\u2019ve been alive (started when I was 12, am now 35 (good lord)). And I have a small YT channel. I get validation from comments from both and it\u2019s a really good feeling. Is there something like that you can pursue?\n\nI also have a couple of good friends through fandom and we message somewhat regularly (some through tumblr and a couple through discord). They\u2019re good emotional support even if they can\u2019t be there in person. Having someone who GETS IT is so, so important. No one gets the single struggle like another aro-ace person who doesn\u2019t want a relationship, ya know? \n\nAlso if it makes you feel better, I\u2019m an aro-ace virgin too haha.

{"author":"Chiss_Navigator","body":"Obviously, there is something worth addressing if you feel \u201cintense shame\u201d about not developing certain feelings for people. It\u2019s like getting mad at the sun for rising or the tides for coming in. You probably already know that, just figured it couldn\u2019t hurt mentioning it again.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m 30 years old and also \u201caroace\u201d (I kind roll my eyes at the terminology but go with it for the sake of communication in conversations like this one). No sexual experiences, same as you. Haven\u2019t even been on a date before because I\u2019m simply not interested.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the relationship hierarchy is the way it is, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t continue investing in relationships that matter to you. Even if you do, like I have, the result might not be what you\u2019re hoping for.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve arrived at a point where I\u2019ve accepted that there are various chapters to everyone\u2019s lives. You and I are at the part where most of our friends are getting married and\/or having kids. I don\u2019t resent them for it. I keep the lanes of communication open. I get to know their husbands because I\u2019ve determined that me remaining part of their lives is somewhat contingent on these random men enjoying my company.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI figure if I\u2019m going to stumble into a life teammate situation with anyone, it\u2019s going to be later in life. I\u2019m not on the young love expanding to a family with kids trajectory. I\u2019m on the solo adventure which just might throw me in the path of someone who gets me or would be interested in getting me. Who isn\u2019t confused by the idea of a friendship being a relationship of value and significance.\n\n\n\nBut you have to understand that this is rare. Even more rare than a successful romantic relationship because there\u2019s a whole societal infrastructure built to pair people up in that sense. Few ever think to talk about friendship. Life is going to look a lot different for anyone not following the script. \u00a0\n\n\n\nLike you, I have a job that keeps me busy. I\u2019m on the road most of the time somewhat because I am a little afraid at being home, falling into a routine, and just being by myself. I need things to stay interesting. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a roadie doing production for concert tours living on a bus most months of the year. I come home, see my friends living their lives on the one evening a year I can be penciled in, then I\u2019m jetting off again.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI know this probably isn\u2019t the best way to cope so recently I\u2019ve been investing more into personal development. Getting back on my hobbies (writing stories, playing piano, putting together my first apartment, finding work locally that could evolve into something longterm with more hours).

That fantasy of the perfect life that could be found with a romantic\/sexual partner (with the eventual children) does not exist. We all are not immune to the propaganda of \"get married and have babies if you want to be successful and happy\", so what you have to do is look at the reality of relationships.

I've heard enough horror stories of couples, particularly with women, and how much bullsh\\*t they have to endure with their partners to put me off.\n\nI would suggest finding a therapist to work on the issues which manifests as a desire to be desired, find an aspec community where you would find people with similar experiences to you, and count the blessings that is afforded to you for being single.

He would respond by calling me a jealous dyke. She eventually married him. \n\nConversely, when I was quite a bit younger, I had a crush on and began hanging out with this guy named Corey. He seemed to return my feelings, but was still somehow holding back when he was with me. I finally asked him why this was, and he admitted that he still hung out with his ex girlfriend sometimes, and that he still had feelings for her. He specified that they weren\u2019t necessarily romantic together, but they were \u201ccuddle buddies.\u201d \n\nI had actually met his ex girlfriend through mutual friends, and I really liked her. I will admit I was hurt, and I probably should\u2019ve ended it there, but I was maybe 19 years old and I really did like him and I thought, eventually, he would choose me. \n\nNeedless to say, he did not choose me and continued to enjoy having one finger in each pie, so to speak (I don\u2019t mean that sexually, as I never had sex with him). \n\nI did end up hanging out more with his ex girlfriend and a genuine friendship started to blossom.

{"author":"forherlight","body":"I'm so glad you posted this, as I've been thinking about this a lot over the past few months. \n\nOne of the things we lack as a sex class is a sense of class consciousness and effective organization. Men don't like it when women organize, so organization has been suppressed. While all of that sounds political, I'm finding it translates to our current social life. For example, women will often pull away from their friends when they become partnered. Then they throw big bachelorette parties and baby showers as sort of a \"last hurrah\" to see their female friends before a man takes her away from her identity and community entirely. This may sound like an exaggeration, but the longer I live, the more I see it. I know I'm preaching to the choir here.\n\nWe really need to get better at organizing and raising consciousness (if you doing know what consciousness-raising is please check it out, as it was a huge part of second wave feminism and is part of our legacy IMO). Part of that is simply finding women who are already living similar lifestyles. That's your question, and that's my question--where are they? Having an effective way to signal to each other that we live a similar lifestyle is helpful, and as another said, before \"WGTOW\" it was \"Spinster,\" but the latter had an extremely negative connotation. There are also female separatists, but separatism has a larger political connotation than WGTOW. \n\nThe fact that WGTOW is named after the horrific male \"MGTOW\" may be making our lifestyle sound less inviting. This alone could put off any woman who is familiar with what MGTOW is. And those who are less \"online\" might be put off by the acronyms altogether, even if they are living the lifestyle of a WGTOW.\n\nAll of this is to say...I think we might need a better name for this movement. One that doesn't mirror something men have already \\[poorly and destructively\\] done. I also think we should be consulting older women who went their own way about this and building a sense of community with them. I definitely have met older women who have lived this lifestyle out in the wild. Perhaps we should ask them what they call themselves, and if\/how they were able to get to know each other. And if they didn't know others like them, let's at least learn from their mistakes.\n\nMany of us have a lot to say about the three-letter podcast-which-shall-not-be-named, but they certainly organized well. They made it a whole brand. Just women giving advice to each other, all with a common goal. They did effectively build a community, for a time. Sadly, their downfall was that they built it on the internet, and in particular, on this horrible website. Women who have decentered men entirely will benefit from forming community with each other offline. Maybe some of us need to bite the bullet and start women's groups in our cities that meet regularly. They would need to be organized and exclusive, with each member vetted. \n\nOr maybe we need to call ourselves Spinsters, live our best lives alone and proudly, and hope we run into others along our journeys.","created_utc":1659686332000,"comment_id":"iizk4au","parent_id":"t3_wfav3c","score":7,"submission_id":"wfav3c"}

{"author":"UnluckyBrilliant-_-","body":"I am a few years older than you and not firmly WGTOW yet, and I think that's okay.\n\nBut I do believe that it is a very real possibility that I chose to spend my life alone atm. For me it is very empowering for the following reasons\n\n1) I know I would not end up in a relationship just for the appearance and social value. Every women in my life who is in a bad relationship didn't want to end up alone. Now, going through emotional abuse, they wish their partner would leave them alone.\n\n2) I have learned to enjoy my own company and learning more and more about myself every day. The amount of fun that a woman can have by herself is one of the best kept secrets lol. I mean I do not support incel like mentality. I have friends from all genders that I adore and enjoy spending time with. But at the end of the day I know there is one person who truly has my back and that's myself. \n\n3) Finally, knowing that fear of ending up alone wouldn't make me beg for men or suffer through things that I shouldn't have to suffer through, it is a peaceful thought. \n\n\n4) Edit: this might be exclusive to me but I do prefer to die alone. I saw my grand mother pass away infront of me in incredible pain and I was never the same person again. I honestly do not want my loved ones to watch me die. I would be more at peace knowing I am saving them the pain. \n\nFor me WGTOW is not necessarily cutting off all men from my life right away, but realizing how my life would continue to be sweet af if I don't chose the traditional marriage and kids route.\n\nRemember, we are on our own journeys and it is completely okay what path you chose as long as you are prioritizing yourself and your own happiness :)","created_utc":1619130981000,"comment_id":"gvg5i6j","parent_id":"t3_mw4yas","score":11,"submission_id":"mw4yas"}
{"author":"immortallogic","body":"Hi sis, first of all you're very young. I would highly highly recommend you spend your twenties invested in education, developing your skills, schooling (STEM if you can), reading and gaining knowledge, and cultivating relationships with strong older women and those your age if you can find them.\n\nWith regards to your mom, that's ok! There is probably a generational gap, but as long as there is love you don't need to agree on everything! Always cherish your mom as you seem to \ud83e\udd70\n\nNow the other thing is that you should rethink what it means to 'be alone'. Just because you may not be married or have kids (btw you can still have or adopt kids down the line without a guy), doesn't mean you're alone. As a single 30 year old, the most cherished relationships for me are those with my fellow female friends who are like my sisters. Society has really done a number in convincing us that if you're not in a hetero nuclear family, you're \"alone\". It's bs that simply reinforces the patriarchy.\n\nNow , I'd also recommend reading, so you can become more confident in your choice. The obvious recommendations are authors like Simon de Bouvier, Dworkin, to help you solidify your beliefs. \n\nBut in terms of coping, I'd highly recommend looking into Stoicism. It's a worldview that emphasizes being virtuous, relying on oneself, and not allowing outside influences to affect you. If you can start getting into Stoicism at 18 I promise you will be ahead of the curve. \n\nFinally and most importantly, learn to enjoy your own company. Go on adventures with yourself, in nature, in the city, whatever. Learn to think of yourself as being WITH yourself and opposed to BY yourself. Become the type of person you are proud of.\n\nYou seem intelligent and thoughtful and I'm sure you will do great. Keep in mind that as you get into your twenties you may feel isolated because that's when young women typically do start to get into more serious relationships etc but don't let that away you. \"To live alone is the fate of all great souls\".

Women are more likely to be things such as politicians, scientists, leader, etc. in less gender progressive countries, solely in order to provide security for themselves and be seen as valuable (and for various other aspects) as opposed to an object for their reproductive ability. Women DO want freedom and respect, but more importantly they want security which they all have different ways of finding, but there still needs to be certain things done in order for women as a whole to find it. It\u2019s more of a subconscious search for women, which proves even more how our culture affects the way we as humans beings act.\n\nContinued:\n\nIt is so easy to bind behind pretty phrases such as \u201clife partner\u201d and \u201cother half\u201d to justify the differences in men and women\u2019s \u201cnatural roles\u201d in society as a way to forcibly make the sexes act a certain way, when in reality, when this happens and there exists such a major power imbalance, the type of culture that enforces this type of view tend to be extremely misogynistic, sexist, and patriarchal. Women being respected for having a womb and their \u201ctraditional role\u201d only, is a great way to make sure women and girls are never respected nor seen as equals within society, and thus, women often feel the need to find a way to gain the respect and freedom needed which can vary depending on the socio-cultural and economic climate of various countries and cultures. \n\nHowever, their careers is ultimately a great way to do so, and thus a lot of women see their accomplishments beyond being wife and mothers to be the true thing that provides them for what they are all searching for; security. That along with financial independence and the guarantee to balance out the what would be, extreme power imbalance that only ever harms women and girls more in these types of countries. Even if female leaders can be misogynistic, it\u2019s still way way better in the long run as opposed to just having misogynistic male rulers.\n\nWomen in more developed countries are able to have equality of opportunity and don\u2019t actually have to feel the need to \u201cprove themselves\u201d or do something extra in order to empower themselves, and instead already live in an environment which provides freedom and security and alone along with the word that they are already smart and capable for being women. This is why women are primarily able to actually benefit from their reproductive ability along with having equal rights, which isn\u2019t a given in various other countries. \n\nMen, as it\u2019s been shown time after time again, don\u2019t and never will and never have respected women for their \u201ctraditional roles\u201d, and thus a culture in which women are seen as good for this only, will only ever lead to oppression and pain and sorrow, and more importantly, retaliation. The more you try to purposely mold women into being \u201csubmissive, obedient, and docile\u201d, the more you push a lot more women away from it. Sexism won\u2019t always make them obey nor submit, but instead toughens them up and hades them to the reality of the world. Why do you think that\u2019s very time there is an attack on women\u2019s rights, women protest and fight back. Any time women aren\u2019t allowed to do a certain job or have careers solely due to their sex, they retaliate and create whole movements in order to get these rights. In developing countries of course, this will be much harder for various reasons and there will always be people pushing back on the status-quo, but like I mentioned again; the quest for freedom and security and power within women varies differently depending on a variety of factors.\n\nMen really be thinking that a country and world where women are brainwashed into being submissive sex dolls will be anything close to decent, but they are sorely mistaken. Forcing anyone to do anything is a sure way to accomplish the exact opposite of what you want.","created_utc":1625707899000,"comment_id":"h4dk06c","parent_id":"t1_h4d8ord","score":13,"submission_id":"ofh2cj"}

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"Well, it depends, I have an auto-immune disease and traditional medicine alone clearly does not have an answer for it, as it doesn't for most auto-immune diseases. I have Hashimoto thyroiditis which causes hypothiroidism. I go to the doctor once a year for blood work and this year found out it deregulated again... it has been stable for 4 years now! Nobody is able to explain to me why all of the sudden it deregulates...\n\nSo I turn to energetic explanations. I moved out of my parents house in 2018, so about 3 years ago. My mental health improved, I felt better. As soon as I get back here due to pandemic and a lesion I had, my thyroid gets worst and I gain weight. Also I had a situation with a guy which caused me a lot of stress and the lesion itself that I had. \n\nAny case I don't know what disease you have... From what you describe it seems chronic. Maybe you'd benefit from a more holistic approach... but please be careful with all the overpriced charlatans out there. I was looking into Functional Medicine because I came up with Dr.Eric Berg and Dr. Mark Hyman channels, but their prices are scandalous and immoral honestly.  However, the contents they post on youtube are helpful.\n\nAlso I should had, I am very pro science, in fact I studied pharmacy and did research in science. I think energetic approaches are complementary to science (I follow the conventional treatment for hypothiroidism which is replacement therapy with levothyroxine) not a substitute. It's just another tool you can add to your arsenal to achieve a better state of health.","created_utc":1624337631000,"comment_id":"h2kv8fz","parent_id":"t3_o54cts","score":10,"submission_id":"o54cts"}

They love women for how they make them feel, what they give to them, what they represent socially. When you regard women as means to something else, how could you truly respect them? \n\nEven if they truly love you, they have so little to offer you. They will never be equal partners and pick up their share around the house, around finances, kids or pets (if you have them). Not to mention sexual aspects. You will end up giving so much and they will suck the life out of you. You will have so little time and care for yourself, and they will mock and belittle you for not being \"how you use to be\". \n\nI believe most women crave romantic love because we have ideals of it in our minds. But the reality is so different than that. And even if you think that you grasp it, it's very difficult, almost impossible to sustain. Love dies, romance dies, excitement and adventure wanes and you're left with a shell of a person, who has no desire and energy to give. \n\nSo yes, give yourself what you need and you will never be disappointed.

{"author":"GlassesForSale","body":"I felt so relieved reading your post. All this time I thought I was alone in those sentiments, thoughts and observations. And the worst part is, I know my view and observation of the world, and all the misogyny in it, is quite accurate. Actually no, the worst part is that the people I know and (from what I see on a daily basis) people in general, don't seem to see it, or just choose to be OK with it. From constant violence against women, rape and abuse and harrassement, that almost every woman experiences at least once in her life for which the perpetrators almost never face any lasting consequences and are even excused, to sex trafficking, to normalization of hardcore pornography degrading and dehumanizing women, to the discrimination of women in the workplace and professional environment, to constant double standards, to women having to work 100 times harder to get the same title or respect as a man, to gender roles which expect women to have fulltime jobs and careers yet still be unpaid maids to their husbands 24\/7, to the fact that men GENUINELY believe they are better than women and it shows in almost every interaction they have with women and of course in the general society and politics as well, to the CONSTANT derogatory language used against women which is now so normalized it's strange when a woman actually gets referred to as a woman instead of some insult or stereotype...  I'm only 24 but I think I'm actually clinically depressed because of it. I see (objective) misogyny in places, actions and things where other people don't seem to see it and I truly believe, based on statistics, surveys and my own anecdotal evidence that the large majority of men is severely misogyinistic and a lot of women have internalised misogyny as well -  and I just can't deal with it. I'm too sensitive for this shit, I just can't accept the fact that I have to live in this world.

For perspective purposes, relate it to systemic racism and varying race issues. Yes, every race will have specific issues based upon their skin color\/culture, but some will have it worse off (things that cost them their life due to something they can't control like race\/gender), than others due to historical oppression and systems in place that were built against them.

I've read that 85% of bisexual women wind up in opposite sex relationships, and I can certainly see why that would happen. You almost have to be intentional about dating someone of the same sex. I've also heard from more than one bisexual man, fwiw, that dating men is exhausting and demoralizing compared to dating women. \n\n>I'm glad you've found happiness now and I hope your daughter is doing well.\n\nShe's doing a lot better now that her rapist is in prison for a long ass time.

{"author":"OrangeBoy79","body":"I totally understand the fear and the feeling of not wanting to rock the boat. I also understand the feeling of not being sure that I could have an emotional relationship with a woman. I always defaulted to dating men because I believed it was easier. It may be somewhat easier in the beginning stages of a relationship, but as we all know that does not translate to easier or better relationships. \n\nI totally understand wanting to keep your OLD profile open to both men and women at first, and I did the same thing for a while too. But I would strongly encourage you to close off your profile to \"looking for men\" and here's why: You will invariably get more matches with men and more attention from men, and it becomes too easy to just fall back on that. I find it to be difficult, mentally, to switch back and forth between talking to men and talking to women with OLD because the strategies you use will be different. Getting dates with men is *easy*. Getting dates with women will almost always require more effort and risk, even if it's just perceived risk. And it's human nature to take the path of least resistance. So your results will be better if you do not give yourself an easy out. \n\nAs women we are heavily socialized from an early age to not be sexually or romantically assertive. All women get these messages and all women are at high risk of internalizing and adopting these norms. Straight women, gay women, bi women, butch women, femme women, it doesn't matter. Most of us have a tendency to hedge our bets, to not show overt interest until the other person is being absolutely clear about theirs. This becomes a problem with WLW because we all play our cards so close to our chest that no one ever makes a move, or if they do it happens at an agonizingly glacial pace. Women are also more likely to be *re*active vs. proactive. What this means is that we are more likely to feel interested in someone if they show interest in us first. But you can use these tendencies to your advantage simply by being more proactive. \n\nThink about what kinds of behaviors men do that make you more interested in dating them. I know for me that is things like showing confidence, showing strong interest from the outset, communicating often, and some light (but not overly sexual) flirting. So let's say you have matched with a woman, you find her attractive and she seems like a good fit in terms of personality. Message her first instead of waiting for her to message you. Tell her she's cute. Ask her on a date. The fact that not a lot of women are very assertive will give you an immediate advantage. \n\nAs far as being scared of wasting some poor woman's time, I hear that, but don't be. You won't feel an emotional connection with most men you go out with either and that's ok. It's fine to take things a little more slowly. An emotional connection takes time to build. If you have gone out a few times and still feel no spark, that's ok. No rational person is going to expect you to know immediately how you feel about them. Don't let this fear scare you out of even trying.","created_utc":1577598257000,"comment_id":"fcahqym","parent_id":"t1_fc9mcx3","score":8,"submission_id":"efkwnq"}

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"Well you can be wgtow and have hookups honestly. Being wgtow means you are independent from men, women in relationships are more trapped to men than single women who have hookups.\n\nObviously it depends on the reason. In your case it doesn't seem it was a healthy reason and it was impulsive but maybe some women really like sex and can have pleasure from hookups and have it once in a while then tell the guy bye bye (not my case but maybe some do). You're still single and independent. You just need to be careful with the guy because he might try stupid stuff off limits like sex without condom, so if you know him minimally its better. \n\nSugaring done ok can be useful. Imagine you have a guy and go in vacation with him to a destination you can't usually afford for like 2 weeks, 1 month. After that you don't have to interact with him anymore, its bye bye, you had fun for a couple of weeks, you're done. Those guys are not good for relationships anyway. Actually more useful than most guys who just take and give nothing. Of course he needs to be minimally decent I can't imagine I'd be able to sexually interact with a married cheater or a Dumbledore grandpa for 1 minute much less 1month.\n\nI don't think sex is freeing for women (and I might be on the asexual spectrum so I am not extremely sexual), but we're animals with hormones in the end who have urges so if you still need sex from men you can find a way to have it and be wgtow. Just make sure you only interact with them for the sex and cut all romantic or emotional attachments. Some women do this better than others I guess.\n\nAlso make sure you do not depend on them for anything. Make sure you have a fulfiling life on your own, a job, financial freedom, projects, goals. If its like that you don't fall into the mistake of ending up trapped to a man.","created_utc":1630874249000,"comment_id":"hboi76j","parent_id":"t3_pgtsh5","score":2,"submission_id":"pgtsh5"}

{"author":"cidazdl","body":"Typically I ignore them to the best of my ability when it appears they're going beyond polite, professional, cordial niceties.  When they start attempting to initiate beyond professional reasons, I'll blatantly ignore them.  Pretend I didn't hear their droning. Act like I thought they were talking to someone else. Walk away mid droning. Say I have something important to do and walk off, regardless of what they say.  If you're not in a position to do this for whatever reason, being disinterested and saying \"Uh huh\" works until you're able to walk off.  Grey rocking works well in these situations.\n\nRefuse to engage in any questions that require personal information that is beyond the mundane.  Ex. \"Any plans this weekend?\" you answer, \"Nope\" and provide no further details. \"Have you watched any good movies lately?\" Nope. \"Are you interested in X hobby?\" Nope.  Anything you can answer no (or some variant of) to, do so.  It sounds like a broken record, but the more boring and casually disengaged you are, the more they'll eventually get bored themselves. Don't give them anything to work with. Usually these questions they ask are designed to get information and try setting up a date or get together so they can have you alone and if you say no, not interested, not my cup of tea to everything, there isn't much for them to prompt with.\n\nFor the \"studying\" guy, for example, I'd say no, I do better when I'm able to actually focus by myself and study better alone and am not interested in group study time.  Cut it off right there, leaving no room for questioning.\n\nThe guy that likes to drop his personal baggage on you, I'd redirect to someone else he actually knows. \"Huh, I'm sure your parents would love to discuss that with you\", \"Yeah, I'm sure your wife\/girlfriend would enjoy you mentioning that\", etc... Not a \"Have you to talked with X about this?\", because that shows interest to them and opens the door to them saying \"X just doesn't care!\".  Instead let them know there is a more appropriate person they could be discussing this with and it isn't you.  If they say they've talked to X person, go \"Huh, anyways...\" and change the topic to something mundane, acting like you just suddenly thought of said topic.\n\nIf they get truly hostile or pissy, its a supervisory or HR complaint.  We don't exist to humor men or their bullshit.

{"author":"Party_Associate","body":"I enjoy a good discussion on philosophy. Its beautiful to peek into peoples minds and see how they get their world view. I rarely talk to women because I'm stupid shy. But I enjoy talking about philosophy with my friends and I wish it came up more as a topic. I gain respect and am impressed by them sharing these thoughts. Seeing the world for more than its surface.\n\nMy best friend said something very similar to this the other night we were at a diner. He lately became impatient talking to people because we was very anxious to move past small talk and move onto more insightful conversation. He couldn't stop thinking about his philosophical theory and wanted to share it with others. \n\nIn the end I realized that that kind of zeal; that kind of aggressive ideology to see just what one's thinking compares pretty well to pushing a religious agenda. I've wanted to talk about philosophy with my family because I don't think its something they ever think about. But I want it to be natural and organic, to get the best reaction out of them.

A couple of women commented that they lost weight and got thinner, I said that was my experience too, except my breasts got bigger... which was the truth. And for some reason I got downvoted, and some women had to make a comment \u201cyuck.

When I was younger, I deluded myself for many years thinking it was possible to establish an equal relationship and authentic friendships with men, but experience has taught me otherwise.  I no longer believe in  sincere friendship between men and women for the following reasons: 1) in most cases they pretend friendship to get sex, when they don't get sex, they show themselves for what they really are. 2) Friendship can only arise between people who respect each other and consider themselves equal. Men do not consider us their equal. Period. I've stopped deluding myself about them, I only deal with men for work reasons and it's more than enough.  I spend my free time happily with my female friends or dedicating myself to my hobbies, which are many, I don't miss the dating thing at all.

{"author":"-badmadAM","body":">that I am the new mother of my siblings, my dad's new wife\n\nThis sounds really wrong if you think about it. You are not your dad's new \"wife\" (ugh) and you have the right to be your own person and think about building your life instead of being your fathers slave. Of course you can still help care for your siblings, but as it seems you and your siblings already do get along and help each other and divide your chores the way they suit you. But you should not be a servant for your dad just because you are a girl (same for your sister), he is the adult and should be more responsible. He is the one who should see how he can provide for his kids and help them get a good start in their life.","created_utc":1611818265000,"comment_id":"gl0k5u6","parent_id":"t3_l6bxs6","score":2,"submission_id":"l6bxs6"}

{"author":"warinmymind94","body":"I am sorry for your loss. Im gonna say this- your dad is the parent and should be the one taking care of you and your siblings or making some type of arrangement (like hiring someone to help or maybe having another relative come help out) so his kids can be taken care of and the house can be running. \n\nIt is NOT your responsibility to become like a wife\/mother\/maid\/caretaker i do not care what the culture says or anything. The thing is women get burdened down by this especially during their formative years and they should be really working on getting their own life and future secured like by getting that first job, building a resume, saving up money, getting your education, etc. When you get burdened down by having to fill the role of a wife\/mother like this, it really makes everything harder to accomplish. \n\nMy advice is do what you can to get a job, pickup extra shifts if possible, and save up what you can. If school is something you're thinking about, do what you can to get in and live at college not at home. While you are at home, I would suggest talking to your siblings and divide up the responsibilities among all of you, to share the burden more. Maybe your younger sister can be the one cooking and folding laundry while you do the dishes and the wash or something like that - rather than having you do everything. Is it possible to talk to your dad saying you feel overwhelmed and have other dreams you need your energy for? If not is it possible to move away and get a roomate?","created_utc":1612095366000,"comment_id":"glg31yu","parent_id":"t3_l6bxs6","score":1,"submission_id":"l6bxs6"}

{"author":"BisexualCaveman","body":"FWIW, I totally support the WGTOW lifestyle choice  and see it as a great choice for many women. \n\nI had a widowed single mom in my family at one point. She realized that men just weren't worth the hassle for her, and has busied herself with work, community and family.\n\nShe is happier than 95% of women I know,  and frankly she is much happier as a widow than she was dealing with her husband. \n\nOf course, from reading my username, you might understand that I don't have a ton of concern as to whether women are a romantic option for me.\n\nThe only part of WGTOW that would concern me is difficulty associated with having kids if it became widespread, but I expect science will solve for that at some point. I doubt adoption will go away any time soon, so I suspect I will always have one option or another for building a family without needing a women 'going with' me.\n\nAs to the guys trying to drop dating advice on you,  WGTOW already owns the best advice out there;  don't be dependent on a romantic partner for happiness or survival. If you can always leave, then you don't need to ever let a man or woman make you unhappy. I respect that some men are dangerous even to other men in relationships, and for that reason alone, WGTOW makes perfect sense to me even knowing every dating trick in the book.\n\nBest wishes to all of you!

{"author":"Nu_Guy","body":"Im on my phone and I have not learned how to quote sections, so I apoligize if this is harder to understand than your reply(which was easy to understand), especially format wise. I tried to answer the questions in the same order\n\nI think in general, men are more addicted to porn because we are visually stimulated and do not have the opportunity to have sex at the drop of a dime. So porn becomes part of the routine for release. Porn is becoming more popular and less taboo for women though, as you are starting to stop feeling ashamed about your sexuality. Thanks in major part to positive feminism.\n\n Maybe men are less inclined to feel ashamed of cheating because of society's mentality towards men sleeping around compared to women, and so they are less secretive\/smart about it, so we hear more about it (just 2 hypotheses), but I see many wives flirting around at work too tbh. I think our standards are generally different but we are more alike than we usually give credit for.\n\nIt is not that hard to not fuck everything in sight because no human does that, and less than 10% of men have the looks and charm to pull anything near that off(likely less than 1%). Are you mostly considering that 10% in your data\/analysis? \n\nAlso like most other news, we hear the bad stories instead of the good ones...Few women come online to explain that their families are going strong, and their husbands have not cheated yet. One weird thing though (in my experience) is that girls value you more when you have a gf, thus actually making it easier to find casual sex. IDK if it excites some of you or what, or maybe you value other girls opinions of a guy.\n\nTBH in 2017 my female friends have had more partners and are far more sexually active than my male friends, it is not easy to have casual sex these days as an average guy. \n\nMost women I know have kids by the age of 40. Simply looking around my office whats visible atm, There is only 1 woman out of about 10 who does not have a kid. So it appears women in general are not fighting those urges.(I just looked it up and it is actually closer to 50\/50 than I expexted. But that includes illness, lost fetuses, and inability to have kids)\n\nUnattractive men are not the only ones capable of being faithful but it is logically easier for them. \n\nAnd of course attraction is subjective, but we don't have the time or knowledge to discuss every womans preferences. So for the sake of this discussion Let's use Channing Tatum as our general attractive example. Imagine what he goes through on a journey trying to be faithful, compared to me...\n\nEdit: Or think of a Brad Pitt; \"My wife Jennifer is so beautiful, but wow I shot this movie with angelina and she shows me and kisses me with so much passion that Jennifer can't. Should I go home and pretend to not be happy for the rest of my life??\" [I am never even put in that situation]","created_utc":1509745753000,"comment_id":"dpadk17","parent_id":"t1_dp9n3fs","score":1,"submission_id":"7a0jnu"}

{"author":"sousayi","body":"Investing $$$!\n\nAnd I don't mean financial skills in general, that's a whole other topic. \n\nI mean making your money grow in stocks (investments), so that it matches your growth into retirement. \n\nWomen generally don't put their money in investments (whereas most men do) because we keep our money safe in savings. But the money can't grow this way. This is a key reason why women have way less money than men by the time they hit retirement. \n\nI honestly struggled with this one because I think capitalism is awful and investments can be so unethical. But I work as a researcher and when I saw the financial stats on single women in retirement it was a huge shock for me. Poverty is a serious issue for single women in retirement.\n\nYou don't have to invest on your own, you can find an advisor who can work with you and your budget (however small it is) and level of risk. Here's where the skills come into place: make sure you understand the basics like the types of investments (ex: government bonds), what a diversified portfolio is, and how to discuss them with an advisor. I found a bank that is a cooperative and now have my investment portfolio and account there. \n\nThe Government of Canada has a page on how to find an investment advisor and the questions to ask. It might help to read even if you're outside of Canada: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/financial-consumer-agency\/services\/savings-investments\/choose-financial-advisor.html#toc3\n\nOne last thing, please please please NEVER invest in crypto currencies & NFTs (bitcoin, etc..).

{"author":"cidazdl","body":"Yes, without a doubt.  Women who worship and coddle men have been so programmed and brainwashed that they see other women, their own, as the greatest threat and interference to their success and happiness, not men.  They excuse the predatory, abusive, dangerous, disrespectful, and entitled behaviors of men at every turn.  They police, harass, and shame other women, assisting men in enforcing the patriarchy.  They have succumbed to the divide and conquer system males have implemented in order to try and prevent women from becoming a united front and ending the nonsense.  \n\nEven more, no matter what happens, the true worshippers rarely seem to ever truly see the light and decide maybe it isn't all rainbows and ponies, coddling and protecting men at every turn isn't all its cracked up to be.  \n\nMost of the women in my immediate and extended family are like this and it is frustrating to say the least.  They see feminism as evil.  They regard women as inherently inferior and useless without men. They've internalized the ridiculous notion that men are somehow mentally and emotionally superior.  No matter how many times they and their children are abused and used by men, generation after generation, they still pledge to protect them until their last breath.  Its absolute insanity to me, but they've been convinced it is the \"good life\", and I rarely see the girls and young women steering away from that ideology.  Its drilled into their heads from childhood, enforced without mercy, treated as normality, those who disobey or question it are ostracized.","created_utc":1618146033000,"comment_id":"gu4bplf","parent_id":"t3_mm2tm0","score":13,"submission_id":"mm2tm0"}

{"author":"Lookingglassgirl9","body":"Most women live longer than men and greatly outlive their husbands.\n\nWhen women (and men) lose a loved one, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to follow especially if they\u2019re older or in poorer health. This phenomenon is called \u201cbroken heart death\u201d and is well-observed.\n\nBut make no mistake, this is due to a *loved one* passing, not just a man, lol. And certainly not any run-of-the-mill husband. Too many women are trapped in unhealthy, burdensome marriages and feel incredibly free once their husbands die. They go on to live full, wonderful lives.\n\nSo no, women are not going to die off because they\u2019re not taking care of men. If anything, WGTOW are going to live longer, healthier, happier lives.\n\nBut don\u2019t just take my word for it:\n\nWomen across the globe outlive men: https:\/\/www.prb.org\/resources\/around-the-globe-women-outlive-men\/\n\nThe benefits of staying single as a woman: https:\/\/archive-yaleglobal.yale.edu\/content\/should-women-stay-single\n\nFrom the article: \u201cA number of studies report that single women tend to be healthier and less depressed, living longer than married women. Single women generally experience fewer stresses and compromises than married women. Furthermore, single women feel more empowered, enjoying greater personal autonomy and freedoms than married women largely because they don\u2019t juggle challenging multiple roles at work and home.\u201d\n\nAgain, if a woman finds a loving partnership with a man, things may be different. There\u2019s exceptions everywhere. Maybe your parents were an exception. Or maybe your mother was so exhausted after taking care of her husband for so many years while no one was taking care of her that her body just gave out. That happens too. The adrenaline of caretaking leaves and what\u2019s left is a husk of a body drained by someone else. Is that love? Not in my opinion. \n\nPersonally, I think every woman should look in the mirror before they partner with a man and ask \u201cAm I the exception? Or am I the rule?\u201d\n\nHope this helps!","created_utc":1662754964000,"comment_id":"inpuw3a","parent_id":"t3_x9sdbz","score":66,"submission_id":"x9sdbz"}

Maybe you don't have to say it's something you've fully decided no on yet, but just keep it vague and as time goes on they will figure out you aren't interested in marriage. \n\nIf you can find role models of Indian women around you who are unmarried\/ child-free and happy maybe you can show your parents there is more than one way to live life? \n\nIn general not giving into society - remember that \"society\" is full of sheep following the herd and they only reason they give a damn about whether you're married or not is because they don't have anything going on in their lives. And in the case if Indian society, probably alot of patriarchy tied in there too.\n\nStick strong to your ideals, and don't allow yourself to succumb to societal pressure because you will probably regret it for life.

{"author":"waterylilies","body":"Hey. I am also from India and also 25. Although I'm not yet being pressurized into marriage by my parents I know it's down the lane. (I'm probably also writing this for myself.) You basically have to make a choice between the two -\n\n1. The wgtow life: It is tempting to settle but  this is *your life*. It is going to be a battle. You will need integrity, courage and sincerity for what you believe in. It's not going to be easy but you will be an example for girls striving for a single life around you. You will be a force of change. There will be no one to dictate you - you take all your life decisions. Society may hate you but you will have self-respect. I'm sure you will eventually find like minded people in our lives (you already have started to;)).\n2. The wife life: society will accept you (not necessarily respect you though) and you will get a lot of other benefits as you mentioned. All your life decisions will be largely taken with the man (and children) in mind. It is goint to be a struggle. You may resent yourself, and you definitely will have the regret of if only I had been brave (But I know how hard it is; no judgements). \n\nEither way you have to choose between two sets of problems. So choose your battle wisely and pragmatically.\n\nIf you choose the first I came across a great advice by a Pakistani blogger [here](https:\/\/inqilabi.tumblr.com\/post\/659543195660812288\/hi-annie-i-dont-want-to-get-married-either-but):\n\n>Anonymous asked:\r  \nhi annie, i dont want to get married either but what did you do to get ur parents to \"hold off\" shaadi when u were done with education? Im in my early 20s but getting a job far away is not an option lmao. idk how u went thru this all these years i can already feel the guilt of how im going to let them down in the future. but also feel like im going to break under the pressure n give in...... anyways! i wish u n ur parents good health p.s. you are so pretty omg...  \n>  \n>\r  \n*Actually the guilt I felt when I was younger was different than the guilt I feel now. At your age I was still obedient & very much concerned with trying to not let them down. Now I am a known disobedient and letting them down is just a necessary feature of the life I chose for myself lol, so it\u2019s a bit different. If you are going to do a masters or any further education or training, make sure you do it far away. I think as you add distance, your relationship with your parents changes. Otherwise you\u2019ll have to carve out your resistance in their space & that\u2019s very difficult to do. It\u2019s doable imo if your parents are isolated, don\u2019t have a community which acts as enforcers, or your parents get old, they lose stamina & can\u2019t pressure you. Having your own money also helps, it helps when your parents know that you can leave & just get an apartment any time. So you being able to be financially independent is still of utmost important if you can\u2019t move out.*\r  \n\r  \n*I think I told them no off the bat for proposals when I was 22-23 or so as they had started looking but they pressed me to see them. So I entertained many proposals & just kept rejecting the proposals for many years.*\r  \n\r  \n*If I can do it, you can too \ud83d\ude0a*","created_utc":1629152911000,"comment_id":"h95sii2","parent_id":"t3_p4mjwu","score":3,"submission_id":"p4mjwu"}

Wait a while, learn who you are, stand in your integrity, fight the tradition for traditions sake line then go after what you want and what makes you happy. You parents will be unhappy and upset that you've decided to shun their wisdom but it's your life, you only get ONE. They'll tell you you'll make mistakes without them and you will. Some big some small, but you learn the lesson and keep going and every lesson you learn helps you uncover and grow into your unique being.","created_utc":1630527103000,"comment_id":"hb6exsu","parent_id":"t3_p4mjwu","score":1,"submission_id":"p4mjwu"}

Your temporary embarrassment. Let's say the Indian Student Association let's you know that your mother called. You can respond, \"it's unfortunate how comfortable my mother feels embarrassing herself in order to embarrass me. She thinks I never plan on marrying anyone. She can be very dramatic.

Men are afraid of us, which I find egregious because if you look at the statistics of murder and rape, WE should be the ones fearing them. Another problem is that they feel entitled to sex, the \"nice guys\" especially. I don't even feel like escalating with men or talking to them, because I don't want to put myself in a position where I can't leave or can't say no without fearing for my safety. Especially someone who's twoce my size and physically stronger and can use it to their advantage during intercourse (ie rape). So I'd rather not engage with them at all. Even as \"friends\" they're parasites; give them a little pity attention in any form and they'll try to sink their claws in. I had to be mean on purpose to get rid of one lol.

{"author":"Winter-Union2801","body":"Non-GTOWs usually make romantic relationships and families as their purpose in life. GTOWs don't have the luxury of doing so, so it generally requires us more soul searching to figure out what is the purpose to our lives.\n\nThe general purpose itself is to live life as best as you can. What is best is then based on your opinions and ideals. For example, most people's best life is fixated on building a family of their own, having wealth, so on and so forth. What could yours be? Is there something beyond your work and hobbies than you feel you need to accomplish in life? Mine for example is rooted in spiritually - I would like to achieve peace, be a master to my emotions, let go of attachments and hopefully help others once I am able to heal myself. \n\nWhatever your purpose is, take all the time you need to figure yourself out.\n\nI will also point out one thing.. it could very well be the people problems\/ disconnect you have that are partially making you feel drained in life. People are on different journeys than us, and sometimes they are simply going to rub us the wrong way for one reason or another. Whether or not you choose to tolerate someone or put distance in between yourself and them, it's important not to let them get under your skin to the extent that it adds negativity into your life. Let go and let live whenever you can, even if it is a problem with others.

You have people renting rooms only for 500\u20ac (don't even mind entire houses lol) while the minimum salary is 820\u20ac but its only 820\u20ac because we had a socialist govt for the past 8 yrs, when they started it was 485\u20ac. They raised the minimum but can't raise the medium salaries and companies can't be trusted to pay fair wages. \n\nWe also have immigrants who come here in hopes for better life and sometimes since they take a while to find a job due to problems with legalization and language they end up homeless. Obviously the right wing is preying on that.\n\nAnd one of my housemates gets on my nerves too because she is one of those fancy persons whose shit smell like roses had this important grandfather but yet somehow is living in a room the size of a closet in her 40s. Well pal where I come from, my grandfather and other grandfather starved and was sent to fight a war from the regime for which your grandfather worked for, so fuck off. If you're so fancy then go rent a house for yourself to one of your rich friends for 1500\u20ac and leave me the fuck alone. My former housemate was from latin america, she moved to Germany alone to study medicine and was here for a semester. She implied my former housemate was not clean, probably because she is latin american and there's some prejudice here against immigrants from there... These people need a reality check, you're 40 and live in a closet in a shared house, some hairs in the bathtub should not be your biggest concern and also seriously you're putting down someone who had the guts to move alone an ocean away from home in search of a better life, like what relevant things did you achieve in life besides creating meaningless problems for others? Fuck off\n\nIts sad because she seems to be wgtow and when I first met her I was excited and maybe we could be friends. Well, no.\n\nAbout therapy I went before but I find it does not work for me.

{"author":"vialenae","body":"1 Yes and no. Simply ignoring it is an easy thing to say, but a very hard thing to do. It\u2019s something I have struggled with and still struggle with to this day. The main thing for me is this: getting angry all the time over things I have no control over does nothing for me except ruin my day so why would I want to do that to myself? Why waste my time and energy on it? So instead, I focus on the positive: whether it\u2019s interactions, people, my pets etc. What I mean is: don\u2019t let it consume you, it\u2019s not worth it and if it gets too much, try to find an outlet or a distraction, hobbies, friends, carreer, things that you love and enjoy. Make yourself and your life a priority, that should be #1 regardless. \n\n2 Acceptance: it will probably take a long time but that was the first step for me to deal with this reality. It\u2019s shit and it will remain shit for a long time still and it sucks. Once you\u2019ve accepted that, you can start to move on.

{"author":"purpleisverysus","body":"I struggle with 1 myself, but what's helping me is understanding that is just out of my control. Men have the physical strength which leads to political strength so myself just like other women won't ever be able to shape the world to our liking. \n\nBut we can create our isolated islands where we live as we like, especially in our age. So I just ignore males. Especially what they write online. I came to realize males would never write anything about women that would benefit our mental health. Their goal is never to help us, but help themselves. Their interests - a servant who serves for food and a roof - run contrary to our goals - being a self-actualized human being, so there is no benefit at all in reading what they have to say about women. It's all essentially male fan fiction, a fantasy version of reality where women are hardly human, submissive dolls with no goals of their own. They'd try to convince you their fantasy is what women really are or should be. They'd label any good thing or quality masculine, so that women become left with lame qualities under the label of feminine. Laugh at them, because that's toddler behaviour, they want to be special so bad it hurts them when they realize women may share their interests and hobbies (then they'd try to deny it) \n\nOf course until a couple years ago I've read a lot of what they said and it helped shatter the illusion. So I guess it's a necessary step, but once you see reality for what it is, it's time to step back and leave them alone. \n\nSo I try to focus on content that comes from other women. Foster friendships with women, etc \n\nAs for 2, you'd need to learn to accept reality.

{"author":"Tired-Thyroid","body":"When you think about it, the vast majority of old people today feel lonely, especially at that age, despite being married or having big families. You hear about it all the time, it's a big problem. Family is not something to rely on for company in the modern world, especially not children and grandchildren, as they have their own busy lives and different interests. There are so many articles and news stories about married people who have been \"left to die alone\" by their families - that sounds worse than being single. \n\nI also hear about so many old people who have no idea what to do with themselves when their spouse dies, because they've relied solely on them to keep the loneliness away. That's what's truly tragic to me. People who have been single their whole lives might, in my opinion, fare a bit better in their old age, because they have learned to keep busy with hobbies and make non-romantic relationships more often than their married counterparts, so in general they probably have more resources to find new friends and activities.\n\nI think loneliness also has a lot to do with the way our society is constructed, leaving very little room for all old people and not having appropriate spaces set up for them to make new connections. Active, social seniors are more of a rarity, no matter their marriage status.\n\nAs a morbid thought, I think most of us die alone either way. Being surrounded by friends and family on our deathbeds is a romanticised dream that never really happens, does it. They lady in the OPs story is more of an exception. Death just isn't pleasant. So it's more about living the (single) life you want before it comes.","created_utc":1679064379000,"comment_id":"jcjcgj6","parent_id":"t1_jcipdog","score":14,"submission_id":"11t8z0u"}
{"author":"saucemaking","body":"It is definitely the way society is structured. I'm not even old old but pretty much beyond college you're told good luck having friends. And then good luck if you don't have kids like all your peers do. Then you're expected to make work friends, which to me is bizarre because to me work is for work, and the truth is you have to change jobs frequently these days. \n\nAnd these past few years I've decided to live pretty frugally, and have been paying down debt. I'm 40, this is not how my peers live on average, it has made people my age uncomfortable that I'm putting myself in a decent financial situation. And since I'm not spending money left and right like they are, people don't want to be around me. It's weird but we really live in a society that is extremely classist and if you don't keep up with spending and consuming you're pushed out. \n\nThere is no actual sense of community anymore either in a lot of places. Towns aren't built anymore, now its overpriced subdivisions built to keep out the poors, with no town center or walkability. I've even experienced the elitism when I walk on trails by those residential areas. \n\nNone of this bodes well for even a middle-aged adult like me, I'm kind of glad that our elders did at least maybe get to experience the tail end of towns still having some community. Even my 80 year old grandma talks about the changes, she still tries to be socially active but it's tough out there and it isn't just because she's old.","created_utc":1679165809000,"comment_id":"jcol6va","parent_id":"t1_jcjcgj6","score":3,"submission_id":"11t8z0u"}
{"author":"Tired-Thyroid","body":"I agree with everything you said. It's depressing that this is what our society has become. We keep forgetting about ourselves.\n\nI think most people actually end up getting into relationships and marriages quickly *because* it's the easiest way to find that sense of community and closeness. If you lose your friends because you're all busy, you can still come back home to your spouse and kids and fulfil that emotional need without doing much. I wonder if those peoe would still choose the same path if society was different? I have a feeling a lot of them might not. If the modern world placed less importance on competitiveness, status, and individuality, and instead focused more on giving us the time and opportunity to build tighter platonic relationships of all kinds, there would be less loneliness and less obsession about getting married and have a family. \n\nSingle people are also almost shamed these days, even trated like failures, which adds to the problem. Since society invests everything into marriages and romantic coupling, intentional spaces and events for singles end up being rare or non-existent.\n\nWork friends have always been a bit of an odd concept to me - obviously there can be people you'll get along there, but most if the time you're only friends because you work together, and when you quit, the connections disappear because the common ground has been lost. They're not true friendships in that way. Same goes for school and college friends. People accept this, but personally I don't find it all that meaningful. I want to build something that lasts. But no one has the time or the energy, and I can't really blame them when work drains us all so much. \n\nTowns where I live often only offer caf\u00e9s for socialising and not much else. Those require already knowing people, and they're not all that interesting. The rest of the buildings are mostly shops.\n\nIt also bothers me greatly that everything is being pushed online, like we're almost forced to have social media so we don't lose friends. Old people are obviously not going to do that. Even I don't want to, it isn't natural and feels superficial. There are countless social apps out there, but not nearly as many real life spaces. \n\nSadly I don't see anything changing in the future, we're drifting further and further away from how we're meant to live :\/","created_utc":1679248520000,"comment_id":"jct0mxn","parent_id":"t1_jcol6va","score":3,"submission_id":"11t8z0u"}

So if you can live off 20k per year then you need to have 500k invested and then you can live without working forever using that 20k to rent a place forever. This is the \"four percent rule.\"\n\nTo be able to achieve this, you must never have children because having children will mean you increase the amount you need to live which means you need to save more, which means you'll never be financially independent.

They would scream that the woman is harpy for even suggesting it. They already decry being \"friendzoned\" and that's someone who's not even their girlfriend!\n\nNumber 5 is a good point too. Men are incredibly selfish when it comes to contraception. They don't want to wear a condom because \"it doesn't feel as good\", but they want you to take hormones every day for decades of your life. How selfish is that? I hope any woman who's having sex without trying to get pregnant will insist on wearing a condom. So what if he whines and complains that \"it doesn't feel as good\"?

Birth control can fucking suck, although your medical facts are only partly correct - estrogen increases your risk of stroke and heart attack and thrombosis (although not nearly as much as pregnancy does, so compared to pregnancy it's better), does not affect breast cancer risk much, and decreases your risk of ovarian cancer.  There are also non-hormonal options (copper IUD, condoms) and progesterone-only options (progestin-only pill, progestin IUD, progestin implant), but your point about birth control almost always falling on the woman is true, and it's often a huge pain in the ass, because of side effects, expense, time, physical pain (putting in an IUD is often painful), etc.  \n\nI think most of your points are worst case scenarios, so they're valid in the sense that they absolutely happen, but not in the sense that they are the most likely thing to happen.","created_utc":1510920090000,"comment_id":"dpxztgd","parent_id":"t3_7dgysd","score":11,"submission_id":"7dgysd"}

A cheery attitude with a nice way of speaking to people makes the meatheads think impure thoughts. They will assume you want them. \n\n- the Mom\n\nDisgusting role that I adopted for awhile. I don\u2019t recommend it. You have to 5x more menial labour without the foreman pay. Everyone will love you cause you\u2019re a door mat. Be a Real Mom - become foreman who delegates while also babysitting bad behaviour. For more money!\n\n- the Gray Rock\n\nNo friends, just business. People won\u2019t fuck with you, but you will miss out on opportunities. \n\nFor social outings I have general rules. Never go out with someone by yourself, always in groups. Never get drunk, always be one of the first to leave. \n\nI know this is WGTOW so don\u2019t flame me for the last one, but NEVER date\/sleep with someone off of a site. Biggest reputation sinker. If the guy blabs you\u2019ll have a hard time with the here to get laid, not to get paid brand. Honestly OP - if you have a easy time with letting comments slide off your back without holding on to them, jump in. It\u2019s been very rewarding for me and as someone who struggles with pure misandry - it helps me humanize men again. The first couple of years were tough to find a spot to be comfortable, but you grow confidence and the attitude that no one will screw around. It really does come naturally.","created_utc":1668143840000,"comment_id":"ivv7xnk","parent_id":"t3_yrf2z6","score":15,"submission_id":"yrf2z6"}

{"author":"slap_dash","body":"This one is easier than you think. \n\nTry to keep on the quieter side. So if the conversation with a group is going where you don't want to go, then just done say anything. Or give short answers. Don't be rude though, you don't want ro be known as rude. But they'll get the message you arent interested in engaging with them.\n\nMake sure you do hold up your end with work. I've heard that some assume women got the job because they are pretty or sleeping with the right person. You have to earn their respect. Just put in the work and they'll notice and that should help your relationship with them.\n\nAs for inappropriate behavior... depending on how bad it is. Just politely shut it down. Maybe even explain that since you work together, you'd rather not go that route. If they don't respect it, personally I just make sparky passive aggressive remarks. Like I actually have a situation right now where some higher levels have made inappropriate Comments and I'll say things like \"what do you mean by that\" or another time one of them made a comment about a top I was wearing and I asked \"would you like me to go put on another shirt\" loudly so others hear. Call it out. You don't want to be the person always running to HR. But if the behavior is egregious then you'll have to of course, but if it's that serious... your co workers that have any sense will understand and the ones who think you are mean will be trash and you'll know it. No one deserves to be treated that way.\n\nAny way good luck. Have a thick skin. Be safe. Watch what you say. If you do stuff with them outside of work, they to make it a group setting... unless you do like someone. Pull your weight. Try to take a logic approach to everything vs emotional - make sure you explain things logically is what I mean. You will be fine.

{"author":"cathwaitress","body":"I\u2019ve also been looking into this. It\u2019s not so much about being alone for me, but self reliant. \n\nI\u2019m always jealous of women who have their act together and just know what to do in seemingly any situation. Car breaks down in the middle of nowhere? They have everything they need to survive and get help. Being lost? Travelling alone. Overwintering a house? That\u2019s what I want to learn. \n\nThey only thing I\u2019ve found so far is dad advice on instagram. Not about loneliness at all. But really wholesome. And focused on teaching (his daughter) all the life skills girls are not usually taught. Like how to change filters in your car, how to change a tire, building simple things, hanging a new light etc etc.\n\nEdit: I know this is not exactly what you asked for. But for me, having skills and knowledge is what makes me feel safe. Especially when living alone. Because I know I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help. (Within reason of course)\n\nI think women are often scared of living alone because \u201cwhat if something happens\u201d. \u201cWhat if a pipe bursts in the middle of the night\u201d. Turns out all of these things are very easy to learn. \n\nAnd when it comes to other feelings of safety, it\u2019s good to have a plan. \u201cWhat if a strange man shows up at my door\u201d. \u201cWhat if there is a hurricane\u201c. Have a plan for what you\u2019ll do and you\u2019ll feel much safer. \n\nOnce you feel secure by yourself you can make a decision on how much time you want to spend with other people.

{"author":"knownda","body":"Being alone and being lonely are two very different things.\n\n\nThe truth is we came here alone, and will go back alone. What is important is we feel complete within ourself...with someone or without someone...the feeling of completion should always be there....\n\n\nOne ordinarily lives in loneliness. To avoid loneliness, one creates all kinds of relationships, friendships, organizations, political parties, religions and what not. But the basic thing is that he is very much afraid of being lonely. Loneliness is a black hole, a darkness, a frightening negative state almost like death \u2026 as if you are being swallowed by death itself. To avoid it, you run out and fall into anybody, just to hold somebody\u2019s hand, to feel that you are not lonely\u2026 Nothing hurts more than loneliness.\nBut the trouble is, any relationship that arises out of the fear of being lonely is not going to be a blissful experience, because the other is also joining you out of fear. You both call it love. You are both deceiving yourself and the other. It is simply fear, and fear can never be the source of love. Only those who love are absolutely fearless; only those who love are able to be alone, joyously, whose need for the other has disappeared, who are sufficient unto themselves\u2026\n\n\nThe day you decide that all these efforts are failures, that your loneliness has remained untouched by all your efforts, that is a great moment of understanding. Then only one thing remains: to see whether loneliness is such a thing that you should be afraid of, or if it is just your nature. Then rather than running out and away, you close your eyes and go in. Suddenly the night is over, and a new dawn \u2026 The loneliness transforms into aloneness.\n\n\nAloneness is your nature. You were born alone, you will die alone. And you are living alone without understanding it, without being fully aware of it. You misunderstand aloneness as loneliness; it is simply a misunderstanding. You are sufficient unto yourself.\n\n\n\n\nWalden is good book to start with..then you can accompany it with works of eckhart tolle,\u00a0","created_utc":1728986525000,"comment_id":"lrz56u1","parent_id":"t3_1g0blz0","score":6,"submission_id":"1g0blz0"}

Another serious problem is between seculars and conservatives.  It is very interesting, but the concept of secular and conservative works quite differently in Turkey than in many other countries.

{"author":"hativerance","body":"The oppression of the Kurds in Turkey is unbelievable.  Their arts, social formations, political movements and languages \u200b\u200bwere forbidden for a very long time.  Of course, this was true not only for the Kurds, but for all minority nations.  I am also a minority, Circassian.  We have suffered the same injustices.  However, the Kurds, especially the Turkish nationalists and state policies, have done a lot of damage in every way.  For a long time, the development of the Eastern Anatolia region was stopped by the state simply because they were not supporters of the Republic.  In my opinion, minorities have advanced a lot in Turkey.  Official state television now broadcasts in Arabic and Turkish.  Elective language courses were introduced in public schools.  But in Turkey, Kurds are still mostly associated with the terrorist organization called PKK (Kurdish Workers Party).  The PKK is not a political party, it is an illegal organization and is mostly made up of socialist Kurdish nationalists.  The PKK is a formation that demands land rights in Anatolia, Syria and Iraq. However, it has terrible actions.  Personally, I am against the direct association of Kurds with the PKK.  I think this is one of the biggest problems the Kurds are struggling with right now.  They were seen as the \"lower class\" by most of the Turkish people.  With the arrival of Syrian refugees, Kurdish issues fell a little off the agenda.  Now everyone tends to see Syrian refugees as a lower class.  The closest example I can give to explain the Kurdish issue to you would be the social, economic and political positions of Hispaic and African American citizens in the USA.  As I said, it's only a slightly similar example, with a very different historical background in most respects.  On the other hand, it is an interesting situation, there are quite a lot of Turks in Europe, Europeans treat Turks as badly as Turks treat Kurds.  It is tragicomic that Turks, on the other hand, should show empathy but completely ignore the situation.","created_utc":1641532480000,"comment_id":"hrjmcsf","parent_id":"t1_hrjhu9v","score":3,"submission_id":"rxkqxq"}

{"author":"electricpapaya593","body":"Nonattachment and don't forget nonresistance. The world teaches you to stop enjoying things little by little, all your life. But it never says so outright, its just constantly scheming to remind you to hate yourself, your affinities, your nature, appearance, \"female habits\" in millions of little individual ways, which benefit men's status, self-confidence, freedom of expression. (Which is really the only reason they have such broad senses of humor\/ success)  I actually don't believe its all just men move up in the world easier, I think its that they have trenchant psychological advantages that women don't know and can't appreciate. Its what's at the center of your pain and anger too though. You learn to fight and resist and postpone your happiness for someone else and you lose the words to describe why. Its just a blinding jumble of too many things but ESPECIALLY stagnation. *That's the point!* I think its in men's best interest for you to get lost in your mind and stagnate. I truly believe most average men want that. I believe its central to their intentions to break you down. So that you never know your higher mind, so they never have to compete. Its part of manipulation for world power and sex. To get what they want from you in some way without having to reciprocate. Even if men would deny it, their ignorance and entitlement compounds exactly what they're denying. So what is the difference? Even if you reject what I'm describing... you probably forget.. the habit  of postponing your happiness( unconsciously becoming fixated on pain and anger)goes way back in your brain. The burden of emotional labor has profound consequences most people don't appreciate and cannot quantify.\n\nI use Buddhist principals like my life depends on it, to escape my head. I'm so much better than I was when I started 10 years ago... Just fyi.. journaling is like pouring jet fuel on meditation. It allows you to map your entire mind. In my experience it is way more important and effective than meditation. Its easier to master nonattachment and nonresistance through journaling because you can program your subconscious mind in exactly a way that benefits you most.

{"author":"loraren","body":"Mindfulness meditation got me through the worst months of the pandemic, a traumatic breakup, and helped me come fully into my decisions to be childfree and a WGTOW. I highly recommend the app Headspace. I\u2019d tried to build a regular meditation practice a few times throughout my life but was only successful after relying on the structured lessons of Headspace. Now, 15 months later, I still meditate 10-15 minutes a day about 5 days a week. It\u2019s a big commitment to set aside that much time to \u201cdo nothing\u201c but it was critical for me to get a handle on my anxiety when I was close to having a mental breakdown last year. Because of my meditation practice, now when a particularly anxious thought arises, I have the ability to examine it instead of letting it take control. I can objectively conclude that anxious thoughts are due to insecurity, uncertainty, low self-esteem, etc then move on.   \n\n\nI believe that mindfulness meditation could help you with your anger and pain. In addition to lessening the intensity of these emotions by viewing them objectively, Buddhism and mindfulness meditation encourages us to treat others with loving kindness - especially  ourselves. When I think back to how I\u2019ve let men treat me in the past, I cringe then take a deep breath and think \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from that experience, I deserve to be treated better\u201d, and can move on much quicker than I could\u2018ve in the past.   \n\n\nI love what you wrote about how the world at large - and particularly media and especially social media - constantly tell us that we\u2019re not enough and we\u2019ll be happy if we finally have or look like X. Buddhist teachings say that desires harm us twice: before we have them we yearn, crave, feel incomplete til we obtain X. Then afterwards either X didn\u2019t live up to our expectations, or if we lose it then we miss it and maybe even grieve it. I\u2019ve come to view sex this way. When you\u2019re first dating someone it\u2019s so exciting but for me it actually produces a lot of anxiety. \u201cWhen will I see him again? Will he call me back? I want to have sex with him sooo badly.\u201d Immediately after sex your hormones are satiated, but after a few hours or days - that wasn\u2019t enough, you just want more! This is the cycle of suffering Buddhism says can best be broken by non-attachment. There are women who can have casual sex and not get these huge crests and crashes of emotion, but I\u2019m not one of them.","created_utc":1626037111000,"comment_id":"h4syisl","parent_id":"t3_ohzhhp","score":4,"submission_id":"ohzhhp"}

That's when its the best thing on earth. You can feel liberated from it too and direct it in really exacting ways. Meditation and journaling help you to achieve that. Anger can be so powerful and purifying. I had an annoying blend anger in the old days though. I hated having my mind controlled through manipulation. I grew up in an angry household. I had to work through it.\n\nI also had ptsd. I think it can get better through subconscious work too, its just about finding those knotted root questions and imagining the way you would like to feel in a situation and programming yourself to react that way instead. Its trial and error\/ finding the right questions. It can be frustrating and take forever.  Especially because your brain will play tricks on you and tell you over and over why the work you're doing will fail. So you have to have a system in place to constantly question the negative. Just recording every little gradual improvement and only focusing on the improvements. If I don't, I end up listening to the noise and get caught up in it.<-- that is the most annoying thing about subconscious programming\/ changing your beliefs. Like someone else said..

{"author":"electricpapaya593","body":"It really depends on what you want to get out of it. I journal 1-5 hours a day depending on how I'm feeling. Sometimes I get obsessed. If I feel mentally trapped by manipulation, depression, my thought patterns, I dig into it until I feel the problem is sorted out, and that thought pattern is no longer controlling me. In the beginning I googled questions a lot, if I didn't know the answer. Especially about subconscious reprogramming \/ intrusive thoughts\/ letting go. I would ask incessantly \"Why am i doing this, why am i doing that\" I can't stand muting myself, diminishing myself, due to someone else's mental manipulation and gaslighting.  I just want to create things without being beleaguered by subconscious programming that isn't mine. I want my art to be real and raw. I used to google things a lot if I didn't know the answer. Sometimes it involved a lot of digging. Most of the time I would work it out in a journal though..  Eventually subconscious programming becomes intuitive \"What are you attached to in this moment and why\" <-- a little attachment can effect your whole day, and whatever you're working on a lot in the long run.

An enormous factor of women getting permanently tied to men is through children and accidental ones at that. The education system does a poor job at proper FEMALE education. It\u2019s too basic and surface brushed. The female species is in control of sex and reproduction but they need to taught that at a younger age much more. Most women realize this as adults. Girls need to be taught that during puberty they\u2019re going to feel a surge of hormones, prompting them to \u201cget bred\u201d for lack of a better term. This is a serious thing. I see 14\/15 year olds on TikTok expressing the undying need for a baby during their ovulation phase. It\u2019s normal yes, it\u2019s the hormonal disposition of most women but it MUST be controlled. \n\nThe amount of girls and women, yes grown women that don\u2019t know how their menstrual cycle works is mind boggling. The thing that they literally experience every month. They don\u2019t know about the 4 phases, 28 day cycle and what it entails, how them being in different parts of their phases affects their daily life! What to expect, how to combat it. So many things. How the world is built and catered  around mens 24 hour cycle. List goes on. Not too mention, the awareness will decrease the female mortality rate from uterus related fatalities. They\u2019d know when something is wrong earlier, inquire more and possibly save themselves etc. \n\nThey need to be made very aware in the most emphasized way possible that, doing such ESPECIALLY for the wrong guy will literally mess up their lives. Young girls have kids with degenerates and end up living a miserable life because they\u2019re forever bounded to that individual. Paired with them not having a great enough competent support system. The people who say it\u2019s not a hindrance or set back are inhaling huge amounts of copium. Girls need to be taught that they are in charge of populating the earth, control it and don\u2019t do it at their expense and demise. Too many female lives end up washed and wasted.

So many programs online are focused on light cardio and when they rarely include a weightlifting section is over focused on exercises to grow the glutes \ud83d\ude43 because of course that\u2019s the most important part\u2026 women deserve to learn to train for functional strength.?\n\nOther good comments here especially regarding sex and health.","created_utc":1684904502000,"comment_id":"jlcasqu","parent_id":"t3_13plvz7","score":10,"submission_id":"13plvz7"}
{"author":"QueenRaflesia","body":"This is an interesting topic. As far as I am concerned, I would like a female education of this kind:\n\n\u2022\tPhysical education: teach girls from an early age all the techniques and sports suitable to make women regain a level of strength and physical ability that makes them able to protect and defend themselves. Teach martial arts and effective self-defense techniques. I followed a self-defense course for two years and found it useful, unfortunately I had to leave because of my personal health problem. I still keep the mindset. In addition to this, in physical education I would include all the teachings useful to maintain good health.\n\n\u2022\tFinancial education: teaching how to manage your money well. Teaching foresight: youth is as short as the blink of an eye, to ensure peaceful adult and old age managing money well is fundamental.\n\n\u2022\tTeach how to manage a house in total autonomy, make small repairs without the need to always call a professional, teach the ordinary maintenance of cars, motorcycles, bikes, etc. Teach also those feminine arts useful for greater autonomy: for example sewing.\n\n\u2022\tWorking on the mindset, in order to promote independence and autonomy. Making young women understand that sex doesn't have to be a life purpose, having self-control is much more important. Highlight the emptiness of beauty models, teach to ignore what celebrities say and do, teach how to form totally free and personal thoughts.\n\nFor the rest, I believe that every woman should have access to the course of study she prefers, science or art or economics or medicine, or whatever. Personally, if I went back I would choose a path that would allow me to be self-employed and not force me to work in a company.","created_utc":1685050083000,"comment_id":"jlk8fxa","parent_id":"t3_13plvz7","score":6,"submission_id":"13plvz7"}

{"author":"Chiss_Navigator","body":"Personally, I've always gotten along just fine with women. I grew up in an all girls school for 14 years and had a blast. Once I got to college, my attempts at connecting with men similarly were brief and unpleasant. Granted I wouldn't say I've had those super close talking to each other daily ride or die friendships but that's also not really what my personality is like. At this point most of my friends are married but we still have the same group chat going on Facebook now in our thirties as we did back in 2008. Life updates typically happen through there. I travel for a living but always try to meet up with friends when I am back home. I guess in an ideal world we'd talk\/share more but I tend to believe that there are different chapters in life and some people feature more prominently in some than in others. Right now they're doing the marriage and kids(?) thing. I've never dated as I've never had any interest. When people said you're supposed to marry their best friend I took that at face value. Evidently, that is not the case. In reality you marry the friend you also enjoy having sex with - to put it plainly. It is hormonally driven so I don't find any purpose in trying to make sense of any decisions made in the romantic\/sexual sphere. \n\nHonestly I think friendship is quite rare and what most people experience are acquaintances usually in the form of colleagues. You having two friends sounds about right. \n\nI write about friendship here (this is the video version but a lot more stuff is on my Substack): [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8DFUFz-Hbuw](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8DFUFz-Hbuw)","created_utc":1746569218000,"comment_id":"mqvxpnx","parent_id":"t3_1kg2ihz","score":15,"submission_id":"1kg2ihz"}

{"author":"Shadowgirl7","body":"I keep an Excel sheet where I register all my monthly and yearly expenses detailed for topics (ex: housing, food, leisure, medical expenses).\n\nWhen I get paid I immediately transfer an amount to my investment accounts and just leave enough for typical month of spending in my main account so I don't spend too much. I also have a small amount that easily accessible for emergencies (but still needs a transfer so not so easy as the money that's available in my main account), I have no credit cards.\n\nI am a conservative investor, so far most my invrestments are in low return but high assurance things, which are basically specific finantial products in my country. With the raise of Euribor which is the index in Europe that decides value of interest rates, it has been good for my savings. I am yet to invest in higher risk stuff like ETFs or company shares. \n\nWhen I do I will start off by a small amount. I am thinking about buying B class shares in Berkshire Hathway which is the Warren Buffett company and\/or an ETF. I happen to somewhat trust Buffett he seems like an old school guy. And I also evaluate his personal conduct. He was married to a lady for lots of years, when they decided to split and she moved away he found a partner of his age, not a hot 20 yo model. He also keeps a modest house in his hometown in Omaha and never moved. He defends wealthy people should pay more taxes even though it's against his interest. He also is not a fan of hypes like cryptos, he likes stability. So I somewhat trust he won't spend my money in cocaine and yatches which is important. Also I read somewhere his shares are like an ETF because he has a very diversified portfolio of investments.\n\nAnyway the rules of thumb I picked up (including from a guy I know who retired early so he knows):\n\n* find a job that pays a lot for your time. The more you make the more you'll have to invest, the more you invest the more return you'll get\n\n* spend little. Minimize consumerism, the planet also appreciates\n\n* spend wisely. Always compare prices and investigate before buying\n\n* avoid credit. Unless you really must, like for example to buy a house or in case of certain countries, for education. I would not advise contracting credits for things like expensive vacations. \n\n* do not invest what you can't lose. This comes from Buffett himself. He says if you're the type who panics if you see the market crashing and wants to immediately withdrawl your money, you shouldn't own stocks in the first place. If you need the money for basic things you'll probably panic so yeah it should not be invested in high risk stuff in the first place. \n\n* diversify investment. Don't put all your eggs in the same basket. Thats why ETFs are good because they have stocks from different companies of different parts of the world and different areas of business. Very unlikely they'll all crash at the same time.\n\n* know the level of risk that's adequate for you. Do not put everything into high risk investments. Put some in low risk, some in medium, some in high. This will depend on how much you can afford to lose. Higher risk means higher return but more chances to lose. \n\n* be pessimistic. This is a personal one. I prefer to be pessimistic and always assume the worst case scenario. Some might argue this might make you lose good opportunities. In my country loans to buy houses have two options: fixed interest rates and variables (well in fact, they don't have fully fixed anymore, its usually fixed for a couple of years then variable). Fixed means it will always be the same even if the rate is increasing but if the rate is low you'll be paying more. Since rates were low, everyone was going into variable. Now the rates are skyrocketing and you have people with their monthly payments doubling. That will be \"fun\" to watch. I would personally probably would have gone for a 5 years fixed followed by variable unless the bank gave me assurances I could renegotiate the rate in case it started going above a certain value.\n\nAlso this one is so obvious I forgot: never give anyone access to your money particularly not a man. Like never. If you ever leave the wgtow lifestyle and get a partner and have a house together at most create a joint account on top of your own account (which should remain yours only) to which you transfer only the monthly amount to cover for common bills which was agreed upon. If you marry, make sure there's a prenup that prevents you from inheriting his debts. I know cases of women with their salaries confiscated to pay for the debts their husbands made and of a guy who was gambling the woman's money instead of paying the rent.","created_utc":1674506069000,"comment_id":"j5jcqop","parent_id":"t3_10ixoj0","score":9,"submission_id":"10ixoj0"}

Yes, over several years I've read finance books, watched YouTube videos and read blogs, but the advice is often confusing and contradictory, and I didn't know how to evaluate all of it.   I decided to actually take a class, and I purchased the Slay the Stock Market course.  The course was created by a female, millennial aged, first-generation immigrant.  She not only explains all the financial jargon using plain language, she also has detailed videos on how to set up accounts with Vanguard and Fidelity.  She does a live Q&A a couple of times a month and I watch each of the recordings religiously, because they give me additional insight into where other women are in their financial journeys and how they are going about being more financially independent.   It was well worth the $300 I paid for it, but I do get that some of you may not have that much money.  A good free alternative is Clever Girl Finance.

How come the first bloody thing they say always implicates I'm being dumb and will be adequately corrected by life? \n\nWhy is it always - well you never know what's coming your way! --  never say never! -- you can't lock the door to your heart! -- you are too young to not have fun!

I don't give a damn about them, I don't waste my time thinking about their personal lives. My time is too precious and I refuse to spend it on stupid stuff.\n\nI've come to terms recently I'm in the asexual spectrum and tried joining two communities on facebook in the hopes of having interesting perspectives and making friends, but I quit within a week.

Do people even acknowledge there's SO MUCH MORE to life than that?\n\nI was honestly pretty excited to go to therapy and sort some stuff I have in mind about my future, but a friend today came up with the same old phrases and I realized how likely is that a therapist will do the same. The idea of paying someone to try to gaslight me into \"opening myself to romance again\" makes me want to puke, and at this point I'm skeptical of finding any therapist who will just respect my fucking wish to living a happy, loving, blessed life while single.

{"author":"mdiver12","body":"I've lived in and done work for these communities, specifically in S. Oregon. Fly Away Home is beautiful and has two residents, but they are both incredibly stubborn and I imagine hard to live with, at times. I spent time working there and those two are so set in their ways it can be exhausting. They bought the land as romantic partners, split up shortly after, and have lived there together since the late 70s. They still bicker like they broke up yesterday.  However, I did have the wonderful experience of hiking through the mountains with a 71 year old woman who periodically needed to stop and push her uterus back in. The water line for FAH snakes through the siskiyou mountains about two miles to a spring box they share with neighbors. When it's dry, bears and other animals bite through the line hunting for water. Side note, it gets super dry in S. Oregon so they do this multiple times per summer. Men haven't been on their land in decades. \n\nThe land I lived on was near Grants Pass and Rootworks (but wasn't Rootworks. I do have friends who lived there with Mountaingrove, though) and we ran the production offices for We'Moon out of our main house. We'Moon employed most of the women who lived there, and connected those who didn't work for them to a larger local community. It wasn't quite as strict as FAH when it came to men on the land- we have a good drag queen friend who visited frequently and also had men who were friends visit, though they were few and far between. \n\nI was able to easily support myself doing odd jobs for other women and lesbians (in particular) in the area. Unfortunately, the location makes it less than friendly to BIPOC. The lack of diversity is noticeable and feels VERY encouraged. It's one reason among many that my wife and I chose to leave the area. \n\nWe still talk about buying a big piece of land and building homes on each corner of it, with a community home in the center. I think the younger generation of women values community, but also has a much stronger need for independence and solitude. Sometimes you don't want to talk about your feelings at the required weekly meeting, but that doesn't mean you're turning your back on your landmates. We've also been conditioned as women to hide our feelings, and that can lead to a whole lot of passive aggressive behavior when living in community. Think someone uses too many dishes when they cook? Let's vote to change the rules about who does dishes when that person cooks because I don't like getting my hands pruny. Have an opinion about how the shower curtain should hang after someone showers? Put it on the weekly meeting agenda, right after \"who ate my raw cashews and spirulina?\"\n\n^these are all actual things that happened in my experience. \nThe answer to who ate the cashews and spirulina was a dog.

{"author":"ProserpinaFC","body":"Thank you for sharing your experiences. Having lived in all women house for 5 years I can definitely relate to your stories.\n\nOne of the reasons why all women intentional communities fascinate me is because it gives Americans the opportunity to actually experiment with ways of living and see for themselves what it is that they want to do. Ultimately any and all freedom of Choice greatly increases the ability to make and accept any choice that is made. \n\nFor example, when I talk to Americans who criticize the nuclear family and idealize a more blended family structure, I often ask them if they've read up on the draw-backs that come from THAT structure, which is largely that mother-in-laws RULE and younger women feel absolutely no autonomy to make choices in their children's lives.\n\nI don't particularly think that any structure is perfect, or doesn't have its drawbacks. We need to protect the elderly, but we also need to innovate without the elderly burdening us with tradition. We need to protect children, but we also have to let go and accept when children make decisions that we don't agree with. We have to be caregivers, but care giving doesn't pay the bills. We all want the five current generations to be treated with equal dignity without sacrificing any of our self-respect. And we have to eat, cloth, and practice hygiene & healthcare while we're at it!\n\nI really wish that there were communities that were closer to the Chicago-side of Midwest!!","created_utc":1621646455000,"comment_id":"gyyqmxk","parent_id":"t1_gyy4ulb","score":7,"submission_id":"nhovb9"}

{"author":"MyDarlingGirl","body":"My regret: deciding to apply to med school and also deciding to attend med school. \n\nI didn't know it at the time but my desire to be a doctor stemmed from really terrible self-esteem issues and self-loathing. I thought going to med school would finally make me feel like I've achieved something great and would make me feel better about myself.\n\nSurprise, that didn't happen. In fact, it made things worse. I didn't have time for friends outside of med school, I have no time for hobbies, and my mental health worsened due to the atmosphere and the insane schedules. I feel like I haven't even grown much personally in med school since I'm just studying and working all the time. I'm emotionally stunted. There are even people in my class who started out mentally healthy who have deteriorated in med school. \n\nMy advice to women who want to go into medicine: really think about why it is you want to be a doctor. Do you want to be a doctor so badly that you're okay with sacrificing huge parts of yourself for it? Would you want to be a doctor if you knew you were going to miss family events or couldn't really dedicate any sort of time to other people or other activities in your life?\n\nTbh, if I could go back, I'd get an LMFT license after graduation and be a therapist making 70K a year.

{"author":"PeregrineMarzipan","body":"Don't take out student loans.  \nDon't be involved with men.  \nDon't be afraid to change jobs if you're absolutely miserable.  \nSave money.  \nDon't get married.  \nDon't have sex with men.  \nDon't get pregnant unless it's via a sperm bank.  \nDon't trust men.  \nValue your female friendships, but be smart about them. Learn to figure out which female friends are shallow and don't really care about you vs which ones will stick with you through thick and thin.  \nWhen it comes to your career, don't believe the BS about \"follow your dreams\" or whatever. Get money. Do something there is high demand for so you can get money. Obviously this doesn't apply if you're independently wealthy. Get money first, then you can \"follow your dreams.\"  \nDon't care so much what other people think about you. Especially don't be concerned one iota about men's opinions of you.  \nRead lots of books by women, especially radical feminist theory. Read Mary Daly, Sheila Jeffreys, Andrea Dworkin. Read about women's history and about women's oppression around the world. Read about male violence. Learn the strategies men use to groom and abuse women so that you can identify them.  \nDon't get into cars with men. Don't think an elderly man will be less likely to be a pervert than a younger man. Don't ask men for directions if you're lost.  \nLearn martial arts. Lift weights. Become physically and mentally strong. Do difficult things. Take cold showers. Go wilderness camping. Learn to be uncomfortable.  \nSpend time in women's-only spaces.  \nTravel. Experience the world.

{"author":"Hmtnsw","body":"Putting a man\/relationship above my career. I made career decisions based on that relationship for it to later fail. 5 years down the drain (but it was a huge wake up call). \n\nNot listening to my family as much. I ended up getting pneumonia because my mother thought I had a measly cold that was actually the flu or something and got worse because I didn't take care of myself properly. Ended up getting lice from a girl that deliberately used my hairbrush and didn't tell anyone she had it. My mother said my dandruff was getting bad because it was the summer time. I could have avoided a full blown lice infestation if I had actually followed my intuition and gone to the doctor at the early stage of infestation. \n\nActually do an internship. I listened to some POS that said I didn't have to worry about an internship because I'm a woman in a male dominate field. It is SO hard to get hands on research jobs because I lack an internship. It is also going to make getting into a Master's program continuing my BS education because of that. It is also making finding a job hard compared to women that have internship experience. \n\nI would suggest to younger women to listen to themselves and follow their hearts.

{"author":"REDDITISMISOGYNISTIC","body":"Tldr stay single \n\nFrom the article: A new study published in Mental Health and Physical Activity finds that when one partner is depressed, the other increases their sedentary behaviors and vice versa. This research reveals the potential negative impact partners can have on one another. Understanding this can help clinicians and individuals take steps to prevent the vicious cycle of depression and sedentary behaviors in partnerships.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends avoiding too much sedentary time due to increased health risks, including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer. Sedentary behavior can have mental health outcomes as well, such as higher anxiety and poorer quality of life.\n\nAccording to evidence-based models, there is a link between depressive symptoms and sedentary time, which can make each other worse. Additionally, there are theoretical models that suggest a correlation between the health behaviors of two people in close relationships, such as romantic partners, close friends, or family members. One such model is the shared resources hypothesis, which proposes that romantic couples share a physical environment and social networks, leading to similar behaviors and moods.\n\nThe relationship between sedentary behavior and depressive symptoms is believed to worsen each other in a cyclical manner. While previous research has focused on the connection between sedentary behavior and depression within individuals, Maria Siwa and colleagues sought to examine how the sedentary behavior of one person in a partnership affects the depressive symptoms of their partner and vice versa; how one\u2019s depression could affect the sedentary behavior of the other.\n\nThe study utilized 320 pairs of individuals (one focus person and their partner) who intended to increase their physical activity levels as a way of managing chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases or type-2 diabetes. The participants had to meet certain criteria, including being in a close relationship for at least half a year, having frequent face-to-face interactions, and expressing moderate intentions to engage in regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.","created_utc":1684965481000,"comment_id":"jlfdmm0","parent_id":"t3_13qmi2h","score":21,"submission_id":"13qmi2h"}

{"author":"Tired-Thyroid","body":"I've struggled with this for nearly all my life. I think most (if not all) women do. I've been able to reduce these thoughts, but I admit it's so ingrained that I have a bit more work to do to truly detach myself from it all.\n\nFirstly, become aware that you have been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth to feel this way. All women have gone through this because our worth in this society is still almost entirely dependent on looks. We're told we're less than if we're not beautiful to make up for our \"deficits\". Naturally, we'll want to improve our looks to get higher social status.\n\nSecondly, understand that beauty companies want you to feel this way. They need to sell you products. You're a target. The more inadequate you feel, the more you'll want to spend. Beauty ads are designed to appeal to that aforementioned desire to improve your status through looks. They promise your life will be better when you're prettier through use of their products by showing you glowy, smiling, carefree faces.\n\nThirdly, analyse where these feelings might be coming from. For me, they were a manifestation of loneliness and extremely low confidence. I was convinced I needed to change myself, mostly improve my hair and skin, and wear makeup and beautiful clothes, to be able to accept myself and be accepted. I thought beautiful people were automatically accepted. But those were bandaids, or crutches I used to temporarily feel good, but it wasn't genuine confidence. I felt terrible without them. They warped my own perception of myself because I felt inferior when I didn't feel pretty. I then noticed every single woman I knew who used these things was self-conscious underneath it all. \n\nFinally, remember that men never struggle with this! A beautiful woman will always think she needs to make herself even more beautiful, while a beautiful man will be enough as he is and admired for looking good naturally. \n\nFor me, I realized I needed to accept my true naked self after a difficult illness. Does it really matter if I look beautiful if I can't actually live my life? Why do I keep thinking about my appearance when I'm literally bedridden? I was looking at myself through the eyes of other people looking at me, if that makes sense. But I was forced to focus on my functioning instead of appearance, and then actively worked on stopping the beauty practices I was so reliant on. It wasn't easy because I was addicted to them.\n\nI started reading more radical feminist material and became incredibly angry that I was thinking about beauty so much, when men never gave it a second thought!\n\nEven if society tells you otherwise, you're actually allowed to look \"bad\". I'm not talking about hygiene or letting yourself go, that's obviously different. Take care of your body. But making yourself beautiful with these crazy rituals that waste your time and money is not required to live a happy life. You could be investing that same time and money into hobbies that will actually help you grow as a person and fulfill your life in a way beauty never will. Your worth won't change, in fact it will improve with your capabilities. Focus on what you can do. \n\nI never thought I'd be able to like myself without feeling beautiful. I like the way I look now, but in a different, natural way. Compared to my glam days I'm definitely very plain. But it's fine, I'm not looking to attract anyone, and I definitely don't need to look attractive for myself.

{"author":"Tired-Thyroid","body":"Sorry, but I strongly disagree with this approach. You're clearly still putting emphasis on outer beauty. You're still focused on appearance and looking prettier, especially with that makeup. Maybe less than you did before, but you haven't left that mindset behind. You cannot genuinely accept yourself the way you deserve if you need makeup to make it all look a bit better. I understand OP wants to move away from this. From personal experience, I can say that as long as you keep these beauty practices alive, you won't be able to properly move away from them. *Men don't need a bit of blush and highlighter to appreciate their features.* I hope you can see where I'm coming from - I used to say the same things and kept convincing myself I wasn't still focusing on outer beauty, but I finally admitted I was. I still get sucked into it every now and them, but try to remind myself it's not compatible with my longterm goals. \n\nAnd I think instagramreality has become a bit of a weird sub. I used to follow it but left and feel so much better. Women there say they condemn beauty standards and expose them, but most are pro cosmetic procedures and even admit to getting them themselves, including surgery. But they also say their results are \"tasteful\" and they're \"honest\" about it, so they don't see it as toxic ... But it's exactly the same because it still propagates unnatural beauty standards and focusing on appearance. Probably not the best sub anymore.

{"author":"cheeryblossomm","body":"I think that's internalized misogyny tbh. Women are 100% pictured to be catty, mean to each other and jealous in western and eastern media. Women are socialized to hate each other (see: \"not like other girls\") because every action they take is seen as ridiculous or stupid in the patriarchy: if you wear make up you are a slut, if you don't you don't take care of yourself, if you have sex with a lot of men you are a whore, if you don't you are a prude and so on. How can a women exist in this system? Some are trying to survive and take on hating other women to be \"one of the guys\". I don't blame them, but they are playing in the game men set up for us. The best course of action is to actually respect each other as individual beings, prioritize women in your life and inform other women. Honestly if you still think that women are biologically programmed to hate each other you still have a lot of prejudices to unlearn. I advise you to read some feminist books: the second sex by Simone de beauvoir, the feminine mystique by Betty Friedan, who cooked the last supper by Rosalind Miles, Delusions of Gender by Cordelia Fine.","created_utc":1651592385000,"comment_id":"i74tobp","parent_id":"t3_uh34kv","score":17,"submission_id":"uh34kv"}

{"author":"PalmTreePhilosophy","body":"Nope. I only ever had that feeling when men were around because of the way they focus on one woman in a group and treat her like a God whilst treating other women disrespectfully or as less-than. Of course those guys said women were mean to each other because that's exactly what the male gaze creates. I wonder how complicit they have been in the back biting they've seen.\n\nThis society encourages women to attack each other for male praise and validation. It teaches girls from a young age that we need male validation and we are nothing without it. It also teaches us that there can only be \"one\" special woman because the other special people in society can only be men and they must be the majority. It's the same for all minority groups. It happens with race when we are told there can only be one black or asian person in a sea of white people or one gay person in a sea of straights. You see it in films, on TV etc. \"One of each type\" of minority. This is the limitation of a singular, dominant gaze that we internalise. \n\nIf there can only be one of \"my kind\" then I am going to have a panic attack if another one of my kind is in my orbit. It will feel like life or death. It's a lack mentality but men don't seem to have any understanding of the world they help create and that they invented. They view it superficially because their interest in women is superficial.\n\nUntil we remove the over-valuing of the male gaze from young girls and women, this will always be a problem. These girls and women are merely trying to survive in a limited world that doesn't acknowledge their value.","created_utc":1652969913000,"comment_id":"i967xrs","parent_id":"t3_uh34kv","score":1,"submission_id":"uh34kv"}

{"author":"immortallogic","body":"I have been traveling for the last 7 years or so, usually solo. I did it first when I was 25 and it changed my life. I learned to be independent, more confident, and more outgoing. \n\nDon't know where you're going but make sure you have things in order, don't pack too much, sort things out like offline Google maps, keep your documents in Google drive and backups to your email and usb and stuff. \n\nMake sure when you travel you have your wits about you, be alert when you are walking around, don't be looking at your phone because it can make you a target. When you walk, square your shoulders and walk with confidence. \n\nBeware of who you tell that you are traveling alone (but also don't limit yourself to not doing things cause you're alone) if you're staying in hostels, have FUN! So many fun experiences to have and people to meet, it was one of my favorite things about traveling abroad. \n\nWhen you walk around especially late at night, make sure you dress well with utilitarian clothes and don't look like a walking sex doll to make yourself a target. And if you feel uncomfortable on a place or situation, LEAVE. You have no obligation to anyone to be polite or anything else. Listen to your inner voice. If you have time I HIGHLY recommend reading 'the gift of fear' by Gavin de Becker, especially since you're about to travel alone for a year. Its a fantastic read. You can get it in pdf for free online. Read it on the plane. \n\nFigure out how you are getting from the airport to your accomodation beforehand. I would suggest taking a reliable taxi or shuttle or something as opposed to a bus - you will have all your stuff and be overwhelmed by being at a new place, so spend the extra money for that first trip.\n\nWhen you walk around don't keep any valuables and keep your phone and wallet in your front pocket. Keep a copy of a piece of ID in your phone, and if you have a phone case, keep like $50 in it, tucked in the back, in case you lose your wallet. Take pictures and email them to yourself of things like your passport, credit cards etc. \n\nAlso take local currency from your home country, don't wait to exchange money at the airport. \n\nIf you are looking to meet people you can use apps like bumble bff or whatever, just beware to be smart if you're using online apps of course. \n\nIf you're traveling to a place with a different language you can also download google translate offline. Would suggest Getting set up with a sim card right away so you have communication and directions all the time. Learn the local 911 number. Talk to locals or hostel\/hotel staff to find out which areas you should stay away from, go on some walking tours to discover the area, bit also just explore on your own.... Choose a direction and just walk. \n\nHave a TON of fun and make the most of it sis!!!","created_utc":1650345994000,"comment_id":"i59d7bk","parent_id":"t3_u5kqai","score":2,"submission_id":"u5kqai"}

That's the whole point - we all are not of the same mentality. These disordered types, and there are a lot of them, get off on hiding assets and having their men-friends enable huge financial abuse with the aim of destroying the woman who rejected them or they have discarded. The women know they are getting x% of only *part* of the asset pool they helped accumulate. The court ignores all of this. \n\nDivorce is a huge cash cow for lawyers and judges, a vendetta weapon for those rejected men and a cruel final humiliating act for the discarded women. \n\nWomen rarely get any wins from the legal system around divorce. My rule of thumb is if I hear a guy telling jokes about how much money their ex made, I walk the other way and never speak or have anything to do with them again - it speaks volumes about their thinking and attitude to women. \n\nIt's no surprise to me the woman featured was ill with chronic illnesses - many women who are with bullies get these because of him. These guys (and 90% are male) are toxic on so many levels and never stop trying to destroy the ex, using children and money as weapons.

I've watched chubbier friends eat nothing but nutritious whole foods and thinner friends pack away a whole container of cookies in one sitting, yet the thinner one would be the one viewed as the epitome of \"good health\" and \"taking care of yourself\".\n\nIn my own case, I may have fit the ideal, but I ended up getting diagnosed with celiac disease a few years ago. I was severely malnourished and my body was falling apart. Not getting enough nutrients does way more damage than people realize. I may have looked \"healthy\" (read: thin), but I was the farthest thing from healthy. \n\nEven after diagnosis, I started searching online for the best ways to gain weight, because I was still struggling to put weight on and *everything* that came up was about how to *lose* weight. I even started getting dieting ads on my social media pages. Here I was, actively searching for ways to *gain* weight and *everything* was telling me to lose it instead. I can't imagine trying to recover from an eating disorder and having to fight against the mental hurdles that come with that only to be repeatedly inundated with diet culture like that.

I\u2019ve also found it to be super helpful to focus on the women in your life. From women as important to you as your mother to random old ladies that need help in the grocery store. While men typically don\u2019t care about women that they can\u2019t get anything from, almost every woman in my life would be willing to help me if I needed it. This tends to ring true with women who are strangers as well. A few months back I was in Ulta and a woman tapped on my shoulder and told me that a suspicious man had followed me in. A woman I\u2019d never met in my life cared enough to make sure that I was safe. THAT is why it\u2019s important to lead a woman-focused life.\n\nGood luck to you!

I have a wonderful father, uncle, guy friends who are like brothers. But it's the men I end up with\n\nNo, actually IT IS ALL MEN. There are 2 kinds of men - men who are assholes against women and men who let other men be assholes against women and do NOTHING about it. You can meet a 100% nice guy and yet he will never relate to your problems as a woman and he will NEVER defend you or stand up for you when you face sexism, which doesn't make him so nice in the end.\n\n Your boyfriend sounds controlling and a momma-boy AS HELL. He gotta be unnerving. I'd probably dump him as well.\n\n >I have no sex drive anymore.\n\nIt's alright. Set yourself free from the social programming that says that women are sexual creatures design to embellish the world and please men. THEY'RE NOT. We're not supposed to have sex or to have sex drive just because SOCIETY thinks we have to. I have ZERO sex drive nowadays and I don't care about it. I feel ZERO attraction towards men nowadays and I am super okay with it, I feel LIBERATED to be honest. You're just fine the way you are, and by not having sex you won't have to fill your bloodstream with cancer-and-thrombosis inducing contraceptive hormones and won't have to risk getting a STD either. \n\n > I am going to get the balls to dump this guy and be voluntarily single for the next few years.\n\nListen, if you feel even SLIGHTLY \"meh\" about some guy, it's because it's not working. And I see many red flags in his behavior. DO YOU. BE YOU. Care about YOU because he's not gonna do it on your behalf. \n\n >One day, in the future, maybe I will find one of those mystical nice men.\n\nPerhaps, but don't live your life expecting that. Today it's the dark ages for those women who believe in real love and romance. There's no space for real love and romance in a pornfied culture with porn-addicted, rape-programmed men. \n\n >Everyone I ever dated either undermines my problem, turns it around and makes it about them or accuses me of being ungrateful.

Capitalism means patriarchy is profitable. Just as it means racism and other identity-based oppressions are profitable. I think the correct answer is not either-or but both\/all--if you have intersecting marginalized identities (in this case, if you're a person who lacks both class privilege and sex privilege), one is not more important than another. Class consciousness without taking this into account is reductionist, and the opposite fails to materially accomplish anything because you miss the forest for the trees. For example, through this lens, you can see how repro rights are being rolled back so women can exit the work force to give men back a competitive and economic advantage in an increasingly service-based as opposed to physical labor-based economy and simultaneously compel women to make more babies to feed the machine. You can see the forces of both patriarchy and capitalism at play here--subjugating women and making more money for the ruling class.","created_utc":1711133323000,"comment_id":"kw0zai5","parent_id":"t3_1bgwrxr","score":7,"submission_id":"1bgwrxr"}

{"author":"runningforthills","body":"I completely relate to this! I mostly do things with my single friends now. I feel like a lot of my friends are becoming coupled\u2026 Or have been for a while. It was easy when I had a boyfriend. It's not just couples wanting to do things with other couples, but groups of couples too! Lately I feel like I'm the only one who's single\u2026 and then people feel sorry for me or don't relate to me. \n\nI also really relate to what you said about people basically ditching you for their partners. I have found that if my single girlfriends are interested in someone or dating someone, they will completely neglect or ditch me, even if we had plans. With one friend last Halloween I assumed we were getting together because we often do, but then she prioritized some guy who has used and abused her many times, but they are \"still friends.\" I was so bothered by that! I ended up going on a date I didn't want to go on just to have something to do on Halloween. I also know if my friend is single that I'll be there when she asks to do things, including concerts like you mentioned, but if she's not, I won't see her for months unless I make the effort. We've been friends for almost 2 decades, so it's not like somebody I would just drop for doing something like that, but my point is\u2026 I'm just realizing how society only really respects people who follow their perfect little path. Single, divorced, child free, disabled, unconventional people are just shit out of luck. \n\nI think something important to keep in mind though, is that friends are definitely different than partners and the amount they're willing to do for you. In the amount they're willing to show up. There are definitely lower expectations for friends than partners. So a lot of people with partners just put more energy and effort into it for that reason. Someone who is partnered already has a lot of support, so they're not looking for that elsewhere. And then when a single friend comes and needs more support\/advice\/time because THEY don't have a partner to offer that, then the partnered person might get a little bugged or bothered. i've come to realize that this isn't necessarily a fault\u2026 It actually kind of makes sense. I am lucky to be fairly comfortable on my own and not need someone around me all the time, otherwise I'd be bugging my partnered friends a lot more often. in the end though, I think I will need that to fit into society and find a balance with my friendships. I'm also a lot more interested in it now that I realized dating women as an option!","created_utc":1628466250000,"comment_id":"h86h2zs","parent_id":"t3_p098io","score":5,"submission_id":"p098io"}

{"author":"nanofarm","body":"One thing stood out in your post: you feel like you can\u2019t love yourself because you have *never experienced love* \n\nSo: you know from experience that looking for love outside yourself hasn\u2019t yielded results. Maybe it\u2019s time to start looking inside yourself. \n\nImagine how you would feel if someone loved you: what would that look and feel like? Get specific and write it down. What parts of you would you get to be ok with? What would you get to think and feel? What would it \u201cfix\u201d? Spend time really getting it all out. Spin the entire fantasy. You will probably cry, that\u2019s ok. \n\nNow, what is stopping you from feeling this way now? Why do you need someone else to give you permission? What if you could think and feel all of those good things with or without someone else? \n\n\nYou may need to go neutral at first because you will resist the idea that you are lovable. Forcing yourself to think positive thoughts that you don\u2019t yet believe is not really helpful. So make a list if the things that you don\u2019t dislike about yourself and move up from there. \nStart from compassion, can you have the same care and compassion for yourself that you would for someone else? Can you forgive yourself for not being (insert whatever is bothering you)? \n\nAs a side note: it is very hard to recognize or receive love (romantic or otherwise) when you don\u2019t love yourself. It causes cognitive dissonance which your brain hates so it will find ways to discount and disregard any love you have received. So you may have been more loved than you realized in the past. \n\nDo some thought exercises. Are you sure you have never been loved? By family? Friends? No one has even loved a part of you? Right now your brain can only find evidence that you are not loved. Give your brain the assignment of finding evidence that you are lovable. Brains are very good at finding evidence, so you have to decide where you want to direct that. \n\nFor example: my coworkers don\u2019t love me in a traditional sense but I know that they love having me as a coworker and admire my many good qualities. I\u2019m able to see that because I also love those things about me. And here\u2019s the cool thing: I only *think* they think those things because I believe it. Maybe they secretly hate me, I have no idea. My own mother could despise me and I would never be able to know for sure. \n\nOn the other side: I married and had a baby with a man I was sure loved me. Turns out he and I had different definitions of love. He doesn\u2019t think he lied but he didn\u2019t love me the way I thought he did. We had different thoughts\/ideas about love. I\u2019ll never know for sure what he felt for me but i didn\u2019t like how he treated me so I left. I felt very betrayed for a long time because I thought he cared for me. But I couldn\u2019t feel what he was feeling, i only had my perceptions. \n\nThis is where things start to get metaphysical and confusing but it\u2019s not as depressing as it seems! Love is a feeling that your thoughts create inside of you. That\u2019s all it is. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to feel love for someone- in fact it feels wonderful to love someone- the love I feel for my daughter is the most amazing thing in the world. You can feel that same love for yourself. \n\nLove is a feeling that only you can feel- you can\u2019t feel it for someone else or make them feel it for you. The experience of love comes ONLY from your thoughts about yourself and the other person. It isn\u2019t a sensation like hot or cold, it\u2019s an emotion which comes from your brain. \n\nYou are the only person you can count on to have your back until the day you die.","created_utc":1623043741000,"comment_id":"h0u77ar","parent_id":"t3_nt699n","score":9,"submission_id":"nt699n"}

I don't have my own business or anything, but while I'm working I want to go back and just keep learning new skills.  The worst thing you can do is stagnate, and unfortunately, that's where I'm at...\n\nBut I have a full time job.  it pays the bills.  I have enough left over to save, put into life insurance, etc.  And I do own a house\\* so long as I keep paying it off.\n\nI am free, but I work hard to maintain that level of independence. I'm also naturally a recluse and choose my friendships carefully.  I don't talk to people unless they make me happy.  Being introverted to hell turned out to be one of my best advantages in life.  I'm already good at filtering out people who don't add much to my own personal life.\n\n \n\n\\*I learned the hard way that you never actually own a house (my parents and that's a long story)... just the illusion of ownership.  Miss any kind of payment on it, or the banks play games, and you lose everything you put towards it.\n\nI'd keep renting, but renting is harsh on pet deposits.  I pay roughly the same in a mortgage as  I did in rent.  Utilities are higher, understandably.  My budget is +250.

Your level of safety is really going to depend on types of crimes in different cities\n\nI love South America and wish more people would travel there.  Peru is beautiful, especially if you love hiking!  You can do a shortened version of the Inca Trail up to Macchu Pichu, which I highly recommend \u2014 and Ollantaytambo is genuinely breathtaking.  There are also a lot of really cool ecosystems throughout Argentina.  When we lived there Aerolineas Argentina (the domestic airline) had a deal where you could get three tickets to any destination in the country for about 100 pesos.  So you could go to Iguazu (the rainforest), Patagonia (beautiful farmlands AND glaciers), and Mendoza (wine country).  I haven\u2019t been back since we lived there, but if you\u2019d like any advice for starting points on traveling in Argentina feel free to DM me!","created_utc":1692002930000,"comment_id":"jw2tgiw","parent_id":"t3_15qes9p","score":4,"submission_id":"15qes9p"}

My male friends have tried to charm me into sleeping with them or worse, have told me they find my personality attractive but not my body.. \n\nI just tell myself I\u2019ll find my people eventually. Naturally most involuntary introverts are only that way because they are unique and aren\u2019t focused on pleasing people. I used to never speak out of fear of being told to shut up when I was younger, and this got me in huge friend groups but destroyed my sense of self and exposed me to tons of frauds and narcissists. And I never felt like I belonged... It\u2019s so hard to make new friends when you\u2019re college aged too. :(","created_utc":1587573575000,"comment_id":"fo636db","parent_id":"t3_g5tbav","score":7,"submission_id":"g5tbav"}
{"author":"etherealmare","body":"Absolutely. I mean I\u2019m definitely an introvert, but I still want friends and to go out every now and then. I had friends in high school but then college came. Not exaggerating, I\u2019ve made 0 friends these past four years. Not even for a little while my freshman year or anything. Not for lack of trying, but I definitely stopped putting in as much effort after the second year. I\u2019m also a very critical person, and like you said, my personality is really a hit or miss with people. Especially the past four years, I really just kinda stick to myself and do my own thing. Other than Reddit I don\u2019t do any social media, so I don\u2019t keep up with movies or celebrities or trends, not interested, which I\u2019ve found really limits my social capabilities in the college environment. My interests are all over the place, so it\u2019s difficult to connect with people over things I do like. Tbh I have plans coming up to study\/work abroad for a few years, so at this point I really don\u2019t see any reason to try to connect with anyone. I\u2019ve gotten used to being on my own anyway. Friends would be cool, sure, but I\u2019m also perfectly fine alone. I find myself hilarious and enjoy my company.

This has done more for me than anything else because I used to put a lot of hope in being \u201crescued\u201d. You can\u2019t be self sufficient if you\u2019re waiting for a man to make your life easier. I know that now and I see my past behavior more clearly but I had to take time off dating to get here. I took a year intentionally but that has extended to two years now, not even texting or flirting.\n\n-Finances. And paperwork. Think life insurance, a will. These are important for everyone but especially a single mom. I am still learning and working on budgeting, I backslide a lot and bust out my credit card rather than saving up. But I\u2019m getting better all the time and nearly debt free again. My credit is recovering from a foreclosure so it actually helps to use my credit and then pay it off again. We can\u2019t rely on the government for our retirement, it is our responsibility .\n\n-spiritual. For me this has meant joining a nondenominational church and teaching my children about my religion but this can be whatever you want it to be to make yourself spiritually well.\n\n-health. Stopping drinking has been big for me right now, for health reasons. Working out daily. Nutrition. Sleep is the final frontier and biggest challenge for me but just overall taking control and ownership and responsibility for my health. We have our genetics and our behaviors which factor into our health and lifespan - behaviors are our responsibility!!!! This includes mental health, taking responsibility for the behaviors that keep me depressed, or anxious. Not everything is under my control but my behaviors ARE and that\u2019s a hard pill to swallow sometimes but I swallowed it.\n\n- creative. Now this I still struggle with because I have so many ideas for writing and entrepreneurship but I never have time. But I do want to make time and stop making excuses for this so that I can share my creative talents with the world.\n\n- socially, I need less interaction than most people. But I do have a girlfriend I call once a week. Think back to people you\u2019ve connected with in the past. My friend and I used to work together but we kept in touch and didn\u2019t really connect until years after we no longer worked together. There might be an old friend you can call and reconnect with.

{"author":"twirleygirl","body":"Here are some thought-provoking books that explore the concept of patriarchy, examining its impact on society, history, and individuals:\n\n# 1. \"The Second Sex\" by Simone de Beauvoir\n\n* A foundational feminist text, de Beauvoir analyzes the ways in which women have been historically marginalized in a patriarchal society. She explores how cultural, social, and biological forces have contributed to women\u2019s oppression.\n\n# 2. \"The Creation of Patriarchy\" by Gerda Lerner\n\n* Lerner offers a historical analysis of the development of patriarchy, tracing its origins back to ancient societies. She discusses how patriarchy became institutionalized, and its lasting effects on gender relations.\n\n# 3. \"The Feminine Mystique\" by Betty Friedan\n\n* This classic feminist text critiques the notion that women\u2019s fulfillment lies in domesticity. Friedan\u2019s work highlights the psychological and social limitations imposed by patriarchal expectations in the mid-20th century.\n\n# 4. \"Men Explain Things to Me\" by Rebecca Solnit\n\n* Solnit's collection of essays reflects on modern gender relations and how patriarchal structures continue to manifest in everyday life. The title essay discusses \u201cmansplaining,\u201d an illustration of subtle and pervasive aspects of patriarchy.\n\n# 5. \"The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love\" by bell hooks\n\n* In this powerful work, hooks addresses patriarchy from a male perspective, encouraging men to explore the ways it harms them as well as women. She advocates for an emotional awakening in men that challenges traditional gender roles.\n\n# 6. \"We Should All Be Feminists\" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\n* This book expands on a TED talk by Adichie, arguing for a new, inclusive understanding of feminism. Adichie critiques patriarchy and its impact on both men and women, while calling for equality.\n\n# 7. \"The End of Patriarchy: Radical Feminism for Men\" by Robert Jensen\n\n* Jensen, a male feminist writer, takes on the problem of patriarchy from a male perspective. He argues that challenging patriarchal norms is essential for men and women alike.\n\n# 8. \"Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale\" by Maria Mies\n\n* Mies examines patriarchy from a global perspective, focusing on how capitalist systems have perpetuated gender inequality. She explores the intersections between patriarchy, capitalism, and colonialism.\n\n# 9. \"Gender Trouble\" by Judith Butler\n\n* Butler\u2019s influential text in queer theory challenges traditional notions of gender and how they are constructed within patriarchal systems. She introduces the concept of gender performativity, destabilizing fixed ideas of gender roles.\n\n# 10. \"Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny\" by Kate Manne\n\n* Manne explores how misogyny functions as a way of enforcing patriarchal norms and maintaining male dominance. Her philosophical approach provides deep insights into the underpinnings of patriarchal oppression.","created_utc":1726610146000,"comment_id":"lnkkkz0","parent_id":"t3_1fiqsmt","score":10,"submission_id":"1fiqsmt"}

{"author":"kyoshimoshi","body":"Fear is normal, fear is an evolution\/instinct thing so it will remain in the body. And it serves its purpose in a way, so I don't know if fear should be done away with completely. \n\nI am sorry that you lost your family, sometimes you might have one but they're not really a loving one and you still end up feeling lonely all the time. But it is still alright, because you'll always have you. Be there for you more when loneliness strikes. \n\nIf you wake up in the night after a bad dream, make yourself a cup of tea or anything that soothes your nerves, helps you relax and ready for sleep again. Wanting to check in with someone after work - it is a good time to write in a personal journal - all the things you felt and experienced, the day you lived. When you see the words on the page and revisit the moments past, you'll feel more connected to your being.\n\nBored and lazy and watching a movie on Sundays - the cats are watching with you or keeping you company, it's not a terrible thing at all! And after the movie is over, you can write a review online, or tweet all the wisecracks and fun things, and just send it all into the ether of the internet, someone will hear you. \n\nNo one to talk to when you're out? Easily remedied. I sometimes put headphones around my neck and have lofi beats on as a background while still being able to hear all the busy noises of the crowd. Just hear and observe while you remain connected to yourself. If you feel that being alone is awkward, then it's kinda a harsh judgement on yourself. You're cool, you're enjoying your own company, you're whole, peaceful, and complete in yourself. It's a very attractive thing, tbh.\n\nHolidays alone are a wonderful time to be creative and make your own traditions and do things for the community or even just for yourself. You can donate some of that time to extra caring for yourself, fostering a kitten, helping\/volunteering in a shelter\/food bank, donating to a charity, planting a sapling, or if at home, building a model\/painting\/learning a new skill like knitting or crocheting or a new cuisine, or a new language, or planning your next trip, or simply trying a new diet, new physical exercises, reading books from a genre that's different to what you like, etc.\n\nThe fear will lessen in its intensity gradually.","created_utc":1688679338000,"comment_id":"jqvyxur","parent_id":"t3_14s6aum","score":18,"submission_id":"14s6aum"}

Before you even get to death though most elderly end up in the nursing home, regardless of how many children they had. Reality is the cure. Why do you need someonr to watch a movie? Do you not watch it with your eyes? I find myself with a different problem. I don't have enough lazy sunday afternoons to do all the things I want. Granted that is in part because I work 50 hours a week cause I'm trying to save for retirement. I do also  run two women only gaming groups that I meet with to play games. Outside of that I also have a very outgoing female friend who I go out with often. So I guess the answer is: learn to enjoy your own company, take some self defense classes--which I have done, also keep a couple of tazers handy--, cultivate female friends, and cultivate hobbies, specially ones you can do alone. My hobbies are board games-i can play all my board games alone since they all have a solo mode. And also roleplaying games--like dungeons and dragons--all with solo modes as well.

In theory you should not have to keep your ideas to yourself during therapy but I completely understand where you come from, I've been to therapy for some issues but I concealed my wish to stay single and instead didn't allow her to dabble onto this issue. Nearly everyone is so brainwashed into the idea that life is worthless without romance that I'm afraid a therapist might think she must manipulate me into falling into the \"traditional marriage\" bullshit again.\n\nWhat I think could be interesting is looking specifically for a therapist who works with LGBTQ+ people, seeing as asexuals and aromantics are part of the spectrum and therefore they might be able to have more open and flexible views on how different people feel about life and romance, generally speaking. I would never try a conservative or \"family-oriented\" therapist, and yeah I've heard of people complaining their older therapists tried to downplay shit\/gaslight them into fixing things up with abuse parents, and later it came to light that the therapists were doing so because they were parents themselves and were unable to accept a child may want to cut ties with them in future. So IMO younger\/childless therapists also could be a good idea.

{"author":"iknourbutwutmi","body":"I've been a fan of Alice Miller's work since I got around to reading *The Drama of the Gifted Child*, and I find it interesting that she developed the trauma model AFTER dedicating 20 years to practicing psychoanalysis. She ended up denouncing its viability as a method of treatment completely and cancelling a bunch of memberships to professional societies, and there's something I can't help but respect about that kind of paradigm shift. \n\nThe [wikipedia page](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alice_Miller_(psychologist)) has a better summary than I could write, as well as some other excerpts;\n\n> In April 1987 Miller announced in an interview with the German magazine Psychologie Heute (Psychology Today) her rejection of psychoanalysis. The following year she cancelled her memberships in both the Swiss Psychoanalytic Society and the International Psychoanalytic Association, because she felt that psychoanalytic theory and practice made it impossible for former victims of child abuse to recognize the violations inflicted on them and to resolve the consequences of the abuse, as they \"remained in the old tradition of blaming the child and protecting the parents.\"\n\n...\n\n>Miller called electroconvulsive therapy \"a campaign against the act of remembering.\" In her book Abbruch der Schweigemauer (The Demolition of Silence), she also criticized psychotherapists' advice to clients to forgive their abusive parents, arguing that this could only hinder recovery through remembering and feeling childhood pain. It was her contention that the majority of therapists fear this truth and that they work under the influence of interpretations culled from both Western and Oriental religions, which preach forgiveness by the once-mistreated child. She believed that forgiveness did not resolve hatred, but covered it in a dangerous way in the grown adult: displacement on scapegoats, as she discussed in her psycho-biographies of Adolf Hitler and J\u00fcrgen Bartsch, both of whom she described as having suffered severe parental abuse.\n\n\n\nHer trauma model is interesting, and I think it's cool how it was developed as a rejection of a field in which she had become an accomplished practitioner. I tend to lean towards the branch of psychology that doesn't needlessly pathologize human emotions, especially unpalatable ones, like anger and sadness ","created_utc":1502920210000,"comment_id":"dlpa39l","parent_id":"t3_6tygft","score":13,"submission_id":"6tygft"}

If a single female want a to share say the cost of accommodation or heating or bills, she can get a roommate, but a husband will usually make her stay home to take care of a child and therefore there is one income to cover three people rather than one income to cover one person. \n\nThe only situation I can think of that can help a married woman is if she works and the husband works and they don't have children and they split costs of accommodation and utilities, but even then this can be achieved with a housemate or roommate without the risk of pregnancy which depletes wealth greatly as the woman is not earning and is missing out on building skills, which depletes wealth even more.","created_utc":1500054134000,"comment_id":"dk7fec4","parent_id":"t1_dk794f9","score":7,"submission_id":"6n0r0n"}

Even if it\u2019s just a craft kit from your local hobby store, creating something interesting or useful with your hands restores a whole lot of sanity points when things are hard.\n\nGet in a routine of going out, even if you aren\u2019t making any real social connections. Spend an hour or two at the library or a local park. Take yourself out for lunch. See if any theaters near you do cheap weekday or morning tickets. Just getting out and being around other people, getting outside, makes a difference.\n\nFind a cause you care about and volunteer! There really are options for any personality or skillset. I personally go to my local animal shelter a few times a week and find it so rewarding. Yours might be tutoring students after school, socializing with elders, supporting residents at a homelessness or domestic violence shelter, working at a community garden, advocating for a political \/ social cause\u2014 think about what kind of work you enjoy, what causes you care about, and find a way to get involved.\n\n(Being at the shelter also helped me a lot when I was mourning and missing my own pet.

{"author":"Wise-Novel6437","body":"A couple years ago when I was staying with my grandparents after a fire, I was going to Ren Fest and I didn't wear a bra under my dress. My grandma felt the need to comment on it and try to stop me from leaving. I also started a new job as a rehab crisis tech at that time and was on night shift, but I never got any sleep because of how my grandparents would never bother to be quiet, and the minute my grandpa came home from golf (because that's where he always was, at golf or parked in front of the TV, God forbid he actually do anything around the house), I could forget about sleeping because he'd be talking or yelling at the top of his lungs or have the TV blaring. This went on for weeks, to the point where I'd average maybe an hour of sleep a day and ended up passing out at work multiple times before getting fired because I couldn't focus. I asked them to stop multiple times and they just played the victim and ignored me the next day. I couldn't afford a hotel and had nowhere else to go.\n\nThey pulled some shit during my college internship too, it was a hybrid remote position and I was on Zoom calls a lot of the day in my room but no matter how many times I told them not to interrupt me because I would be busy with my internship, they would just barge in and try to get my attention. Literally no fucking reason either, they just wanted to know where I was. I was a 23 year old woman, they shouldn't have felt the need to constantly keep track of me WHEN I TOLD THEM MULTIPLE TIMES I WOULD BE BUSY. It made me look incredibly unprofessional and I got reprimanded by my supervisor. I could have lost that internship and not graduated college because of them. I highly doubt my male cousins would have had the same experience, but I was the one always told \"oh, they're old, you need to be kind and patient.\" I TRIED! I TRIED SO MANY FUCKING TIMES! I AM SICK OF BEING WALKED ALL OVER!\n\nAnyway I don't talk to them anymore, partially because of their misogyny and general disrespect toward me, partially because they got me fired, and partially because they're generally horrible, bigoted people who think being \"from a different time\" is an excuse and that they're owed special privileges solely because of their age. If I wanted to babysit and mollycoddle the elderly I would do it for pay at a nursing home, not for free when I'm supposed to be doing something time sensitive that has a huge impact on my future and when I'm on a live video call making a first impression with a new colleague.\n\nEdit for other things I want to include:\n\n1. They were teaching my cousin, who was at the time 11 years old, how to cook. Cooking is an important life skill and she enjoys it and is good at it, but they literally got her to the point where she was cooking full meals within a few months and they saw no issue with a grown man not even having the cooking skills of an elementary aged child. Also, once she made a dessert and my grandpa wanted a piece brought over and served to him in his living room chair so he wouldn't have to get up and stop watching his show. She's close to them and I worry a lot about how they might influence her.\n\n\n\n2. Once my grandma asked my grandpa to set the table for dinner and he put out plates and forks...for chili. And then said \"oh, you do it so much better anyway.\" No attempt to fix the supposed mistake.\n\n\n\n3. He didn't even attempt to cook when my grandma was sick, he just brought takeout.\n\n\n\n4. He tried to dictate where we went for my college graduation dinner. I love Indian food and generally things with a lot of spice and strong flavor, and I love trying new foods and things from other cultures. My favorite Indian restaurant was nearby, so obviously that's what I picked. At first he tried to insist we go \"somewhere American\" and refused to go there, and when we did go to the Indian place he just pouted the whole time and refused to try anything but a small salad even though my mom kept trying to help him find things she thought he'd like. Also kept making comments TO THE INDIAN WAITER about his culture's food \"tasting funny.\" \n\n\n\n5. He's also skipped every single one of my birthday dinners going back years and made my grandma skip them too because he wanted \"American food.\" Note that he generally has zero issue trying European foods and does like Italian, so this is specifically about cultures of color.\n\n\n\n6. I was wearing a fan merch sweatshirt from one of my favorite TV shows, which happens to have the devil as a main character. They're very religious Catholics, so my mom made me promise not to tell them what the show really is. So I had to explain this man's face being on my chest without explaining the actual show. They insinuated that I had a crush on the actor. I'm a lesbian, which they don't specifically know but they do know I've never seriously dated a man and I did bring my ex girlfriend to a family gathering once.\n\n\n\n7. I know for a fact that he says the N word and that he went out of his way to enroll my mom and her siblings into a private catholic school because he didn't want them going to school with black kids.\n\n\n\n8. He slacked off and partied the entire time he was in college, to the point it took him ten years to get a Bachelor's degree. My mom would have been around 2 when he finally graduated and she has four older siblings, meaning that in the 60s, when his wife and four children would have had no choice but to rely on him as the breadwinner, he chose to only think about himself rather than do anything to ensure his family's future and financial security.","created_utc":1692415849000,"comment_id":"jwrhlir","parent_id":"t3_15pkcsv","score":3,"submission_id":"15pkcsv"}

I also found out how crappy of a life feeder rats had before they were frozen, and that made me sad. So I built a rat colony. All the moms and dads were tame pets and the others had a very happy life with lots of room to play and enrichment and fresh veggies. I humanely euthanized them with CO2 (they just get sleepy and relaxed) then my snakes get healthy food that had a good life and I get lots of pet rats. Any excess feeders get tamed and played with and given to niblings and neighbors who want pets or if I get a big surplus I can sell them on Craigslist to help pay for food and toys. \n\nSo you know where my heart is, I used to work in the food industry and now refuse to be a part of that system. I have chickens for eggs and meat as well as dairy goats. They all live glorious happy lives, even the ones that I peacefully and humanely butcher for food. I rarely eat meat and only if sustainably grown. I felt like the same should apply to the feeder animals for my reptiles.

Just haven't had the funds to properly take care of one... and having issues with the idea since I am Vegan and don't necessarily want to pay into breeding rats to feed my snake. So I've looked into Crested Geckos because you can get a special imsect powder meal for them and give them fruit as a treat once in a while. \n\nI've also looked into Rats and Rabbits because herbivorous diets.

So, I've looked into Rats. They are so cute and intelligent. But people are afraid of them like snakes because \"gross\/ violent.\" And lizards just get hated on because it isn't a furry animal. \n\nI may one day find a way to have all of them, tbh.

{"author":"Environmental_Bread7","body":"TRP uses some twisted version of evolutionary psychology for their arguments (which is quite funny on its own, as they often devalue social sciences and only acknowledge STEM, lol). The results of evolutionary psychology have to be treated with caution, even if one has an unbiased view. Evo psych studies don't actually investigate how people in the stone age behaved (that would be the job of anthropology, or archaeology, if you want to). Usually, evo psych studies investigate a certain behaviour in present times (e.g. if men or women have different priorities when looking for a partner). Quite often, these are even done by questionnaires, not behavioural methods. Then, they conclude that this behaviour difference stems from women having to be more picky because they might bear the children and it's an evolutionary trait. That's a bit of a circular logic though, because the only thing such a study really gives evidence for is how things are right now at the present moment, in the western society this study was conducted. \n\nQuestionnaire studies don't always correlate with real behaviour, either and methodology plays a huge part. E.g. there was a speed dating study that came to the conclusion that women are more picky than men. It turned out that in this study, women had been the ones to sit down and men the ones to move from table to table. When the study was repeated and women were the ones to move around, suddenly men were the gender that was more picky. In short, many of there studies have to be interpreted with care even when making conclusions about the present time, and we have to be even more careful with concluding that a certain behaviour is evolutionary \"wired\" (and honestly, a lot of evo-psych research is done by men, so there's a bias as well...)\n\nAnyway, TRP goes a step further by either misinterpretation or simply just inventing things. E.g. recently I read a post where a guy stated that women release a certain hormone when they lose their virginity and it makes them less likely to pair-bond. WTF? I'm truly amazed how one can just invent a biological process. There is no such a hormone (which hormone should that even be?) that is released during the first time one has sex (but not during other times). Makes zero sense. Just a plain lie without ANY kind of scientific basis. \n\nThe thing you stated is another example. We know that children of educated mothers (and fathers) do better in pretty much every area. A lot of those might stem from social injustice (as opposed to biological reasons), but the idea that an educated mother doesn't benefit the child is just bullshit. Similarly, from an evolutionary viewpoint, of course everyone would want to mate with an intelligent partner to secure the best genes for their children. On average (when asked), men view looks as more important in choosing a partner than women do (while women view status as more important than men do). However, that doesn't mean that men (again, on average) don't value education in their partner, they just value it as much as women do. \n\nLast, everybody knows that we don't always behave in the way it is optimal from an evolutionary point of view. E.g. since decades evolutionary psychologists try to find an explanation why gay people (and animals) exist. Or why human women have an early menopause and continue to live for 40+ years after not being able to reproduce anymore (shocking! Seems bearing children is not the only value women bring, even from an evolutionary point of view). There's not much of a final conclusion on that. There's lots of women who are happy without children and god knows there are enough that are unhappy with children. Life is more than survival and mating.","created_utc":1602012369000,"comment_id":"g7vva5w","parent_id":"t3_j6137b","score":8,"submission_id":"j6137b"}

When a woman has a baby, she is normally the one who needs to stay home to look after it, which means she sacrifices her career. She sacrifices earnings and skills development. This makes her financially dependent on the husband.*\n\n*The reason why women are oppressed so much is because of natural biology i.e. pregnancy and motherhood. The fact that women have to tear up their bodies to let the species continue shows how gruesome biology is, and the demands of pregnancy and child rearing make women dependent on men, which gives men the natural upper hand. Also, motherhood deprives women the freedom to pursue intellectual interests, tying them down to the status of incubators and gestators. As far as biology goes, a woman\u2019s purpose is mainly that she can act as a birthing machine.*\n\n*It is for this reason that I believe that nothing holds women back more than motherhood and that women should never have children if they want independence and autonomy, which are basic freedoms.*\n\n*Compared to being single, marriage is a bum deal for many woman. Accordingly, married women are less happy than single women and less happy than their husbands, they are less eager than men to marry, they\u2019re more likely to file for divorce and, when they do, they are happier as divorcees than they were when married (the opposite is true for men) and they are more likely than men to prefer never to remarry.*\n\n*The only reason this is surprising is because of the torrent of propaganda we get that tells us otherwise.*\n\n*We are told by books, sitcoms, reality shows, and romantic comedies that single women are wetting their pants to get hitched.*\n\n**Financial freedom**\n\nBasically I think the keys to financial independence is to live a minimalist lifestyle, which means minimising large obligations eg no children, no marriage, no luxury car etc. Try to keep expenses down. Then you will be able to save up more. Then put these savings into assets eg shares, ETFs or real estate. These assets should pay income eg real estate can be rented out which means you get rental income. Shares and ETFs pay dividends. The value of these assets tend to go up over time (not guaranteed) but they will pay you passive income that does not require you to do any work.","created_utc":1622676486000,"comment_id":"h0bnaj6","parent_id":"t3_nqne2x","score":17,"submission_id":"nqne2x"}

{"author":"aprilleaves","body":"I think you're going to get a lot of awesome insight about less emotional labour, more reciprocation, awesome appropriate mirroring... Dating a girl is pretty great! So maybe I'll focus on the not so good parts just to talk about the other bits? \n\nI feel that when I date a woman I genuinely care for them more, and am worried more? Their pain hurts me more and especially their safety too. When I date men I really give less of a shit and can be more curt with them, even if they cry in front of me. I suppose that's the conditioning I received when I was growing up, that men are more tough or something.\n\nWith women the communication is more intense and constant, and we msg each other way more, so I feel like the mental occupancy of them in my head is at full capacity or something. With a man it's way less, I don't talk as much and I sometimes find their communication online quite infuriating though it can also be more hilarious? Basically, I have to give more attention and mental space to a woman when we're not physically together too. This is bad and good, I'm a big fan of living fantasies in my head and this can be really wonderful, but can be downright distracting and detrimental if I have to be at a task that needs my 100% focus on. Part of my mind would always be thinking about her.\n\nI think with women there is more affection and gentleness, with men there is a more raw kind of sexual energy (that I enjoy, I enjoy being taken in some way)... I enjoy that lingering lust that hangs in the air with a man, but it's pretty much over once we're in bed together (like some arbitrary goalpost has been reached)... Then it is mostly a chore I want to get over with ASAP, there is also more fear when I'm sexually engaged with a man because they can impregnate me, they can hurt me etc. With a woman sex feels way more liberating but less 'raw' and more romantic in some way? I prefer to build awesome pillow forts, snuggle and cuddle in a safe space and make love to a woman in these scenarios, maybe because of the comfort I receive, and I find sex with men to smell a little repulsive with time.\n\nLastly when I date a woman I feel that it is taken way less seriously? There is the burden of somewhat coming out to my parents (I am in Asia and it's really quite unacceptable here, or that it is accepted as a form of novelty and fetish that will phase itself out), there is doubt expressed by other men who want to convert you back... It is really all quite disgusting. To some men here, a girl who dated women before and then settled with a man is seen as being confused and finally \"turned straight\", a gold star lesbian is seen as a impossible thing to conquer, a woman who dated men before and settled with a woman is seen as someone who couldn't get any better. Toxic shit like this is pretty much very draining to deal with often, and it does kind of make you doubt your feelings when you hear so much of it. When I was dating a woman I sometimes had envy for other women dating men because their lives seemed easier, I had to protect myself more and be tougher, and I had to exert a greater presence in male dominated spaces. So yea.\n\nBut overall I think the love I have for a woman runs deeper, maybe even more than the family unit I would create with a man. Remember that post on merging spaces?

When I was unemployed I always found my jobs alone (my brother for example, needed my mom to talk with some neighboors to help him find two jobs he had), I moved to a new city alone and took care of all the process of finding a house there and finding a way to move my stuff. I do vacations alone, I spend most of my days alone. Even when I liked someone, it was a LDR which I realize now was enough for me because it somehow fulfilled my emotional needs to have someone who I could text but distant enough that I wouldn't have to deal with them (still think LDR are sort of crap, but okay, they served their learning purpose for me). \n\nIt was a process, a couple of years ago I was craving men attention because I never had. I was bullyed growing up, I thought I was so ugly, so having some male attention helped me understand that that's not the case. So then after a while, I slowed down in seeking male attention and entered a phase where I wanted someone to have a long lasting stable relationship that cared about me.\n\nIt took a few experiences to realize that that's probably not going to happen. The only thing that makes me miserable in my life is that I still don't own a house in the city where I work so I can take my dogs there with me and don't have to interact anymore with my abusive parents. No man will ever provide that for me (well at least not without some attached abuse because men are foreign to the concept of giving just because), so I don't really need one.

My father and brother could have called earlier in the day my dog was unwell if they had done so I would have came home and be with her. Maybe she would still be alive or if not I would have been with her. Instead they didn't call me because they either ignored it or was too much work.

Most important is to plan ahead at least a bit (but don't forget that some problems can be solved better in the moment and there's often people around willing to help). Know your route, know the dangers, find a on- or offline map that has good places for sleeping\/camping and getting water. 90% of your concern will be where to sleep, where to next find water, and where to buy food again. But be prepared that once you show up at a place, it might not be how you pictured it - so be willing to improvise in the moment.\n\nEducate yourself on safety on the trail - what dangers are there and how can you avoid them\/react if they occur. E.g. bad weather, storms, injuries,...\n\nImho, you don't necessarily need to train that much. It's helpful to be fit, and of course do some shorter hikes to know what to expect. However, every able-bodied person can hike (and a lot of disabled ones, too). If you are out of form, you might get tired faster or walk slower. That's not a problem, though. You can just slow down or take a break. It will take you more days to hike, but that's all. You will also build muscles in your legs once you hike for a longer time.\n\nedit: And I second the advise about breaking your shoes in! A lot! Even if they feel fine on shorter hikes, they might start to hurt on longer hikes.","created_utc":1627059148000,"comment_id":"h688hhn","parent_id":"t3_opt7ey","score":9,"submission_id":"opt7ey"}

I knew I had good grades I just thought I wasn't a natural at it so I wouldn't succeed. \n\nFrom someone who is not a natural genius, the secret is to work hard. Practice a lot of exercises, start from the basic ones then progress to more advanced ones and always clarify your doubts.  Some of them will require some focus, so remove distractions for a couple of hours. Establish a method or pattern to solve the problems, after that it's always the same logic, the only thing that changes are the values. \n\nHave a notebook (or several) where you can do your exercises or if you prefer, a lot of loose sheets in a ring dossier, but I do prefer notebooks because sometimes you may lose the sheets and it's annoying.","created_utc":1627596919000,"comment_id":"h6yid0u","parent_id":"t3_olnezw","score":4,"submission_id":"olnezw"}

I have to say I do still have contact to my family, but they don't support me financially (nor does anyone else). \n\nYou don't get paid 20% less than a man no matter where you go. The gap differs per industry and also depends on if you have a child or not. Part of the gender pay gap is because women stay at home more with children or take care of their man-child instead of investing in their own career. There's still a gap for single childless women, of course, but less than for mothers. Then, in some industries you will earn a quite well. Even if it is 20% less than your male co-workers, it's still a lot. \n\nI work in a mostly female field, so no bosses have hit on me (no landlords, either, but that might be just luck). I guess in that case it's safer to get in an apartment complex that is managed by a company  - less personal contact with your landlord. \n\nI also live in a city with low street crime and I feel fine walking home at night on my own. I lived with flat-mates for most of my life, but felt fine during the times I lived alone as well, because I had a good relationship with my neighbours then. I think building a good social network is important, not just for safety, but also to have friends to take care of you when you're sick, help you moving, comfort you when you feel bad...\n\nI don't think I can help much with credit etc. since I'm not from the USA, but if you have questions about anything else, just ask :)","created_utc":1602118907000,"comment_id":"g80pn0h","parent_id":"t3_j6a7c7","score":3,"submission_id":"j6a7c7"}

It is hard to find friends as an adult and build a new life (even harder now, thanks covid), but if you are open to the world, it is very rewarding.\n\nAs for pay, there are some strategies you can use to help close that salary gap.  If you have a very feminine name, submit your resume as your first (or first and middle) initials and your last name.  Wear slacks, not skirts to the interview, keep you shoulders up and back, but relaxed, speak in short sentences and with confidence, try to connect with your interviewer on a personal note, and ask for 15% more than your comfortable cost of living (i.e. if rent, utilities, slush fund and savings is $2500\/month, ask for 3250\/month.  Always ask for more.)\n\nBasically, you're trying to remove that inherent bias that employers have when hiring women.  Also wouldn't hurt to lie and make up a serious relationship you don't have.

{"author":"saralafontaine","body":"I read some of your posts on your profile page and I love the one about the photo with the tractors. That really hit home for me. It's kinda what I'm talking about.\n\nI totally don't plan on buddying up with some bro to support me. Never. NEVER :)  I'm just saying that from just looking around me, it seems like an unspoken thing. I actually had a huge argument with some of my family about it, and basically they gaslit me and told me I was imagining things. But I can clearly see that young women live with men for support and are supported by their families too, and 100% financially independent women are hard to find. Even if it's an ex-husband, or inheriting money, lots of people are getting help from somewhere, but oftentimes will showboat as independent and then shame me for not being able to \"get my shit together\", which hurts a lot because it feels like this kinda stuff is systemic. The shaming people is mostly my family, but also other people, the aforementioned ones who receive lots of help!\n\nAnyway, my questions would be, how would I go about getting my own apartment when my credit isn't that great, how do I get a job where the boss won't sexually harass me and the girls at the job won't be catty (even on a subtle level), and afford to live somewhere that's nice and safe? How do you even go about scoping which neighborhoods are the safest? And how do you stay sane in such a sexist world? :(","created_utc":1602060816000,"comment_id":"g7yg88m","parent_id":"t1_g7x7l7j","score":5,"submission_id":"j6a7c7"}
{"author":"saralafontaine","body":"Well, thanks for the advice, but financial independence and not relying on a man was always my plan and exactly what I was talking about in my original post. \n\nMy point was, our society is structured, and many peoples' expectations are, that women will EVENTUALLY rely on a man; as a young person I already see my friends paired up and depending on their boyfriends and husbands, even if they claim superficially they split the bills. Yet the woman is clearly needing the man to survive on her own. OR, other women my age are at least partially supported by their parents. It's hard for me to find an example of a woman alone in the world surviving financially and thriving without at least help from her family or from a boyfriend. \n\nIt's hard to find a place to live because my credit isn't that great and so landlords will reject me. I can get a room with roommates but I don't want to do that forever. I can talk to a landlord one-on-one, tell them my story, and hopefully they'll sympathize, but then I'm making myself vulnerable. \n\nAnd I've worked at a number of different jobs and there is always a dynamic of the top-boss flirting with the younger women. No matter how professional they claim to be. Or, not even the younger women, just plain harassment. And the harassment can be subtle but it's always there. I've had people say I'm \"imagining\" this but I'm absolutely not, and that is sexism to say. \n\nSo, I'm imagining going to another city, and I'm just seeing all this crap I have to deal with, all on my own. AND I have to be worried about walking home at night, and not having a car, and not having any friends and knowing nobody, especially in the time of coronavirus. It's very stressful. \n\nBut, of course, like you said, relying on a man is much worse. So no, of course, that isn't and never will be an option. :)","created_utc":1602060204000,"comment_id":"g7yf59k","parent_id":"t1_g7y3drn","score":2,"submission_id":"j6a7c7"}

I've heard too many stories about partners emptying the joint bank account to ever want to go down that road.\n\nFinancial literacy and setting reasonable personal goals are key development areas. Even if you end up in a relationship where your finances are tied you will be in a much better position if you have a handle on your own finances. If you stay single then you need to be realistic about the kind of lifestyle you can afford and educate yourself about ways to maximise your finances.","created_utc":1651006999000,"comment_id":"i69ed1u","parent_id":"t3_ubjkrg","score":12,"submission_id":"ubjkrg"}

If she's too self-absorbed at the moment to be already regretting her thoughtless words, then maybe, when the time is right, you can help her see how much they hurt you.\n\nIf she doesn't care about how her words affected you, then that's absolutely not a friend you need in your life. But if she said that only because she was sitting in the depths of despair and wrestling with her own fears of meaninglessness, then I think there's hope for her. Different families\/ faiths\/ cultures have really deep conditioning about what constitutes meaning, so it's even possible that the gap between what she said and what you heard is bigger than either of you realize. And hearing each other's perspectives on this could even bring you closer. \n\nThat said, your pain is valid too and I hope you're tending to it. This may be a perfect time to look at the balance of your relationship: if the thoughtful gestures and emotional support are one-sided, then scaling back your efforts could be one way of honoring yourself better in this relationship. \n\nI know that the more I give in a relationship, the higher my expectations of reciprocity and the lower my tolerance for feeling wronged or betrayed in specific ways. It's not that these expectations are wrong- at all- but that I have this way of sort of creating a contract that the other person never actually agreed to. It's a way of protecting myself from being hurt. By backing off a little and being less of a 'perfect friend' I can level the playing field a bit without expecting anything of the other person.\n\nAnyway, I don't know if this actually applies to your situation but I hear some of myself in your post so I hope it helps.","created_utc":1690682271000,"comment_id":"jtyyo6g","parent_id":"t3_151ib0r","score":3,"submission_id":"151ib0r"}

{"author":"ayan_berry","body":"### Transcript\n\n**Title:** [*More Korean parents now prefer daughters over sons*](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/nation\/2023\/07\/113_333715.html)\n\n[[Image link - A newborn in a crib \/ gettyimages]](https:\/\/img.koreatimes.co.kr\/upload\/newsV2\/images\/202208\/2b52553af0134e359e82fbbe0fcf5165.jpg\/dims\/resize\/740\/optimize)\n\n**Centuries-old preference for sons fades with some improvements in women's status and aging society**\n\nBy Lee Hae-rin\n\nAmong younger parents planning to have children, there is a popular belief about how many children of a certain gender it is ideal to have. It goes that parents with two daughters are the most ideal, while those who have one daughter and one son are the second most ideal. Those who end up having two sons without any daughters are the least desirable, it goes.\n\nKim Yeon-ju, 30, a Gyeonggi Province-based office worker who has been on maternity leave since March said she fully agrees with this belief.\n\n\"I clearly see the trend that daughters are more preferred than sons, particularly among young couples who are planning to have a baby,\" she told The Korea Times, adding that she is one of the parents who prefers daughters over sons. \"We younger mothers say that while growing up, boys become distant like strangers, and they just leave home once they get married and form a new family, as few of them share emotional interactions with their parents.\"\n\nEvery child should be a blessing. But, as the saying goes, daughters are pervasively more preferred than sons in Korea these days. According to a recent survey by Hankook Research which was conducted on over 1,000 people across the country, 55 percent think that \"having a daughter is a must,\" while only 31 percent said that having boy is a must.\n\n[[Image link - Survey summary. Do you agree or disagree with the following statements?  -  Parents need a daughter: No idea: 2%; Disagree: 43%; Agree: 55%.  -  Parents need a son: No idea: 3%; Disagree: 66%; Agree: 31%.]](https:\/\/img.koreatimes.co.kr\/upload\/newsV2\/images\/202208\/162f62f3f60f4c7f871445069e6bda4c.jpg)\n\nIn the survey, daughters are preferred over boys by parents of all age groups, but the trend was especially remarkable among respondents over age 60. In that age group, 70 percent preferred girls, which is significantly higher than the 43 percent who prefer boys.\n\nKorean parents preferring daughters over sons is an irony in that the country has been male-dominated for centuries, due to the emphasis on neo-Confucian values. Historically, mothers with daughters were encouraged to and even threatened to bear additional children to secure their family lineage through male descendants. Female family members were treated as second-class citizens who could take only limited part in filial duties including inheriting property, carrying on the family line, ancestral worship and supporting one's parents.\n\nSince sex selection technology was introduced and became widely available in the 1970s and 1980s, the gender preference appeared more visible through female infanticide at birth, sharply raising the sex ratio at birth to 116 boys per 100 girls in 1990, whereas the natural average is 103 boys to 107 girls.\n\n[[Image link - Seen is a neonatal unit at a hospital in Seoul in this file photo taken in February 2019. Korea Times file photo]](https:\/\/img.koreatimes.co.kr\/upload\/newsV2\/images\/202208\/824106bf9dc6439692179beced2bc278.jpg)\n\nHowever, Korea has overturned the gender preference and become \"the first Asian country to reverse the trend in rising sex ratios at birth,\" according to a World Bank policy research paper from 2007.\n\nThe country's sex ratios at birth first reached the natural range of 103 to 107 boys per 100 girls in 2007, at 106.2, while the latest figure from 2020 is as low as 104.8 boys per 100 girls, it found.\n\nThe growing preference for daughters is remarkable in the adoption sector as well. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said that 65.4 percent of 260 domestically adopted children in 2020 were female.\n\n\"Korea is not only the first, but it is also the only country in the world to see a quick decline in son preference,\" said Cho Young-tae, a professor at Seoul National University's Graduate School of Public Health who specializes in demography and population profiling.\n\nCho explained that the reverse trend was partly due to the shifts in filial functions from sons to daughters.\n\n\"Normally, societies that have a strong and pervasive preference for sons tend to hold a strong belief in continuing the family lineage. But that has quickly disappeared in Korea, and older generations have changed to value their lives before death over the family's future,\" Cho said, explaining that sons no longer have the same degree of privilege over their functions as family members that they had in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, Korean parents have begun to be aware of the benefits of having daughters and come to rely on them in their sunset years.\n\nThe parent generations have learned through their experiences that daughters tend to make better emotional connections with parents and eagerly support their parents in their later years, Cho said. As a result, parents have grown more dependent on daughters, who are better candidates to take care of them when they are weak and old, especially as life expectancies have increased.\n\n[[Image link - In this picture taken on May 3, children run across a barley field at Sangnim Park in Hamyang, South Gyeongsang Province. Yonhap]](https:\/\/img.koreatimes.co.kr\/upload\/newsV2\/images\/202208\/63ed0a47a93f42dd95d1eee81d6f6a28.jpg)\n\nCompared to women's subordinated status in Korea historically, women's somewhat improved socio-economic status today is another reason behind daughters replacing sons in preference, Cho said. Women are less heavily dominated by their in-laws than they were in the past, while their parents-in-law now put less pressure on them to bear a son.\n\n\"Most of all, women who have survived the era of strong son preference in Korea from the 1980s and 1990s have now grown up to become the generation that gives birth and becomes parents. They know for themselves that having a son is not a must,\" Cho said.\n\nAlthough daughters are favored over sons, however, the reversed preference for daughters doesn't necessarily mean women are equal to men, or that they have any kind of elevated social status.\n\n\"It reflects the social expectations and designated roles on women to do more household chores and emotional labor than men in the family,\" Lee Joo-hee, a professor of sociology at Ewha Womans University said.\n\nAccording to Lee, daughters are more physically available to have more attachment and connections because they are 20 to 30 percent less involved in economic activities than men, while receiving social pressure to perform a higher level of emotional labor.\n\nA Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) working paper on the gender disparity in Korea's labor market published in July highlights the gap in the female labor force driven by married women with children. The report points out the link between the labor market and fertility patterns, where many women fail to return to work after giving birth, whereas unmarried women with no children tend to remain employed more or less as men are.\n\n\"Compared to the past, thoughts of gender equity have become more popular and have influenced the decline of the preference for sons. However, preferring daughters over sons doesn't necessarily mean we have achieved gender equity,\" Lee said. \"Instead, it's another form of sex discrimination, because daughters are preferred over sons for the same reasons sons were preferred over daughters in the past \u2015 to have more functional value to them as a child.\"\n\n[More articles by this reporter](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www2\/common\/morelist.asp?categorycode=704&id=lhr)","created_utc":1688213253000,"comment_id":"jq7zjod","parent_id":"t3_14nhqwp","score":15,"submission_id":"14nhqwp"}
