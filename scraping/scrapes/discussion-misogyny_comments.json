{"author":"Xander707","body":"I remember vividly MAGA republicans said liberals were totally over-reacting that anything was going to happen to abortion rights when Trump was elected. Then as each new Trump appointed Supreme Court Justice was confirmed, liberals were once again assured that, like the Justices said, Roe has been settled law for decades. Calm down. Relax. Trump is going to save America and he\u2019s not going to strip your rights away\u2026\n\n\nThen they celebrated when those rights were, just as feared, stripped away. They didn\u2019t care it had all been a lie, and they don\u2019t care about the needless deaths that have been caused in the wake of it all. This is what MAGA does; they tell us that our fears are unfounded. Fears about Trump taking away rights, fears about Trump using the military against his political opponents, fears that Trump is a fascist, they are all irrational fears, they say. And when those fears are in fact proven legitimate and vindicated, *they celebrate.*\n\nThey celebrate.\n\n\nRemember that.","created_utc":1730500150000,"comment_id":"luv1sjl","parent_id":"t3_1gh6au5","score":13,"submission_id":"1gh6au5"}
{"author":"hematite2","body":"This is why people touting \"well they have exceptions for the health of the mother!\" doesn't work. Because those health exceptions are (deliberately) vague on what actually counts, and doctors aren't qualified to make those legal decisions. They end up only kicking in when the woman is literally dying right there, as opposed to 'health is in imminent danger and could fail at any moment\". Not to mention cases where they know in advancd the fetus is 100% **going** to die, but since it isn't dead **yet** you can't get an abortion, you just have to wait and risk your health (and future fertility) until then.\n\nLook at the Cox case in Texas. A woman knows her fetus is going to die and there's nothing she can do about it. She actually goes to a court, and they rule that she qualifies for a health exception. But then SCOTX intervenes and says 'no, that doesn't count, we'll prosecute anyone who attempts this\". Meanwhile, Cox is in and out of emergency rooms with her health constantly in danger, while courts argue back and forth over her rights compared to an **already dying** fetus.  If courts are arguing about it, how can you expect doctors to make those decisions when someone's life hangs in the balance?","created_utc":1730502843000,"comment_id":"luva4cu","parent_id":"t3_1gh6au5","score":6,"submission_id":"1gh6au5"}

{"author":"Fantastic-Leopard131","body":"On February 22, 2024, Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student, was killed while she was jogging at the University of Georgia. At 12:38 p.m., Riley\u2019s body was discovered by UGA police in Oconee Forest Park behind Lake Herrick. Her death was caused by blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. The man who not just killed her, but sexually assaulted her, beat her, and then strangled her to death, was an illegal immigrate that was let in by the biden\/harris administration. He has 3 counts of felony murder, one malice murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault with intent to rape, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and tampering with evidence. \n\nIf my options as a women are either to die in a nice hospital bed, or to be sexually assaulted and then brutally and violently murdered, id take dying in a hospital bed with my mother by my side any day. This is what Kamals America looks like, raping and violently murdering women who went out for a nice run bc shes too weak to close our boarder and protect Americans. Add in the things like fentanyl deaths due to drugs passing through the border and there\u2019s no question about which candidate has the far greater death count on their hands. \n\nDying in a hospital under Trump sounds like a dream compared to the death Kamala is offering me. Think about that, cause if i were you id be careful bring up the death toll if youre voting for kamala bc its very hypocritical to turn around and ignore the deaths she has on her hands.\n\nSecond point - https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_wrongful_convictions_in_the_United_States \nConsider this list of wrongful convictions. A number of ppl here were innocent but convicted  and served time in prison due to a wrongful conviction. Is the right course of action to just legalize murder and rape bc under those laws some ppl face unintended and wrong outcomes? Anyone with common sense would say no, that its an absurd argument to say we should do away with the whole law just bc some ppl are adversely affected by it. The right argument would be to push for a better system and more checks and balances to make sure we minimize these unintended harmful consequences of the laws, its not to do away with the law altogether. That same logic applies here, it\u2019s entirely ignorant to use a case like this to argue against a law\u2019s existence bc the only valid thing it can support is an argument to clean up the law to make sure ppl like this arent wrongfully getting caught up in it. In no valid line of logic does this provide support to the argument that the law shouldn\u2019t exist. If thats your argument you need to also be pushing to do away with any law that unfairly affects someone, aka you better be supporting murder being legal bc some ppl are punished unfairly under it.","created_utc":1730617025000,"comment_id":"lv3ctkv","parent_id":"t3_1gh6au5","score":0,"submission_id":"1gh6au5"}

(Roughly 1 million women in the U.S. meet these standards )\n\n*Just a fun fact, but this number of women is roughly the same as active female content creators on Onlyfans, a number nearly equal to the total force of the entire US Army, which is some interesting commentary on the state of our culture.*\n\nThere's no easy way to correlate the two statistics, so please view it only anecdotally, but what this throws some weight behind is that for any man who desires a level of modesty or privacy in their relationship, that their chances of finding a satisfying relationship are even slimmer. Our society has shifted away from a lot of values that brought people a sense of security and safety in their relationships, and now the dating scene reflects that change in values.\n\nWhen you consider additional differences in religion, political views, or just plain old character compatibility, dating at this time is really, really difficult.\n\nGuys these days really do have it hard, and women don't understand it because their view of the dating pool is different. Women get twice as many matches on dating apps, but only initiate a third of relationships.\n\nMen are frustrated emotionally, romantically and physically, and consequently the consumption of pornographic material has skyrocketed, which further contributes to a variety of intimacy issues and unhealthy and unrealistic romantic expectations.\n\nIt's of course unfair for men to turn around and blame this all entirely on women, or to verbally berate or attack them for all the petty stuff that goes around, but I just wanted to explain where a lot of the anger and resentment is coming from. It doesn't make it right at all, and I don't condone bad behavior in any sort, but I just wanted to share some of its underlying current.\n\nGuys are hurting, and they live in a society that terribly fails to understand their troubles or needs on the most basic of social, emotional and romantic levels. This same culture is similarly destructive towards the representation and interactions that women receive, which is creating a feedback loop of toxicity and unrealistic expectations.\n\n(Disclaimer: Again, I don't support attacking women or disparaging them in any way. If you're a guy and you're reading this and you think \"Oh man, we do have it bad, and I'm frustrated so I'm going to go blame it on women and be a jerk!\" Then just stop and imagine how much less attractive and functional a bad attitude makes you.

This means a lot of men just aren\u2019t getting dates, since they haven\u2019t grown to better themselves to be considerate, caring, faithful partners.\n\nIn general, some women who want kids are preferring to date men who have decent jobs, a car, and are financially responsible.
