From a strawman representation of \"the left\" by people on \"the right\"?\n\nAnecdotally, I am very left wing liberal, hang out in pretty much only lefty lib spaces on the web and other media, all my friends are lefty libs, i live in one of the leftiest of lefty lib states, and I can think i literally ZERO people in these spaces that ever say they hate any humans\\[1\\], let alone \"men\"\n\n  \n\\[1\\] Two exceptions being: Donald J Trump and Hitler.

It must be all the democrats fault posts. \n\nI'm starting to think some of these young men are hoping a handsmaid tale type of society will come about with trump's help, and they will all be given a woman.","created_utc":1732262420000,"comment_id":"lybzx4h","parent_id":"t3_1gwpnb8","score":5,"submission_id":"1gwpnb8"}

{"author":"actuallyacatmow","body":">I have sympathy for feminism and womens rights but why is hard for many of them and those in the left in general to see some young men and yes even some incels as victims in a changing culture?\n\nCan I turn this on it's head for you a little?\n\nYou're frustrated that women and the left don't see men as 'victims'. I'm figuring this is the reason you and other men struggle to have sympathy for feminism. You feel left behind behind and are frustrated that your plight isn't being heard.\n\nHowever you don't seem to extend this empathy to the other side. If there was a law that came into congress tomorrow that was the equivalent of banning abortion for men, pushed by feminists, you would feel very frustrated correct? Say forced vascetomies for all men above the age of 13. It would make you not want to support feminists, correct? In fact, you'd be very angry at this invasion of your body. Now imagine, after this law was passed, you stumbled across a thread about women complaining about the harm men do and complaints about how they don't do enough to support them. They cite examples that aren't true. You're understandably livid.\n\nCan you maybe see how asking a disfranchized group to be extra special nice to their historical oppressors could be very frustrating and not effective?","created_utc":1732253768000,"comment_id":"lyba3tv","parent_id":"t3_1gwpnb8","score":8,"submission_id":"1gwpnb8"}
