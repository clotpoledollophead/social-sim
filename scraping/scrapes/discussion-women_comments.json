For context I\u2019m not a short woman. I\u2019m 5\u20197. My criteria was \u201cas long as you can handle my love of heels and not be insecure about it\u201d. First bf was but I was also 17 and that didn\u2019t last very long. No one after ever cared.\n\nI\u2019ve also never met any woman in my life that actually rejected a man for his height. Things like height are one of the more negotiable standards women have on their lists. Women have their standards and some, like \u201cis he empathetic?\u201d \u201cDoes he have the same views I do?\u201d \u201cDoes he like cats?\u201d and those are usually non-negotiable. You\u2019ll notice that they\u2019re personality based. There are some, like physical appearance that are a bit fuzzier but still play a factor. I\u2019m not going to naively say that looks don\u2019t matter at all. They just gotta be handsome to some. Admittedly, I am one of those people.\n\nHeight though? That\u2019s one of the least enforced standards. Women like to be made to feel small and dainty and protected. It\u2019s all about the patriarchal society we live in. It\u2019s the view that taller men are better protectors and providers. If you pick a fight, you might feel like your odds are better against the 5\u20199 dude than the 6\u20194 dude. You could be very very wrong but that\u2019s the common assumption hahahaha.\n\nAnyway, if a woman meets a guy and he\u2019s kind, funny, confident, handsome, etc. she will usually not care if he\u2019s under 6ft. \n\nI can\u2019t say the same for if he\u2019s shorter than her specifically, that can be more of a dealbreaker. The average female height is something like 5\u20194 or 5\u20195 I think so it\u2019s pretty rare to find a man shorter than that. Even then, women who are 4\u201911 and 5\u20190 are pretty common. \n\nYou\u2019ll hear women say they won\u2019t date under 6. They absolutely will far more often than not. They can say that now and then they meet a 5\u20199 guy who has the personality of a god. Cuz dudes under 6ft usually develop amazing personalities.\n\nThat\u2019s my two cents :)","created_utc":1697660229000,"comment_id":"k5e4zu8","parent_id":"t3_17aljsg","score":5,"submission_id":"17aljsg"}

{"author":"Librekrieger","body":"Individual liberty is probably higher on the priority list of progressives than it is to conservatives. Your premise assumes something that isn't true in reality.\n\nMost conservatives want the almost completely unfettered right of individuals to think, believe, and speak. But with regard to ACTIONS, they also prioritize both individual and tribal purity and avoidance of harm to others.\n\nRead Jonathan Haidt's \"The Righteous Mind\" if you really want to understand this.\n\nProgressives are almost exclusively about freedom of conscience AND action as long as those actions don't harm another person in some direct, measurable way. Conservatives would normally consider actions that spread disease, like sex of any flavor outside of marriage, to be a harm. (The insanity about masks is an anomaly, a specific response by Trumpists in the face of a disease they regarded as a hoax; non-Trumpist conservatives had no trouble at all accepting masks).\n\nConservatives tend to strongly believe that children are something to be protected, period. That a pregnant woman is as obliged to protect the health of the developing human inside as she will be once it's outside her. It makes no more sense to talk about terminating that life before birth than it does to talk about terminating it after birth. To a conservative, if A leads directly to B and B is a consequence you don't want, logic requires that you don't do A. There's only one way to get pregnant, so if you don't want to be pregnant, you don't do that thing. So as for \"having control over their own bodies\", conservatives very much wish that people would control their own bodies, yes. If you don't want ripples in the pond, don't throw the rock. Cause and effect. (As crazy as Trumpists go if you suggest they wear a mask, that's how progressives react if you suggest they not have sex. They lose their minds over it.)\n\nGender identity and sexuality are very easily understood if you understand that the conservative position is strongly aligned with the idea of a Judeo-Christian God. If God created people as man and woman, it's very clear how the parts work. If you believe God built you for a purpose, it's impossible to square that with the idea that a person can be born into the \"wrong\" body.\n\nAll of the above is just a view through a keyhole into how conservatives think on a few issues. I'm not a traditional conservative, but my whole family is. Their beliefs and logic are just as self-consistent as your own, in fact maybe more so because they've been formed over a longer period of time.\n\nAs for why people get so uptight about certain things, that must vary from person to person. I see progressives get just as uptight about stuff as conservatives, for the most part. (The Hillsborough Baptists are an exception, I really can't fathom those people or what might be going on in their heads.) The only thing I get uptight about is if someone tries to force me to believe or speak a certain way. Unlike a lot of conservatives, I keep my cool as long as I can speak my mind.","created_utc":1701986564000,"comment_id":"kcd6cwm","parent_id":"t3_18cs60s","score":3,"submission_id":"18cs60s"}

I know it may be hard to look at it that way, but you can better defeat your enemy if you actually choose to understand them.\n\nAs for gender identity, they believe that you can believe you\u2019re whatever gender you want to be. It\u2019s America, do what you want. However the second you start trying to make them call you whatever you want to be called, that\u2019s where they have a problem. Because now you\u2019re trying to make THEM do something YOU want them to do. They view that as coerced speech, which in a way is true. Most of us are just polite and go along with whatever you want.\n\nThe other problem they have is when gender identity interferes with women\u2019s rights. They don\u2019t think males should competed against females, and that their female children shouldn\u2019t have to share a bathroom with a grown man.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with everything they believe, but I truly believe that if you take the time to listen and understand your enemy, it gives you more power to reason with them and find some common ground so that we can all move forward together.\n\nI can already see there is a lot of generalized untrue thoughts towards conservatives here, so I\u2019d like to reiterate that these are not my beliefs, these are just the beliefs I\u2019ve heard from conservatives I\u2019ve actually met in public and not just in the internet.","created_utc":1702037202000,"comment_id":"kcgjl76","parent_id":"t3_18cs60s","score":5,"submission_id":"18cs60s"}

I say this as a pro-choice conservative, I don't support their stance there but it is what it is.\n\nThey see gender identity as doublespeak. Through their conservatism, they still see sex as entirely equal to gender, so it's like asking them to call a blue ball a red ball. It's confusing, though the polite ones will still do it in person despite any complaints they may have deep down.\n\nBecause 'gender' as a concept, as a progressive or trans person sees it doesn't exist to a conservative, they see gender affirming care as just plain and simple mutilation and self harm. If you wanna read a headline like they would, just replace 'gender affirming care' with 'lobotomy' or 'assisted self-harm and mutilation', and 'hormone treatments' with 'chemical sterilization'. There are some conservatives I know who think that in a few decades, people who currently view themselves as trans will sue healthcare providers for permanently mutilating them. It's essentially seen as the second coming of lobotomy as a medical treatment. The more libertarian ones won't be pushing for criminalization of it for adults, but they will still see it as self-harm and mutilation. The less libertarian ones will be trying to 'reduce self-harm and mutilation' actively through government overreach.\n\nAs for the ones who are up-tight about homosexuality? The things old conservatives were taught in school about lgbt people weren't the best. It was propaganda, but propaganda sticks. They think it's a powerful disease vector too, despite that being way overblown. Some of it will be religious dogma, which sadly overrides their ideology somewhat. Some will be critical of the lgbt flag just due to the association with progressivism (I have seen european conservatives praise the old rainbow flag as fine, while being critical of the new one, for instance), which could be taken as an anti-lgbt stance, when it's really against progressivism as a whole.

{"author":"henryhumper","body":"I should preface this by saying that I personally am fully pro-choice and think abortion should be legal and a decision made between a woman and her doctor.\n\nBut if you're pro-life, making a specific exception for rape-caused pregnancies is a morally contradictory and illogical position. Pro-lifers believe that a fetus (at any stage of development) is a person with an inherent right to life. That's the fundamental basis for why they think abortion is wrong and should be illegal - because it terminates the life of what they consider to be a person. \n\nThe circumstances of a fetus' conception are irrelevant to the question of whether it is, or is not, a person. Whether it was conceived by a loving & committed couple, an anonymous one-night stand, or a violent rape, the biological end result is the same: sperm meets egg, DNA combines into new human zygote, fetal development proceeds. As long as it's healthy and there are no complications or outside interventions, it will eventually develop into a baby and be born. \n\nSo if you're a pro-lifer who makes an exception for rape pregnancies, you have already conceded that your belief in fetal personhood is not absolute and that there are non-medical circumstances in which it is morally acceptable to \"kill\" an innocent \"person\". Which then begs the question of why *rape* entitles a woman to make the choice end her pregnancy, but not other reasons?. Is a fetus *less* human because its father raped its mother? Is it not a person even though, biologically-speaking, it's no different than a consensually-conceived fetus? Does it have fewer rights because of what its father did? These are questions you have to ask yourself if you're a pro-lifer who believes in rape exemptions.","created_utc":1702016825000,"comment_id":"kcf8jac","parent_id":"t3_18d1c93","score":3,"submission_id":"18d1c93"}

{"author":"riddlerisme3","body":"I\u2019ll probably get downvoted because people won\u2019t understand what I\u2019m getting at, but oh well here\u2019s my two cents. \nI have a hard time taking your view that it\u2019s extremely harmful to view men as the main perpetrators of domestic violence, some of which are actually addressed in the article you linked. \n\nA few reasons being that: \n\n- the research used appears to be fairly new, no more than a decade and some change old. Historically men were absolutely the main perpetrators of domestic abuse and violence, and women had no protection or options. \nIt wasn\u2019t even legal to divorce your husband even if he was beating the fuck out of you until 1925. Still not very helpful, since women still couldn\u2019t own property in most places or even open a bank account (until the 1960s) without their husband\u2019s permission, or have a career the way a man could; so financially and socially speaking, leaving still wasn\u2019t even an option for most battered women. \nSo it follows there\u2019s a reason why men are currently still seen as the main culprits, because historically it has always been true. As the research is now showing a trend towards the opposite, those beliefs and views will naturally change.   \n\n- the severity of the outcomes is still the more important factor in terms of determining who is the bigger problem, compared to the straight numbers and data relating strictly to rates of occurrence and demographics. Violent men kill their partners, and sometimes children, all the time. \nThere would be some very different statistics represented if we were talking about domestic violence leading to permanent injury and intimate partner homicide and infanticide, which would give a larger picture as to why men are still seen as the biggest problem in this issue, despite the statistics shown in your article. \n2 out of 5 female murder victims are killed by an intimate partner, and women represent 96% of victims of intimate partner homicide. \nAnd men are overwhelming still the primary perpetrators of spousal rape, which is a form of violence and partner abuse just as serious as physical abuse. \n\n- the majority of women who use violence against their male partners are battered themselves. It\u2019s found most women who use violence are more often retaliating or defending themselves from an abusive partner. \nAnd there are many studies which speak to the contrary that men who abuse their partners aren\u2019t motivated by anger; not to mention all the court ordered therapy and anger management programs filled with angry abusive men. \n After working for a time at a criminal defence law firm, it\u2019s difficult for me to believe the data from the studies they used is very entirely accurate regarding that point. These things are heavily explored and researched when it comes to building a defence case in a criminal matter, because determining the state of mind, motivation and intent of the accused is extremely important. \nWithout reading the studies themselves, I\u2019m having one hell of a time figuring out how they concluded that men who commit physical abuse don\u2019t almost always do so out of anger. I\u2019d have to see if they have any other alternative explanation. Self Defense is briefly addressed, but I can\u2019t see that representing a significant number of cases. \n\n- lastly, these numbers are just based on what is reported. Many battered women have a tendency to hide the abuse they face and don\u2019t report it for many reasons, a few being they are terrified of their abuser harming them more if they seek help, and\/or they are being heavily controlled\/abused in some other way that prevents them from reporting it. Women who are physically abused by a male partner are in the most danger when they try to leave or seek help, because the loss of control usually causes an escalation in violence from the abuser. \nAnd a lot of the findings in the article seem to heavily rely on self reported admissions, so it\u2019s not strongly conclusive data. \n\nThat all being said, intimate partner abuse is serious and wrong regardless of the gender of the perpetrator, and men should absolutely be taken seriously and equally given help and supported to speak up if a female partner is abusing them. \n\nI would have to say it\u2019s not the views about the perpetrators of abuse that is harmful; it\u2019s the discrepancies in regards to the level of support provided to victims of partner abuse based on their gender which is harmful, and needs to be changed.","created_utc":1703142240000,"comment_id":"ke8x1ox","parent_id":"t3_18n4d66","score":33,"submission_id":"18n4d66"}
{"author":"Able-Distribution","body":"Others have made similar points, but at the risk of being repetitive I'll chime in:\n\nI am skeptical that women are more violent than men in domestic relationships.\n\nSimply put, when I walk down a dark street in a bad neighborhood at night, I'm not looking over my shoulder for women.\n\n1. My first question is: \"why should I believe these numbers \\[28.3% vs. 21.6%\\] at all?\" The database they come from, \"The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge,\" says that it includes over 1700 peer-reviewed studies, I'd like to know how those studies were selected, what studies were left out, how the database went about aggregating the studies, etc.\n2. Assume that the numbers \\[28.3% vs. 21.6%\\] are \"real.\" My second question is: \"what exactly do they represent?\" Are all incidents of domestic violence counted equally? If a woman throws a flower-vase at a man, and a man buries a hatchet in a woman's skull, do both count as a single instance of domestic violence? If a man hits a woman and a woman hits him back, is that two instances of DV?\n3. My third question is: \"Could there be issues with reporting that skew the data in weird ways?\" For example, maybe lesbian couples are more prone to calling the police when quarreling than either straight or gay-male couples, which might pump the numbers on \"female perpetrated\" DV. Or maybe female perpetrated violence gets reported at a higher rate precisely because it's unusual (\"man bites dog\").\n\nThese are all just questions, of course, not definitive reasons to doubt the numbers. My basic reason for doubting remains, again, my simple observation that when I walk down a dark street, I'm not checking over my shoulder for women.","created_utc":1703143058000,"comment_id":"ke8z1xq","parent_id":"t3_18n4d66","score":17,"submission_id":"18n4d66"}

Possible, but compared to the alternative?\n\nWell, in a state where trans people are required to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, both a premeditated rapist and a rapist of opportunity would have a much easier time. They\u2019d be able to go out dressed as men, without any potential discomfort, without the material cost of buying things, and then they could just go \u201cwhat a pity, I\u2019m a trans man and the law *requires* me to use this women\u2019s bathroom, such a shame, but oh well!\u201d And then they\u2019ll have the excuse to let them in!

They blame women for being bad when they have just allowed bad women in their lives. \n\n\nShare your expectations with a partner early and respectfully demand they treat you with dignity and equitable reciprocity. \n\nI am a woman, I don't get taken advantage of even though people would because I tell them no. I don't want to be around you bc you do this this and this, if you want this to work you'll have to compromise with me or change your perspective.\n\nMen should do the same thing with women they meet. Hold firm expectations, you don't have to be mean to say, this is what I want from a relationship if you're not willing to give it then this will not work out for us. \n\nYou won't have people taking advantage of you if you recognize what it looks like and know what a good relationship would look like to you. You can then evaluate your choic s and your relationship for changes to make so you are happy and comfortable.\n\nBe honest and treat others with dignity and hold them accountable when they don't reciprocate by demanding compromise or a change or maybe it just won't work out. But this is a man's problem bc they dont hold partners accountable \n\nWomen from houses with poor emotional skills also deal with this, men are socialized to have poor emotional skills so many get caught in this trap of waiting for a good person rather than building a relationship and choosing a good candidate","created_utc":1703211001000,"comment_id":"kecqins","parent_id":"t3_18ns0ko","score":3,"submission_id":"18ns0ko"}

The downside is sometimes this turns into toxic echo chambers where everyone is reassuring each other that it is okay to be a complete asshole. Generally coming up for air from insular communities is helpful.\n\nAlso sometimes it is a good thing just to listen. Often the intrusive voice is stupidly self-confident that they can cynically see the obvious solution to the problem all these morons have without understanding the problem. Sometimes they outright can\u2019t understand the problem. I didn\u2019t GET why racism was a problem until I started really listening to the experiences of my friends. Not explaining them away or playing devil\u2019s advocate or minimizing but just listening. The thing is when you start to actually listen people open up and it is amazing what you can learn.","created_utc":1703237606000,"comment_id":"keemwjk","parent_id":"t3_18o231u","score":2,"submission_id":"18o231u"}

It\u2019s completely legal in Islam to beat your wife ) \n\nWhat most people don\u2019t understand is that all of those third world countries they are thinking about - are Islamic third world countries. \n\nAlso their views on rape. \n\nIn Islamic cultures and also like where there is a heavy Islamic influence like India - ( India is about half Muslim) if women go outside without a male relative and if they are not covered ? Then they are asking for sexual attention- the teaching comes from the Hadiths when the prophet made the law of women being covered so they would not drive men crazy with lust by showing their hair. \n\nIn Islamic countries if you get raped? \n\nMarry your rapist or spend ten years in prison . Get flogged. Publicly. \n\nSo men in the west are not as bad \u2026 \n\nAnd the law protects women in the west. \n\nIn the west , women chose to stay at home. Have babies. Get married. They do not have to do that. At all. \n\nIn Islamic countries - women can\u2019t even leave the house without permission and an escort from a man - that\u2019s the law. They can\u2019t speak to the opposite sex - that\u2019s the law. They cannot marry who they want. That\u2019s the law. They can\u2019t go to school without dad \/brother\/husband\/uncle\/ permission past the age of 12- that\u2019s the law. \n\nIn Saudi Arabia for example every man wears a beeper. If his wife or one of his wives show up at a border trying to cross it? He is beeped. To call back and be told about it. He can give her permission from there or have her arrested and brought back home. No woman crosses a border without husband being beeped.\n\nThis makes the entire attitude different .. \n\nWomen in the west are extremely powerful compared.\n\nHaving the law on your side makes western women powerful. And really it\u2019s their choice not to be powerful in the west. \n\nNo one is making them not be powerful. \n\n\nI could go on and on with this.

Here are my thoughts on exactly what you are describing:\u00a0\n\nTrump supporters, I am not trying to blast you here, and I know that people don't like this comparison, but he really does seem to be doing a lot of what Hitler did.\n\nAt first, people laughed at the Nazis. They started as small groups and gangs that would terrorize Jews, much like the Proud Boys or the actual Neo-Nazis. They scapegoated the Jews for Germany's problems, and dehumanized them. On this platform, the Germans that were not Jewish were held free of guilt and promised a shining future, which appealed to many weary Germans. Today, we promise a brighter future to \"real Americans\", who feel the instability in their lives and we and scapegoat immigrants, particularly Latinos, despite research showing they are about as problematic as the rest of the population in terms of crime.\n\nThe Nazis grew in power. Germans denied jobs to the Jews, stole their property, and tried to push the \"Juden raus\". Jews were being pushed out of Germany and being told to go home. They were seen as genetically inferior, or \"bad blood\". Today, our president elect promises to send illegal immigrants, potentially those whose birthright makes them American from immigrant families back to the countries they left. This may be enforced through ID checks on anybody who does not pass for a \"real American\".\n\nWhat started as gang violence became legally legitimized as Hitler rose to political power, appointed his loyal followers, and changed laws to enact his will. Today, we have a elected a president that is now unable to be held legally responsible for his crimes, who is appointing loyal celebrities and family members, despite their appalling lack of qualifications and care for this country.\u00a0\n\nDisagreeing thinkers, educators, and writers were targeted as well, as their truths were seen as a threat to Hitler's power. The \"Lugepresse\", or lying press, were especially hated. Today, Trump bashes the \"lying press\" and even makes thinly veiled threats towards them.\n\nHomosexuals and the disabled were seen as genetically inferior, and sent to concentration camps with the Jews and thinkers. Even the homosexuals that loyally served Hitler were no exception. And to the end of breeding for perceived superiority, Aryan women were put into programs to mate with Aryan men and produce purely Aryan babies. Many of the Jews were experimented upon, if they were not worked to death or gassed. Today, homophobia and transphobia is politically acceptable. Women see multiple predators elected and appointed to office, and there is discussion of panels to monitor their pregnancies and miscarriages. Abortion rights are being removed.\n\nAnd if you think we are not capable of sending millions of souls to concentration camps, just know that we are responsible for the Japanese interment, where Asians were sent to labor camps simply because of their race. Many of these camps are still standing, particularly in the west, and can be visited, if you are curious.\n\nIf you are a Trump supporter, I implore you to consider these things, before you too fall on the wrong side of history.","created_utc":1736921844000,"comment_id":"m768res","parent_id":"t3_1i1asj4","score":9,"submission_id":"1i1asj4"}

{"author":"w3woody","body":"There's a real rabbit hole here you can fall down into. (That is, there is a lot of hard feelings, strong opinions, and even political stuff wrapped into this question.)\n\nAt the root of this, however, falls early feminist writings from folks like Simone de Beauvoir, who observed in part that culture considers men as [\"transcendent\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transcendence_\\(philosophy\\)) (or that which 'becomes') and women as [\"imminent\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Immanence) (or that which 'is').\n\nSo, for example, men have careers; women have jobs. (A career has the possibility of a forward progression or path to promotion and becoming 'more'; while a 'job' is just something you 'have.') Women are praised for what they *are* (beauty, dress, clearness of skin), while men are praised for what they *can become* (powerful, moving forward). \n\nWomen are \"objectified\"--and not just \"boobs\" and \"ass\", but regarded as objects to be 'owned' by men, who run families and move the world.\n\nHer argument was that these things are just social constructs--and worse, constructs we cement in place by using pejoratives to describe those who fall outside of these boundaries. (So a man is  'opinionated'; a woman is 'a bitch.')\n\n(Note the reverse is true; a woman who dresses masculine is seen as 'butch'--while a man who dresses feminine is seen as less than a man: effeminate, 'gay', a 'sissy.')\n\n**Note: I'm describing the status quo, not my own opinions, nor if the status quo is correct or not.**\n\n----\n\nNow I suspect the reason why people get angry when asked this is because of two things. First, they may not be aware of the underlying theory and may just be using the \"I know it when I see it\" school of thought.\n\nSecond, a lot of the things we negatively associate to women (or to men) are things that can be uncomfortable to talk about. For example, I'm a male but I grew my hair out fairly long and a high pitched voice. And it's a little awkward when I get referred to as \"sweetheart\" or \"miss sunshine\"--though thus far no-one has grabbed my ass thinking I was a woman.","created_utc":1697450516000,"comment_id":"k528mos","parent_id":"t3_178tupu","score":7,"submission_id":"178tupu"}

{"author":"jedburghofficial","body":"This is very plausible.  I think all along, people have been making an unspoken assumption that they can edit out or minimize trump's involvement when they release any files.  But if that's harder than they thought, it would explain a lot.  Certainly it would explain why they're backtracking.\n\nAnd when you think about it, Trump did have some oddly relevant behaviors and connections.  He was very active in beauty pageants back in the day, especially teen pageants.  For many years, he had his own modeling agency, and connections with modeling agents like John Casablancas, Jean-Luc Brunel and Paolo Zampolli.  All of these ventures involved scandals and controversy.\n\nAnd Epstein was involved too.  Both Zampolli and Epstein claim to have introduced Trump to Melania.  All of them had their own connections to Epstein.  Trump even hosted an odd event for calendar girls that had Epstein as its only guest.  And, of course, Trump was accused of assaulting a woman there, in Ivanka's bedroom of all places.\n\nThe fact is, there was a circle of people like modeling agents associated with Epstein, many of them bringing young women into the US.  And Trump was one of them.  Apart from having an agency of his own, you can't read about any of these connections without Trump's name coming up, over and over again. \n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump\\_Model\\_Management](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump_Model_Management)\n\n[https:\/\/theintellectualistofficial.substack.com\/p\/trump-and-the-elite-modeling-scandal](https:\/\/theintellectualistofficial.substack.com\/p\/trump-and-the-elite-modeling-scandal)\n\n[https:\/\/medium.com\/@mentificium\/formerly-sealed-documents-in-maxwell-epstein-case-ordered-released-96db77a77c74](https:\/\/medium.com\/@mentificium\/formerly-sealed-documents-in-maxwell-epstein-case-ordered-released-96db77a77c74)\n\n[https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/former-modeling-agent-reveals-details-about-melania-trumps-visa\/](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/former-modeling-agent-reveals-details-about-melania-trumps-visa\/)\n\n[https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/fact-check\/jeffrey-epstein-trumps-introduce\/](https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/fact-check\/jeffrey-epstein-trumps-introduce\/)\n\n[https:\/\/au.news.yahoo.com\/trumps-calendar-girls-party-had-172948611.html](https:\/\/au.news.yahoo.com\/trumps-calendar-girls-party-had-172948611.html)\n\n[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/10\/09\/opinion\/sunday\/donald-trump-groper-in-chief.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/10\/09\/opinion\/sunday\/donald-trump-groper-in-chief.html)","created_utc":1753155733000,"comment_id":"n4ec8qc","parent_id":"t3_1m5qnzi","score":7,"submission_id":"1m5qnzi"}

{"author":"ProbablyLongComment","body":"I don't *think so,* but I don't know, and that's terrifying.\n\nThe main thing I'm holding onto, is that Congress and the Supreme Court are full of semi-rational adults, at least in part.  They're not great, but they're not all burn-the-country-to-the-ground crazy.  Some of the proposed Project 2025 stuff, for example, is going to be recognized by some congressional Republicans as dangerous, and a bad idea.  They may be excited because it supports conservatives *for now,* but many of these things are double edged swords, and could absolutely destroy the GOP if things shift the other way.\n\nI don't hold much respect for congressional Republicans, but I at least trust that they have a sense of self-preservation.  Things may get a lot worse for America in the coming term, but I don't think that things will be irreparable--at least in Washington.  Will there be a civil war?  I think it's unlikely, but it's definitely a possibility.\n\nEven if Trump somehow manages to seize total, unlimited power, he won't be alive forever.  He can do a *lot* of damage, but even conservative voters will only tolerate so much.  While every conservative will favor Trump over Biden, there are a lot of conservatives that don't want to see an unchecked and all-powerful Trump administration.  Many of those conservatives are in Congress, and I would suspect there are a couple in the Supreme Court.\n\nI am not at all saying things look good; things have never looked so dark.  But I think that ultimately, Congress is going to be hesitant to give Trump the kind of unilateral power that Project 2025 is aiming for.","created_utc":1720013217000,"comment_id":"lbegp0r","parent_id":"t3_1du62rp","score":19,"submission_id":"1du62rp"}

{"author":"PoohTrailSnailCooch","body":"Here's a breakdown with verified sources and current context (April 2025):\n\n---\n\n**\u201cPardons all violent Jan 6th criminals\u201d**  \nTrue. Trump issued full pardons for over 1,500 people connected to January 6, including violent offenders like Proud Boys and Oath Keepers leaders ([The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/live\/2025\/apr\/23\/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates)).\n\n---\n\n**\u201c2 Israeli ceasefires collapse\u201d**  \nPartially true. A Trump-backed ceasefire in Gaza did collapse in early 2025 after a short calm. The administration initially took credit, then reversed course and lifted sanctions while backing Israel\u2019s resumed strikes ([The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/live\/2025\/apr\/23\/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates)).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cUkrainian ceasefire collapse\/fail to launch\u201d**  \nAccurate. Trump tried to broker a peace deal that involved recognizing Russia\u2019s control over Crimea. Ukraine rejected the terms and talks stalled out ([The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2025\/apr\/23\/the-guardian-view-on-us-russian-talks-trump-wants-a-deal-whatever-it-means-for-ukraine), [The Times](https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/article\/washington-abandon-ukraine-talks-ceasefire-russia-6sbkklmbj)).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cWar with Houthis \/ Signal Gate 1.0 & 2.0\u201d**  \nMisleading. The US did carry out strikes on Houthi targets like the Ras Isa terminal, but there\u2019s no formal operation called \u201cSignal Gate.\u201d That\u2019s just a nickname floating around social media ([AP](https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/yemen-us-airstrikes-563f61bbd96e1f2de68373fdf76c8811)).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cLets Houthis shoot down 10+ Reaper drones\u201d**  \nMostly true. At least six US MQ-9 drones have been confirmed shot down by Houthis recently. But \"lets\" implies intentional neglect, which isn't supported by the evidence ([ABC News](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/houthis-shoot-growing-number-us-drones\/story?id=121099082)).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cThreatens invasion of allies\u201d**  \nTrue. In addition to encouraging Russia to \"do whatever they want\" to NATO members who don't meet defense spending targets ([CNN](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2024\/02\/10\/politics\/trump-russia-nato\/index.html)), Trump also explicitly said in 2019 that \"military force is not off the table\" when Denmark refused to sell Greenland to the US ([PBS](https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/politics\/trump-says-military-force-not-off-the-table-for-greenland-after-danish-fms-scolding-remarks)). These statements were interpreted as aggressive threats by both allies and media, and were condemned internationally.\n\n---\n\n**\u201cThreatens war with Iran\u201d**  \nTrue. Trump publicly said military action was on the table if Iran didn\u2019t accept terms on a new nuclear deal ([Reuters](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/trump-says-there-will-be-bombing-if-iran-does-not-make-nuclear-deal-2025-03-30)).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cThreatens NATO alliance\u201d**  \nTrue. He openly said the US wouldn\u2019t defend NATO members that don\u2019t meet spending targets, confirming previous skepticism about alliance commitments ([Reuters](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/trump-if-nato-members-dont-pay-us-wont-defend-them-2025-03-07)).\n\n---\n\n**\u201cDoes Russia\u2019s bidding \/ pulls Ukraine aid\u201d**  \nMostly true. Military aid to Ukraine has been paused under Trump, and his proposed peace plan heavily favored Russian terms ([The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2025\/mar\/04\/us-military-aid-ukraine-pause-trump-zelenskyy-updates)).\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nThere\u2019s truth in here, and a lot of it is serious. But the original post lumps together rhetoric, action, speculation, and memes into one list like it\u2019s all proven policy. If you're gonna criticize Trump, do it with receipts.

So although people still break the law, eg by murdering, less people commit murder than would do if it was legal, thus overall more lives are saved.\n\nHe considers the unborn to be human lives, so is using the same premise- the number of unborn lives saved is worth the increased strain on the criminal justice system because it will deter at least some women from getting an abortion","created_utc":1705728237000,"comment_id":"kinc383","parent_id":"t3_19arxpy","score":2,"submission_id":"19arxpy"}

{"author":"GunMuratIlban","body":"The problem is, both sides are looking at this exactly how it suits them.\n\nYou are just as much of a side in this by the way.\n\n>Here\u2019s what we do know:\n\n>She\u2019s not trans. She\u2019s from Algeria, where sex reassignment surgery is not permitted and LGBT culture is seen as bad.\n\nI'm from Turkey, where operations like gender change or abortion are not permitted and LGBT culture is seen as bad.\n\nStill lots of people go through gender surgeries and abortions, even high profile celebrities. What is permitted and what gets done are not the same, more so in MENA countries.\n\nSo, does that mean she indeed is trans and went through such operations? No, yet being from Algeria certainly does not prove she didn't go through sex reassaignment.\n\n>She has female body parts. It says she is a female on her birth certificate after her mother gave birth, doctors saw she had female body parts and were like \u201cyup, it\u2019s a girl.\u201d\n\nWere you there with the doctors at the time? How can you be so certain about all this?\n\nThe strongest argument right now that she's intersex. Which is a very complicated condition when it comes to sports. \n\nAgain, none of it is certain, organizations have been making contrasting decisions on her eligibility. \n\nSo no, at this point none of us can 100% claim that she's a male, trans or the details of her condition. \n\n>She likely has elevated testosterone levels. There\u2019s no specific test out there that we can read the results of, but we can assume she\u2019s telling the truth.\n\nHow can we assume that? \n\nThere have been conflicting claims about her testesterone levels. We cannot assume anything, people can lie, organizations can too.\n\nNot saying she's lying, can't assume she's telling the truth either.\n\n>Here\u2019s what we don\u2019t know: Her chromosomal makeup. \n\n>So back to what we know: the IBA, a Russian organization, permitted her to fight in a tournament, and only banned her AFTER she beat a Russian\u2014citing an \u201cunspecified genetic test\u201d that they refuse to give ANY information on. People are referencing this ban and automatically assume she has an XY makeup.\n\nOh come on now...\n\nSo what, she beats a Russian athlete and the whole International Boxing Association decides to frame her? You talk about how far fetched theories people can believe in, yet you present the most far fetched one yourself.\n\nImane herself chose to withdrew their case from Court of Arbitration for Sport. Which doesn't prove anything; but certainly strongly suggests the whole situation isn't as clear cut as you might choose to believe.\n\n>The IOC says her testosterone levels were low enough to compete.\n\nAlthough I've never seen IOC making a direct statement about her testesterone levels; there are certainly conflicting decisions by both organizations. Thus, creating controversy.\n\n>She\u2019s also lost to women 9 times, so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s some invincible Mike Tyson fighting small women.\n\nI'm a male, who did some boxing in college. Yet I'm not going to beat every single female I'd box with. \n\nAn amateur female boxer can beat me, despite I would likely to have a considerably stronger punch. That's very important; but isn't everything. \n\nA female boxer with better fundementals, better plan and execution could most certainly beat me. \n\nSo even if Imane was a male, not even intersex.

{"author":"ConfidentDragon","body":"This is very difficult topic. I'd like to see some well defined rules of who can compete in which category. Is the testosterone level it? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Where do you put the limit?\n\n\nOne option is to put the threshold right in between average male and female levels. But then you are guaranteed to have some outliers that are like women, but on steroids.\n\n\nYou can push the threshold closer to the women's mean, but that would cut out lot of athletes that have slight natural advantage. Problem is that professional sports is all about outliers. We want to watch extraordinary people who do extraordinary things, so you don't want to filter-out those people from competing.\n\n\nOf course, if you want to watch best of the best, then just watch men's categories. With this logic you would need just one category for each sports which would be dominated by the biggest and strongest men. This isn't perfect solution, because we would have less events to watch. Also, I do find representation to be important. Performance of female athletes is not impressive when compared to professional men, but it's really impressive for a woman. When some girl sees what should be technically attainable when you train really hard, it might inspire her to be better and train really hard. I do find inspiring other people to be better to be important.\n\n\nHowever splitting people to just men and women is very crude approximation. I'm a man, but no matter how much I would train, there is exactly zero chance I would reach Olympic level of power or endurance. Better inspiration for me is some local gym member who started with similar body composition and has similar genetics, but has different training I can get inspiration from. Of course, having too many categories in Olympics would be impractical, so it's always balancing act between viewer interest, inspiration, and practicality.\n\n\nHaving separate women's category also works in terms of attracting viewership. Let's be real here, not everyone watched women's category just because of athleticism. As stated above, watch men's category for that. I'll admit watching women do some sports is more pleasant for some reason than men doing the same sport, even if that's probably not best strategy to farm upvotes on Reddit. Personally I don't find men being attracted to women to be problematic, we are not talking here about some extreme behavior, just some natural level of attraction. At the end of the day, viewers are viewers, and they pay for the show. And it's not a cheap show. Promoters of events realize this.\n\n\nOne interesting idea how to make Olympics more interesting is to pick people at random instead of picking the best. Last time I saw this idea suggested on Reddit, OP was ridiculed really badly. But with right implementation, it would make sense in my opinion.\n\n\n* The picking of tributes would have to be random to avoid selection bias.\n* They would need to receive few weeks of paid training so they have basic competency in the sport and they know the rules, so there is something to watch.\n* It's probably best applicable to team sports. Individual sports would need multiple samples and some statistician would have to create scoring system that would reduce impact of outliers.\n* There would still be category for the best of the best, as that still has some benefits.\n\n\n\nDoing this would have many advantages:\n\n\n* Interest in Olympic games would be higher, as anyone would have small chance to participate.\n* There wouldn't be that much incentive to take performance enhancing drugs. Currently you need to be truly best of the best to win which naturally incentives cheating. But average person doesn't take PEDs, because they are most likely not going to compete in Olympics.\n* You'll get to compare national averages. If the Olympics are about *representing* a country, why do we take outliers (who were often born in different country or don't represent the country), instead of, you know, *representative* sample.\n* The inspirational effect would be higher. Instead of top athletes, who might as well be aliens compared to you, you'll get normal citizens, just like you.","created_utc":1722715865000,"comment_id":"lgae9ti","parent_id":"t3_1einy70","score":0,"submission_id":"1einy70"}

Would take .2 seconds to add on an update to voter registration request while visiting. In fact, the clerks would most likely ask if the newly wed would like to update their registration while going through the process. \n   * Same practice would apply for anyone changing their name. Just hit up the DMV for ten seconds with the original birth certificate and the name change documentation. \n* As a voter of color, who grew up in\/was raised by low income individuals, I know most of us have our birth certificate nearby. And, depending upon the candidate, we'll do whatever it takes to get to the polling booth. *Jumping through hoops to cast a vote isn't anything new to us.* \n\nIt's ***annoying***, absolutely, but it's not a crisis.

{"author":"hematite2","body":"This is why people touting \"well they have exceptions for the health of the mother!\" doesn't work. Because those health exceptions are (deliberately) vague on what actually counts, and doctors aren't qualified to make those legal decisions. They end up only kicking in when the woman is literally dying right there, as opposed to 'health is in imminent danger and could fail at any moment\". Not to mention cases where they know in advancd the fetus is 100% **going** to die, but since it isn't dead **yet** you can't get an abortion, you just have to wait and risk your health (and future fertility) until then.\n\nLook at the Cox case in Texas. A woman knows her fetus is going to die and there's nothing she can do about it. She actually goes to a court, and they rule that she qualifies for a health exception. But then SCOTX intervenes and says 'no, that doesn't count, we'll prosecute anyone who attempts this\". Meanwhile, Cox is in and out of emergency rooms with her health constantly in danger, while courts argue back and forth over her rights compared to an **already dying** fetus.

At 12:38 p.m., Riley\u2019s body was discovered by UGA police in Oconee Forest Park behind Lake Herrick. Her death was caused by blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. The man who not just killed her, but sexually assaulted her, beat her, and then strangled her to death, was an illegal immigrate that was let in by the biden\/harris administration. He has 3 counts of felony murder, one malice murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault with intent to rape, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and tampering with evidence. \n\nIf my options as a women are either to die in a nice hospital bed, or to be sexually assaulted and then brutally and violently murdered, id take dying in a hospital bed with my mother by my side any day. This is what Kamals America looks like, raping and violently murdering women who went out for a nice run bc shes too weak to close our boarder and protect Americans. Add in the things like fentanyl deaths due to drugs passing through the border and there\u2019s no question about which candidate has the far greater death count on their hands. \n\nDying in a hospital under Trump sounds like a dream compared to the death Kamala is offering me. Think about that, cause if i were you id be careful bring up the death toll if youre voting for kamala bc its very hypocritical to turn around and ignore the deaths she has on her hands.\n\nSecond point - https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_wrongful_convictions_in_the_United_States \nConsider this list of wrongful convictions. A number of ppl here were innocent but convicted  and served time in prison due to a wrongful conviction. Is the right course of action to just legalize murder and rape bc under those laws some ppl face unintended and wrong outcomes? Anyone with common sense would say no, that its an absurd argument to say we should do away with the whole law just bc some ppl are adversely affected by it. The right argument would be to push for a better system and more checks and balances to make sure we minimize these unintended harmful consequences of the laws, its not to do away with the law altogether. That same logic applies here, it\u2019s entirely ignorant to use a case like this to argue against a law\u2019s existence bc the only valid thing it can support is an argument to clean up the law to make sure ppl like this arent wrongfully getting caught up in it. In no valid line of logic does this provide support to the argument that the law shouldn\u2019t exist. If thats your argument you need to also be pushing to do away with any law that unfairly affects someone, aka you better be supporting murder being legal bc some ppl are punished unfairly under it.","created_utc":1730617025000,"comment_id":"lv3ctkv","parent_id":"t3_1gh6au5","score":0,"submission_id":"1gh6au5"}

But its not \"only\" about punishing, its about creating a culture of self-inforced conformity\n\nIts the same as sodomy laws used to be. The police couldn't enter your home to find out if you were having gay sex. But the law makes a justification for the public to try and suss out who's gay, to peep in windows and report their neighbors. So now as a gay man, you have to be afraid of showing affection in public, or even holding hands, and you've succesfully created a society where even *completely legal* queerness must be avoided.\n\nSo although a bathroom law may be unenforceable, you're forcing trans people to out ourselves to use the restroom. And if we have to out ourselves, then we're more likely to conform to our AGAB to avoid public ridicule\/violence--even though we wouldn't be breaking a single law. And it goes beyond queer people-- if a cis woman  simply wants to dress or look masculine, or a cis man wants to look feminine, they're *also* forced to conform, even though they were never at risk of actually breaking *any law whatsoever*, and you've succesfully expanded that same self-enforcing conformity beyond what the law actually affects.","created_utc":1711351102000,"comment_id":"kwern0i","parent_id":"t3_1bmwnrq","score":4,"submission_id":"1bmwnrq"}

(Roughly 1 million women in the U.S. meet these standards )\n\n*Just a fun fact, but this number of women is roughly the same as active female content creators on Onlyfans, a number nearly equal to the total force of the entire US Army, which is some interesting commentary on the state of our culture.*\n\nThere's no easy way to correlate the two statistics, so please view it only anecdotally, but what this throws some weight behind is that for any man who desires a level of modesty or privacy in their relationship, that their chances of finding a satisfying relationship are even slimmer. Our society has shifted away from a lot of values that brought people a sense of security and safety in their relationships, and now the dating scene reflects that change in values.\n\nWhen you consider additional differences in religion, political views, or just plain old character compatibility, dating at this time is really, really difficult.\n\nGuys these days really do have it hard, and women don't understand it because their view of the dating pool is different. Women get twice as many matches on dating apps, but only initiate a third of relationships.\n\nMen are frustrated emotionally, romantically and physically, and consequently the consumption of pornographic material has skyrocketed, which further contributes to a variety of intimacy issues and unhealthy and unrealistic romantic expectations.\n\nIt's of course unfair for men to turn around and blame this all entirely on women, or to verbally berate or attack them for all the petty stuff that goes around, but I just wanted to explain where a lot of the anger and resentment is coming from. It doesn't make it right at all, and I don't condone bad behavior in any sort, but I just wanted to share some of its underlying current.\n\nGuys are hurting, and they live in a society that terribly fails to understand their troubles or needs on the most basic of social, emotional and romantic levels. This same culture is similarly destructive towards the representation and interactions that women receive, which is creating a feedback loop of toxicity and unrealistic expectations.\n\n(Disclaimer: Again, I don't support attacking women or disparaging them in any way. If you're a guy and you're reading this and you think \"Oh man, we do have it bad, and I'm frustrated so I'm going to go blame it on women and be a jerk!\" Then just stop and imagine how much less attractive and functional a bad attitude makes you.

This means a lot of men just aren\u2019t getting dates, since they haven\u2019t grown to better themselves to be considerate, caring, faithful partners.\n\nIn general, some women who want kids are preferring to date men who have decent jobs, a car, and are financially responsible.

They need to because it\u2019s part of their healthcare, and as defense because people use overly simplistic and at times incorrect understanding of biology as a weapon against them. Transgender people get their biology and sex. They have never argued otherwise. Transphobes made up the argument that transgender people don\u2019t accept that sex is real or what their biology is. It\u2019s an argument they made up, not trans people.\n\nSecondly a trans woman does not want to be called a biological male. Every trans person knows that\u2019s a dog whistle, and as a way to not acknowledge them by gender identity. It\u2019s simple to say someone is a trans-women. But people who are anti-trans go out of their way to call them biological males.\n\nSo the distinction is literally in saying someone is a trans-man or trans-women. And again you are arguing a non-existent argument. With that being said there might be some confusion as it relates to HRT. Hormone therapy DOES alter biology. The body receives the hormones and reacts just as it does for a cis person. A trans man will develop a deeper voice, more muscle mass, and facial hair. A trans woman will have fat redistribution to the hips and face, a loss of muscle mass, and the growth of breasts. So I\u2019m a sense the biology of a trans person is more akin to the sex they are transitioning to.

{"author":"penzos","body":"As a man I agree to an extent.  \nMen generally suck. Simply put. And their view of women in general sucks.  \nAnd I don't really see the appeal at all in them. Most of them.  \nHowever women suck as well. To the fullest. From my own experience, never did I expect a person to take care of me, or feed me, or make me food or whatnot. I always wanted an independent woman that's mature, and is satisfied with herself, so that I come to the equation as cherry on top. Like an expensive car, or a yacht. I come as luxury. And same thing for me from her. Where she comes to me as luxury. Because I'm a happy man alone already.  \nBut honestly that's never the case.  \nI can pretty much adapt to any situation. And have fun. And it's never enough really. There's always some bs. When in reality they just want to use me for whatever thing. And once they realize that I'm not what they expected or imagined or another man of interest appears, I get dealt with like a pair of socks. Integrity 0.  \nSo basically I as a satisfied man, get into a relationship, and after a couple of weeks, my life turns to drama. Start sucking super hard. Why? Because I introduced a woman to my life. And how possibly could that be the case, if that woman is so loving and caring and whatnot\n\n  \n\n\nI get judged, I'm not accepted, and there's no love really. It's just passion most of the time. And complete emotional immaturity.   \nI also accept them. And there's usually a lot of things to accept. Usually mental illness or whatnot. Pile of stupidity more often than not.  \nI was never married, but I don't really have to be to get the full picture. I know people who are. And I also know how people get married in the first place and why. And I know that they don't know themselves most of the time. Their potential as people aren't realized at all. They just do things cause everyone else does it.   \nThere's no acceptance, there's no love usually.  People are also fake most of the time. It's like a business affair in a way. Like 2 politicians making a thing work. And once they get tired of pretending, the marriage collapses.   \nBut at the same time, you don't need marriage at all. It's more like an obstacle.   \n\n\nAnd people do it for the stupidest reasons. Always money. Always some bs false sense of security. And tradition.  \nAnd the mentality behind it is usually hilarious from a standpoint of a woman.   \nBefore marriage, they want to have \"fun\". Which basically means treat men like garbage. And they usually tend to run to men who do not care for them one bit. Men who are treating them like trash. Men like that hurt them, and that somehow gives them the excuse to why they act the way they act. What they fundamentally do is just repeat the cycle. It's either a past partner or a parent trauma.  \nAnd then you get projections, and making decisions based on those projections. That's basically what it's all about.  \n\n\nI cared about all those things that you mentioned men don't care for. Always, because why else would I be there in the first place. I even offer a way for them to get better, enjoy life and so on. I'm not clingy even though I can be if needed, I give them space, but I also care at the same time. I communicate well. I forgive when they act like a piece of shit. And none of that really matters at all.  \n\n\nI always get the same crap. The only difference is the name of the woman.  \n\n\nAnd this idea that I'm supposed to do things which will \"make\" the woman happy, only showcases the stupid mentality behind the whole thing. A woman should be happy alone as is, and out of that happiness share love with someone. Instead of searching for a fix of her life in a man. Which will fundamentally lead her to a situation where she cannot be satisfied with anything no matter how hard a man tries. And will essentially make the man nothing more than a jinnee from the lamp. And a man like that can only be a henpecked person.   \n\n\n\r  \nAppreciation? What's that? Only look at features that a man has, label them as flaws, and judge.  \nAnd it's really not that hard or difficult to understand how it works. You like somebody, you meet them, and after a while you share your love with them. That's basically all there is to it. If you enjoy being with them, you stay with them.  \nBut how can you have that with people who do not have love in their hearts? They don't even love themselves, so how can they love you. You really can't. You can offer your love and that's basically it. Hope for the best. It's a gamble. And there will always be a side that's more cowardly, whether that's a man or a woman. And once the fear creeps in, the thing is pretty much over.

{"author":"Insightful_Traveler","body":"Well, there is a lot to unpack here.\n\nBased on my personal experiences, what generally occurs in long-term relationships is that communication falls by the wayside, and with that, physical intimacy becomes practically nonexistent.  Both men and women tend to neglect one another, but oftentimes in different ways.  \n\nFor example, in every single one of my long-term relationships (five in total, of about three to six years in length each), my partner holds some sort of grudge (for something that I did or entirely forgot to do), but rather than talking about it, they play the *\u201dguess why I\u2019m mad at you\u201d* game.  They then proceed to stonewall me and stop being intimately involved.  Usually this is the first sign of a breakup being inevitable, especially if there continues to be a lack of communication and physical intimacy.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, men also have their fair share of faults.  After all, we literally directly contribute to this problem where women don\u2019t feel that they should have to point out the obvious. Hence, the *\u201dguess why I\u2019m mad at you\u201d* games.  Yet this animosity generally doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nIf anything, men tend to be pretty damn easy to please.  Not to be lewd, but the wide majority of men simply desire physical intimacy itself.  Meanwhile, they often break up (or cheat) when these intimate desires are not met.  On the other hand, women tend to not be clear about what their desires are, as men should already *know* these things (much to the frustration of most men).\n\nThis is *not* to generalize.  Obviously, this doesn\u2019t apply to *all* women, or *all* men for that matter.  But based on my lived experiences, and the lived experiences of all men and women in my life, these are the situations that tend to transpire.","created_utc":1687774522000,"comment_id":"jpjhdvh","parent_id":"t3_14inkdq","score":2,"submission_id":"14inkdq"}

{"author":"Angelwatcher1711","body":"I agree with you. Men don't love women. Little boys hate little girls, and they don't change; they just learn to hide their disgust because they figure out that they need what women have...their bodies, T & A, the ability to have children, housekeeping skills (the ability to keep surroundings clean and sanitary), cooking and kitchen (this is big), a gift of gab (so the woman can carry the conversation so he doesn't have to), maybe religiosity (so he can feel religious because he has a religious wife), secretarial skills (husbands try to turn wives into their secretaries, especially if they own a business), gardening and decorating skills (sense of style, color sense, design sense), a fun personality (something to brighten up his otherwise dull existence - brought on or made worse by the horrible careers men enter (engineering (yuck), computer science (yuck), construction (even more yuck), accounting (gag me with an entire place setting), and other BORING but lucrative fields of work. Never marry an engineer - never, never, never, never, never. I did it, and I paid the price. They are so dull. They think differently - like your higher math teacher in high school or college. Their brains are trained and programmed to think like a computer, and when you think like a computer, you can't love much of anything. If they still love sex, they are doing good after years and years of having their brains twisted and tied by these horrible careers. It's seriously true. The reason men and women became so different over the centuries is because of division of labor. Women were home bearing and breastfeeding sweet, little, innocent babies and teaching them how to walk, talk, sing, dance, and create and playing with little ones all day when they weren't busy doing the wash down by the river with other women (oh for the good old days, right?) or cooking over fireplaces. As time went by, appliances replaced some of the hard work around the house, but women still have to think a whole lot about babies, children, home and hearth. Some men are coming along and pitching in now in modern times, but this is a new thing. In the 1970s, in Cincinnati where I grew up, men did not go in grocery stores. It wasn't done. If there was a man in the grocery store, all the women felt sorry for him. Either his wife was deathly ill, she left him, his mom and all the women in his life died, or something horrible happened to him to leave him in such a vulnerable situation. Women in the grocery store would start asking the man if they could help him find things. It was really unusual to see them in there. I guess men had certain places they could go to buy essentials like a corner quickstop or something, but if they needed more than that, they asked a woman to go shopping for them. That's one reason men went from mother's house to marriage so young. They had to eat, and they were not supposed to enter grocery stores. I cannot remember one time my father was in the kitchen. He didn't go in my mother's kitchen. If he wanted anything from there is was, \"Jan, get me a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (cold drink, sandwich, something to eat). I don't think it was any different at my friends' houses. I don't remember their dads in the kitchen. My aunt who is 80 still treats her husband this way. He yells out what he wants from the den, and she gets it for him. He comes to the table for meals, and maybe he does saunter out to the kitchen if she's not in there to get a beer or something, but not much. It's incredible how much things have changed in just a few decades. But anyway, men don't love women; they just need them.","created_utc":1738747360000,"comment_id":"mb10vka","parent_id":"t3_14inkdq","score":1,"submission_id":"14inkdq"}

{"author":"Andre_iTg_oof","body":"Disclaimer: I originally wrote this in a Word document and copy-pasted it here in the comments section. Why? Because I find the topic genuinely interesting, and I believe the most respectful way to engage with it is by giving fair response.\n\nI could have written much more\u2014and included far more primary sources\u2014but chose to keep it concise for now. That could be an interesting future project (especially considering how Byzantine women of power did some pretty wicked stuff!).\n\nIn any case, this is my counter-perspective on the concept of patriarchy, both in today\u2019s world and within a broader historical context.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI understand that you believe in the patriarchy. However, I want to offer you a different lens to view the world trough. \"patriarchy\"\u2014a system in which men have historically dominated power and status. It\u2019s true that, across most of recorded history, men have often occupied the highest positions in society. However, this fact alone doesn\u2019t fully capture the nuances of how power has functioned, especially when we consider the many women who have also held immense authority and influence.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of queens, empresses, who has wielded significant power in most corners of the earth. Hatshepsut, Cleopatra VII, Amina of Zazzau, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Isabella I of Castile, Maria Theresa of Austria, Wu Zetian, Empress Suiko, Rani Durgavati, Anacaona, Tomyris, Zenobia, and Shajar al-Durr prove that women not only participate in power structures. But they actively change and shape them.\n\nThis forms the groundwork of my argument. the concept of \u201cpatriarchy\u201d is flawed, not because men haven\u2019t dominated in many areas, but because it applies a binary, gendered lens to something much more complex.\n\nTake a typical monarchy: the king may be the top authority, but the queen isn\u2019t simply a powerless accessory. In many societies, a queen ranked above almost all other men. Likewise, nobility, regardless of gender, outranked the vast majority of society. So, while a man may sit at the top, this does not mean that all men are above all women. Power is not, and has never been, evenly distributed within gender categories.\n\nWhile male leadership may be the historical norm, it\u2019s not a rule without exception. And more importantly, the presence of powerful women disrupts the notion that patriarchy explains all societal power dynamics. A queen, after all, is above male peasants. A female noble may outrank a male knight. A concubine or consort may wield behind-the-scenes power far exceeding that of public officials. These are not fringe examples they\u2019re repeated across history.\n\nThat\u2019s why I argue we should move beyond viewing society through the lens of patriarchy or matriarchy. Instead, I propose using the lens of hierarchy. This framework better captures how power is distributed\u2014not by gender alone, but by class, rank, influence, and individual relationships.\n\nEven in modern contexts, this view holds. Consider the First Lady of the United States or the spouse of a prime minister. While they may not be elected officials, their proximity to power places them above the vast majority of the population\u2014men included. The same could be said for business dynasties, royal families, or high society in general.\n\nTo further support this shift in perspective, let\u2019s look at education. In Western countries, women are now outpacing men in higher education attainment. According to Eurostat, 48% of women aged 25\u201334 held tertiary degrees in 2021, compared to only 37% of men. The American Institutes for Research also notes that women earn the majority of bachelor's, master\u2019s, and increasingly, doctoral degrees. This educational advantage is not insignificant\u2014it shapes access to jobs, income, and leadership opportunities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, the belief in patriarchy is most vocal in Western societies\u2014the very societies where women have made the greatest strides in power, education, and autonomy. While inequalities certainly still exist, the \u201cpatriarchy\u201d label may obscure more than it reveals.\n\nIn summary, power structures throughout history and today are better understood through hierarchy than patriarchy. The nuance matters. Not all men are powerful. Not all women are subordinate. Power is layered, relational, and often situational\u2014and the lens of hierarchy gives us a more accurate, less binary way to understand it.\n\n(sources: [https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/eurostat\/web\/products-eurostat-news\/-\/ddn-20220524-2?utm\\_source=chatgpt.com](https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/eurostat\/web\/products-eurostat-news\/-\/ddn-20220524-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.air.org\/resource\/blog-post\/nces-forecast-degrees-increase-and-women-predominate)","created_utc":1745029208000,"comment_id":"mnstd3t","parent_id":"t3_1k1xr7t","score":3,"submission_id":"1k1xr7t"}

{"author":"Grouchy-Offer-7712","body":"Im not sure education itself is being demonized, but the system and way in which education is done.  Im pretty sure everyone but the fringe crazies believe in education...\n\nThe truth is primary education in the US has been outstripped by many many other countries in outcomes and standardized testing.  Some might ask why? \n\nLets take a look at your reasons:\n\n1.  Why is a 4 day school week worse again? There are mixed opinions on this, and i am yet to be convinced a 4 day week is rubber stamped bad. \n2.  Bit of an exaggeration.  Most people who say things like this advise NON STEM degrees are a scam.  Still an exaggeration, but the ROI from a 4 year degree in sociology is much different that one in chemical engineering.  The increased cost of college makes jobs requiring a 4 year degree with a median salary below 70k or so in the US not a good investment relative to jobs you can get without the degree, especially if you include trades and associates degrees from a community college.\n3.  Uh, this point doesnt make sense to me.  They want to ban books that contain expicit sexual content (of all kinds btw) from school libraries (not public libraries).  Noone is advocating banning them from Amazon or bookstores.  Not sure why i have to keep reminding progressives of this, I dont think its too much of a stretch for a normal person to not want an 8 year old happening upon a book like Gender Queer in the school library.  Before you flame me, if you havent read or skimmed the book, it has illustrations and descriptions of many different sex acts of all kinds that should have no place in public schools at least until high school, and even then, not sure that sex or sexual identity has a place in school except for sex education. \n4.  If youre referring to Houston ISD, that district was taken over by the state due to failing test scores.  Its one school district.  My mother is an educational consultant, and these takeovers are generally a morass of current and past mismanagement, having to find money where there is none, and tons of complaints from the community pre and post takeover.  The libraries for isd centers is a bad idea, but a national trend? I dont think so. \n5.  I live in Oklahoma (bible belt) and there is not religion in public schools.  The article you linked just talks about displaying the 10 commandments in classrooms in Louisiana.....not turning public school into sunday school...no changes to curricula.  Not a big fan of the law personally but again a huge exaggeration. \n6.  I think you are fundamentally misunderstanding the school voucher proposals.  It is enabling parents who want to go to better schools, but live in an area with terrible schools to take their tax dollars and put them with a school they approve of.  The likely result of this would be a merit based sorting of schools.  How is promoting good schools bad? Every voucher system that has been proposed has already talked about a vetting system for the schools on top of every school that exists having to be certified by the state.  What do you mean little to no oversight?\n7.  How do you know these concerned parents aren't educated? How do you know their concerns arent valid? Do you think all school boards operate perfectly with no ethical violations and perfect educational acumen? There are several \"school board meeting outbursts\" I can think of that the parent was in the right.  \n\n\nI counter all the points you made to say....I dont think anything that you listed is the root of the problem with our educational system.  I also dont have the answer.   However, there are plenty of schools with falling tests scores and none of the problems you listed.   \n\nSometimes i think we get too cute with education.  It really is just science, math, reading, and writing at the high school level and below.  Any teacher with an alternative agenda of religious evangelism or progressive education is muddying the waters.  I hope you can see through your bias enough to agree with me.  \n\nParents are also a big problem.  The world has gotten smarter and knowing basic algebra isnt enough to get you to college anymore (i am exaggerating but the point is true).  If parents arent involved and monitoring their child's education it is a problem.  COVID happened, parents were home when their kids were learning, and they didnt like what they saw.  \n\nI do not think parents taking accountability for their kids education is a bad thing. Yes if you have bad parents this stinks for you but school was not designed to replace parents and never should be.  School doesn't teach you everything.  \n\nBureaucratic bloat and corruption is an issue my mother sees a lot.  The underfunded schools dont pay their teachers well enough, and the kids suffer.  The overfunded schools (yes they exist) waste money because they have it, and if they dont spend it this year it gets removed from next years budget.  Sometimes schools push really hard to get grants they dont need as well, leading to new administrative positions that arent needed, and fancy new football stadiums that make some colleges look lime trash. \n\nJust my two cents.   \n\nTL;DR I think many people in the country are noticing falling test scores and outcomes, and the root cause has more to do with bureaucratic bloat and lack of parental involvement than anything OP said.","created_utc":1717550814000,"comment_id":"l73cufk","parent_id":"t3_1d80vv2","score":0,"submission_id":"1d80vv2"}

{"author":"HerrK_4","body":"I was recently a surrogate for a male\/male couple. I didn\u2019t enter the process out of desperation for money, I did it because I genuinely wanted to. However, after it all was said and done, I wished that I hadn\u2019t done it at all. The pregnancy was miserable. I couldn\u2019t eat for practically 9 months, the thought of food made me physically ill. Toward the end of my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with gestational hypertension. I was honestly surprised I didn\u2019t stroke out. There were moments that I thought I was going to die, both during the final weeks of pregnancy, and up to 6+ weeks after. I lost a tooth, and will soon be losing my gallbladder, because unbeknownst to me, gallstones are very common for pregnant women. I was told that the estrogen supplements I was taking for the pregnancy to stick only INCREASED my chances. When I brought this up to my intended parents, they mentioned what the contract stated, and not that they were willing to take care of costs since it was an outcome of the pregnancy. It was funny (but not really), because I had mentioned to my wife, and I quote \u201cwatch this land solely on me, because they\u2019ve already have what they wanted. They don\u2019t give a sh*t about my health anymore.\u201d and it really seems like that may be the case, since they brought up the contract. There are too many unknowns when it comes to surrogacy. If you\u2019re a gestational carrier, it\u2019s a completely unnatural process for your body, which I feel puts you at increased risk for health complications. I know my doctor said it only took a few weeks for the hormones to leave my body, but I feel like that\u2019s complete bullshit. I feel like the hormonal supplements are going to cause many issues for me in the future. I\u2019m happy that I was able to give someone a child, that they couldn\u2019t have had otherwise, but I regret that I ever did it, because it seems like once you\u2019re done being \u201crented\u201d (as I\u2019ve heard others call it) it feels like you\u2019re no longer cared about.

We have a pool at our house, so the girls are welcome anytime, they wear what I consider to be appropriate suits, even the 17 y\/o. The problem is that we let them invite friends, one girl in particular, her dad is a professional athlete, she is 15 and has the body of a woman.\n\nWe always have an adult out to supervise, that is 90% me, my wife is sun sensitive. The girl I was speaking about, her dad drops her off, we chat sports for a minute, the girl has a coverup on, I said I better get back to the pool. When this child takes off her coverup, she was virtually naked. she had on a 2 piece, the bottom had hi rise legs, he butt completely uncovered by the thong, the top not much better, I was embarrassed. I asked my wife to come out. I asked her how do we handle this, I think it made the other girls uneasy too.\n\nI drove the girls home, I called 1st and asked the dad if I could speak to him, he invited me in for an ice tea. I just laid it out, that his daughter's swimwear should be appropriate if she wants to be invited again. He got this quizzical look on his face and called his daughter to the room, she still had her coverup on, he asked her to take it off, his words were \"Jesus Christ, where did you get that\", she said Mom bought it for her.\n\nI left it at that, the next time she came over she had on an appropriate olympic tank suit. My granddaughter told me her mom is weird, she showed me the girls instagram page of the clothes her mom bought for her. Mom may have been a stripper of something like that.","created_utc":1626225955000,"comment_id":"h5246hu","parent_id":"t3_ojjilt","score":2,"submission_id":"ojjilt"}

However, instead of raising the fucking floor for everyone, you (society) decided imposing ceilings above GenZ men. \n\nPartially, the issue has nothing to do with the gender disparity and somewhat is caused by the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

{"author":"intellectualgulf","body":"You\u2019re not technically wrong, but I\u2019m going to hypothesize that you don\u2019t realize the nuances of the discussion in the USA. \n\nIs racism any kind of discrimination based on a person\u2019s actual or apparent racial lineage?\n\nYeah. \n\nIs there a very complex and nuanced incarnation of racism present in the USA, and does every country have its own version? \n\nAbsolutely yes. \n\nSee the USA isn\u2019t the only country, but we are one of the major countries that has incredibly harmful incarnations of racist ideals present in their governmental, judicial, and societal aspects to this very day. \n\nFor example voter ID laws and suppression of minority voting is still very prevalent, and up until the 1960\u2019s there were still \u201csunset towns\u201d where it literally became illegal to be anything other than white within town limits after sunset. \n\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sundown_town\n\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States\n\nSomeone from that era could have been 18 and would only be 62 today, very much still voting assuming they haven\u2019t been denied their right as citizens by pearl clutching conservatives. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that racism is absolutely any form of discrimination against an individual based on their actual or apparent racial background, but that in the context of the United States in the past 80 years anything other than \u201cwhite non Hispanic\u201d has been exceptionally prejudiced against. \n\nWhen people say \u201conly white people are racist\u201d in the context of the USA, what they mean is that white people have predominantly held power, influence, and governmental \/ judicial control of the country while purposefully preventing and actively harming any attempts at progress for minorities. \n\nMinority racism isn\u2019t evaluated \u201cas seriously\u201d for the same reason a 5 year old punching an adult isn\u2019t seen as seriously as an adult punching a child. \n\nMost non white persons belong to a historically minority (social \/ judicial \/ governmental influence) group with limited to no ability to actually cause harm (outside of direct physical violence) against their oppressors. \n\nThey are \u201cpunching up\u201d in the same way a child must punch up to hit an adult, with very little societal or governmental weight to support their efforts. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t excuse murder or any criminal behavior actually harmful to society in any way, it\u2019s just a necessary background to understand the nuances to the perception of racism in modern USA.","created_utc":1643713842000,"comment_id":"hv32761","parent_id":"t3_shf44u","score":2,"submission_id":"shf44u"}
