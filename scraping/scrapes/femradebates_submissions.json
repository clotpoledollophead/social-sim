The sexualization of men of color. As a black man, when I confessed I liked my first love and asked her out she told me she didn't like boys with \"small dicks\" and that she only liked guys with big dicks. I was 14 years old and told out the gate that my worth was only through my penis size. I wasn't even small either.\n\nFew years later? Had my cock grabbed by a girl to confirm to her girls my penis size. She just got away with it. Did I tell anyone? Fuck no.\n\nAs a black man I am consistently fetishized, even by women of my own race. To be a \"real\" black man, you must be alpha of the most alpha. You must be tall as a basketball player, have endless swag, and an 8 inch dick. People constantly sexualize black men and assume we are freaks in the sack as if that's our only worth.\n\nAnd that's without the assumption that we are inherently criminals.\n\nImagine being a black boy and growing up in that environment and realizing at an early age that your worth is what is between your pants. Imagine being an Asian boy and having a lifetime of dehumanization and emasculating behavior on the assumption - I'll reemphasize, assumption - that you have a small penis and therefore have little worth.\n\nBut according to feminism we have male privilege and are inherently oppressors.\n\nWatch this interview with Big Red: \n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/fHppdGqHtrU\n\nWould anything she's saying about men apply to black men or other non-white men?\n\nWhile I acknowledge that there are some feminists tackling the topic of race, most notably intersectional feminists, is still feels like a massive blind spot. Intersectional feminists regularly argue race issues from women's standpoint. I realize there are some feminists that argue this is a patriarchal issue and they seem to argue it in good faith that men are just as much victims of patriarchy as women are, but I'm not seeing it. I expressed these feelings to a female feminist friend and she said it's just patriarchy and men being placed in boxes. She names the problem but gives zero solutions. She blames patriarchy but it's *women* that told me not to cry at my own fathers funeral and that I had to stay strong \"for everyone else\". It was *women* that said my worth was in my penis. It was *women* that judge me because I'm less than 6 foot tall. And yet it's men that are the most understanding of my concerns and issues and I'm seen as a bad person when I say I'm not a feminist. My friend stated that women uphold patriarchy just as much as men, but isn't that a little convenient? I feel like these big sweeping things like patriarchy are only held in place arguments to keep women from accepting responsibility for their actions. \"Yes you were abuse and assaulted but really it was the *patriarchy* and therefore **men** who you should actually blame.\" Why would any man want to sign up for that? Please humor me.\n\nI saw this TED lecture of a woman's issue and I like this feminism, but it still blames an unseen force, the patriarchy, as the real reason for men's suffering. Video found here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/l1qZCTmsEv4\n\nI understand that intersectional feminism is very much a thing that tries to tackle the web that affects gender, but in my experience, even with those acknowledgements they still lambast men. It's very common on social media for women to make posts like,\"guys will do ___ and ____ rather than go to therapy\". Why don't you help form a campaign that champions the idea of therapy for men using that same platform? Even when under the guise of empathy men are still shamed and mocked. \n\nI don't identify as an MRA, but I get it. Feminists also bring up good points. Women absolutely deserve empowerment, women deserve to be supported and not slut shamed when they are raped. I understand that many, *many*, **many** men still view women as objects. But I'm not seeing any feminists fight for anything that makes things equal while claiming they are. It very much feels like a women's specific issue. I wish there were a bigger Egalitarian movement that fights both issues facing both sexes. I think many of our goals are aligned and I'm not convinced as to how modern feminism has any actual solutions for the problems that face men. \n\nThe main pox of the modern feminist movement is claims that women are the ultimate victims when they are just as likely to be perpetrators. You are not the only one sexualized and you are not the only victims.","title":"just watched The Red Pill Documentary and it revealed to me that feminists arguments have massive blind spots as they seemingly only focus on white men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/nau9zw\/just_watched_the_red_pill_documentary_and_it\/","upvote_ratio":0.97,"over_18":false}

But the reason I mention this is because I think that society hasn't realized that maybe men need to hear this as well.\n\nA lot of men are still trapped by old gender roles and a lot of young men in particular base their self worth, and masculinity, on their interactions with women. Primarily in terms of how many dates they can get and how many women they can bed. The negative consequences of men being stuck in these gender roles, and unable to fulfill them, can end up being both detrimental to those men's self esteem and society at large (see incels).\n\nI'm not advocating for MGTOW or necessarily anything that extreme, but i think modern men should be taught how to lead a life that doesn't necessarily involve or revolve around women.

This is a common myth.\n\nBeing *allowed* \u2013 not *forced* \u2013 to stay at home is a privilege. Historically, only some women had that privilege. Men were *forced* \u2013 not *allowed* \u2013 to go to work to support women.\n\nThe difference between being *allowed* to do something and being *forced* is important. It\u2019s the difference between employment and slavery. Between sex and rape. Between imprisonment and accommodation. This is why feminists always frame men being forced to do something as men being \u2018allowed\u2019 to. eg the draft \u2013 men being forced to fight \u2013 is cast as men being \u2018allowed\u2019 to fight. Gender roles \u2013 men being forced to support women under threat of imprisonment \u2013 are phrased as men being \u2018allowed\u2019 to work. This is as ridiculous as a man claiming female rape victims are privileged because they are \u201callowed to have sex.\u201d Or slaves are privileged because they are \u201callowed to work.\u201d Or conscripted men are privileged because they are \u201callowed to fight.\u201d\n\nSome people believe men historically (and present) were not forced to work and that women were not \u2018allowed\u2019 to work, but this is incorrect so let's run down the facts.\n\n**Fact #1: Most men prefer staying at home**\n\nA [survey](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140712161707\/http:\/\/www.about-monster.com\/content\/monster-survey-finds-more-fathers-seek-success-both-office-and-home) done in 2007 found that 68% percent of fathers would be a stay-at-home parent if money were no object. Another [survey](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2013\/12\/11\/chapter-5-balancing-work-and-family\/) done by the Pew Research Center found that 87% of men who did quit their job after having a child to stay at home say they are glad they did. Warren Farrell reported in \u201cThe Myth of Male Power\u201d that 80% of men he surveyed said that if they could stay at home with no loss of income and their wives approval, they would. Only 3% said they would prefer to work full-time.\n\n**Fact #2: Most women do not want to work outside the home**\n\nA [survey](http:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/2007\/07\/12\/fewer-mothers-prefer-full-time-work\/) done by the Pew Research Center found that among women at home with children less than 18, only 16% (less than one in six) say they want to work outside the home full-time. That [drops](http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2013\/08\/19\/mothers-and-work-whats-ideal\/) to 12% if the children are young. For women with children who do work full-time outside the home, more than half want to change to working part-time or not working at all, according to yet another [survey](http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2013\/08\/19\/mothers-and-work-whats-ideal\/) done by the Pew Research Center.\n\nWomen are 38% [more](http:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/2013\/12\/11\/chapter-5-balancing-work-and-family\/) [likely](https:\/\/sci-hub.tw\/http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0192513x10370108) to file for divorce if she works more than her husband than vice versa, and 29% more likely to divorce if they have had to increase the number of hours worked outside the home in the last 5 years. As The Atlantic [reported](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2013\/12\/moms-who-cut-back-at-work-are-happier\/282460\/):\n\n>Two facts are often obscured in the public conversation devoted to women, work, and family. First, the vast majority of married mothers don\u2019t want to work full-time. Second, married mothers who are able to cut back at work to accommodate their family\u2019s needs tend to be happier. The news cycle is stuck in a lean-in loop, but new data show mothers report more happiness when they can lean homeward.\n\nIn a 1985 Roper [survey](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/1986\/09\/women-in-the-work-force\/304924\/), only 10 percent of women declared that a husband should turn down a very good job in another city \u201cso the wife can continue her job.\"\n\nAn [overview](http:\/\/www.lse.ac.uk\/website-archive\/newsAndMedia\/newsArchives\/2010\/08\/CatherineHakimRenewal.pdf) of multiple studies across Europe concluded that only 14%-20% of women aged 16+ are \u201cwork-centered\u201d which it defines as \u201cCommitted to work or equivalent activities\u201d. The author concludes:\n\n>\u201cFeminists constantly complain that men are not doing their fair share of domestic work. The reality is that most men already do more than their fair share.\u201d and \u201cAs factual data replaces received wisdom, several well-entrenched feminist myths have been overturned \u2026 Men do substantially more hours of paid work.\u201d\n\n**Fact #3: Historically, women were allowed to work outside the home.**\n\nIn early agricultural societies, women [worked](http:\/\/www.cam.ac.uk\/research\/news\/prehistoric-womens-manual-work-was-tougher-than-rowing-in-todays-elite-boat-crews) by grinding grain for as much as 5 hours a day to make flour, in addition to tilling soil and harvesting crops by hand. This has [been](https:\/\/www.routledge.com\/A-History-of-European-Womens-Work-1700-to-the-Present\/Simonton\/p\/book\/9780415055321) [confirmed](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Becoming-Visible-Women-European-History\/dp\/0395796253) by studies of Ancient Egypt which show that almost all non-aristocratic women worked, including spinning, combing, and carding cloth.\n\nFrom the 13th to the 17th Century, most brewers were women. A [survey](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ale-Beer-Brewsters-England-Changing\/dp\/0195126505) in 1228 found 80% of brewers in towns were female. A [study](https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/C5D42E9BA2C056B5BF2CD074A26A2D8A\/S0020859000114786a.pdf\/origins_and_expansion_of_the_male_breadwinner_family_the_case_of_nineteenthcentury_britain.pdf) of 1,350 working-class households from early 19th Century Britain suggests that the husbands\u2019 proportion of family earning was as low as 55 percent.\n\nBetween 1787 to 1815 in families with unemployed children, wives [earned](https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/international-review-of-social-history\/article\/origins-and-expansion-of-the-male-breadwinner-family-the-case-of-nineteenthcentury-britain\/C5D42E9BA2C056B5BF2CD074A26A2D8A) 41 percent of household income. In this same period, 66% of married women had a [recorded](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/2597872?seq=1) occupation. In 1833 Britain, [women](https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/Report_from_Dr_James_Mitchell_to_the_Cen\/1jp_YgEACAAJ?hl=en) [made](http:\/\/eh.net\/encyclopedia\/women-workers-in-the-british-industrial-revolution\/) up 57% \u2013 the majority \u2013 of factory workers. Even in labor-intensive agricultural work, significant numbers of women [worked](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/2566496?seq=1).\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/MFGBrg2](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/MFGBrg2)\n\nHowever, by 1851 the proportion of married women who worked had [dropped](http:\/\/eh.net\/encyclopedia\/women-workers-in-the-british-industrial-revolution\/) to 30%. The share of household income generated by women started to [decline](https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/international-review-of-social-history\/article\/origins-and-expansion-of-the-male-breadwinner-family-the-case-of-nineteenthcentury-britain\/C5D42E9BA2C056B5BF2CD074A26A2D8A) [rapidly](https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/S0020859000114786) from around 1830 onwards. Notably, this involved \u201cincreased leisure for women and children\u201d with the percentage of income generated by men increasing from 55% in 1831-1855 up to 81% in 1860-1865.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/1o4NdJK](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/1o4NdJK)\n\nBy 1890, women\u2019s work in Europe and the United States contributed just 1.9 percent to 3 percent of household [income](https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/The-Life-Cycle%2C-Savings%2C-and-Demographic-Some-for-Haines\/cf9b3e594a01e5842c77553a6115bb8de9cf1842). This was entirely because of married women being supported by their husbands. By 1887, 3\/4 of female workers in American cities were under 25 years old. 96% of them were single.\n\nBy 1911 only 25% of British women [worked](https:\/\/www.meta-katalog.eu\/Record\/4796fmt\/HierarchyTree?recordID=4796fmt). In 1920 in the US, women were only 21% of [employed](https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/wb\/info_about_wb\/interwb.htm) adults.\n\nWe can speculate this was because the extra wealth from industrialization meant it became possible for some people to not work outside the home, and women got this benefit. This is supported by the fact that the total working hours have [dropped](https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2018\/05\/working-hours) by almost half since 1870.\n\nThis change from the vast majority of women working (pre-1850s) to a small percentage (by 1920s) was overwhelmingly welcomed by women, and universally seen as a benefit to women.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill thought that \u201cit is not\u2026 a desirable custom that the wife should contribute by her labor to the income of the family.\u201d\n\nThe German Government stated in 1940: \u201cthe goal remains to ensure that, in 20 years\u2019 time, no woman is obliged to work in a factory.\u201d\n\nIn the Soviet Union, when mothers got permission to work part-time instead of full time, and fathers still had to work full-time, this was welcomed as \u201cliberating\u201d by women\u2019s [groups](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/106591299304600113).\n\nEven as late as 1915 women\u2019s rights campaigner Clementina Black was [complaining](https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/cu31924002665739\/cu31924002665739_djvu.txt) about the fact that married women, as well as single women, had to work to earn money.\n\nDuring WWII, when many women had to do war work in factories, it was found that women had been \u201cmade miserable by the \\[war work\\]\u201d and \u201cfervently wished themselves back into their prewar home routine.\u201d\n\nDuring the war, there were many efforts to get women to enter the workforce, but very few did meaning that they were given the choice.\n\nMen, however, [were not](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bevin_Boys).\n\n**Fact #4: Historically, men were forced to work outside the home**\n\nAs early as 92 BC men were forced to support their wives by law.\n\nMen who refused to support their wives were legally punished under Roman law.\n\nUnder the common law of \u2018coverture\u2019, which existed in England from at least 1660 to the 19th century, and in America until 1839 \u201cA wife was entitled to be maintained by her husband\u201d \u2013 if she got into any debts, the husband had to pay them. If he refused, he could be imprisoned in debtors' prison. Wives could not be sued or imprisoned for debt.\n\nIt\u2019s because of this that 18th-century [texts](http:\/\/www.academia.edu\/746242\/Favoured_or_oppressed_Married_women_property_and_coverturein_England_1660_1800) said that a married Woman \u2018is a Favourite of the Law\u2019 and described England as \u2018the Paradise of women.'\n\nCoverture was only legally abolished by the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of 1882 (in the UK). Men were responsible for paying women\u2019s income tax for much longer, and this was exploited by suffragettes to send their husbands to jail simply by her refusing to pay tax.\n\nAn article from 1912 [notes](https:\/\/news.google.com\/newspapers?id=5JQWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7CAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6049,712919&dq):\n\n>Under the married women property act a husband has no jurisdiction over his wife\u2019s property and income. Under the income tax he is responsible for her taxes. If the taxes are not paid, the husband, not the wife, is imprisoned. Mrs. Wilks refused to pay her income tax \u2013 $185 \u2013 and her husband was locked up. He will spend the rest of his life in prison unless his wife pays or the law is changed.\n\nIn 1660, a Venetian noblewoman [wrote](https:\/\/gynocentrism.com\/2013\/09\/12\/lucrezia-marinella-gynocentrism-in-the-16th-century\/):\n\n>It is a marvelous sight in our city to see the wife of a shoemaker or butcher or even a porter all dressed up with gold chains round her neck, with pearls and valuable rings on her fingers, accompanied by a pair of women on either side to assist her and give her a hand, and then, by contrast, to see her husband cutting up meat all soiled with ox\u2019s blood and down at heel, or loaded up like a beast of burden dressed in rough cloth, as porters are\u2026. In France men may not spend even a centime unless at the request of their wives, and women not only administrate business dealings and sales but private income as well.\n\nIn the 19th Century, women could sue their husbands for maintenance while still married, and if she won the man could be imprisoned.\n\nEven after the English common law of \u2018coverture\u2019 was replaced, men were legally obliged to support their wives. This was reinforced in successive acts of parliament in 1861, 1881, 1920, and 1964.\n\nEven after the official end of coverture in Britain with the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of 1882 husbands\u2019 were liable for debts their wives had from before they were married. Men could, and were, [imprisoned](http:\/\/www.legislation.gov.uk\/ukpga\/Vict\/45-46\/75\/enacted) for not paying their wives' debts.\n\nThis obligation to support his wife stayed in force even if the couple lived apart, even if she had abandoned him and with no obligation on her (note divorces were extremely difficult to obtain in this period).\n\nAround 1901, this newspaper published this heartfelt letter from 37 husbands jailed for non-support, begging their wives to let them out just for the upcoming holiday:\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/URIuwLx](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/URIuwLx)\n\nUnder [Sharia (Islamic) law](http:\/\/syaria.com\/568-on-using-wifes-salary.html) a man must support his wife: \u201cAllah has ordained men to earn the living of his wife and children\u201d\n\n\u201cA husband is obliged to earn the living for his wife and fulfill all her needs although his wife is a rich woman. The riches of a wife doesn\u2019t nullify her right, which is the obligation of her husband.\u201d But any money a married woman earns is her own and she has no obligation to spend it to support her husband or children.\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Ireland (written in 1937) explicitly states women \u2013 and only women \u2013 shall not be obliged to work:\n\n>...the State shall, therefore, endeavour to insure mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour\n\nSimilarly, in the U.S, the law is highly [gendered](https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/230140287.pdf), with the United States Supreme Court striking down an Alabama law that denied alimony to a person simply because he is male.\n\nAnd as of now, only about 3% of alimony recipients of men, and campaigners admit alimony laws are only now being reformed due to the fact that now some women are having to pay.\n\n**Fact #5: Men have historically worked much harder labor than women**\n\nEven from an etymological perspective, the Biblical term eved, \u201cslave,\u201d only has a male form. The terms for \u201cfemale slave,\u201d shifcha and ama, are related to the Semitic words for \u201cfemale\u201d and \u201cfamily.\u201c \u201cThis reflects the fact that female slaves often served as concubines. Clearly, neither term connotes anything to do with labor. Similarly, in Germanic languages, Arbeiter (laborer) was originally male and only acquired its female form after 1800. A second word, schaffen, is said to be derived from the Old German scaffan, \u201cbent double.\u201d \u201cIn addition to its primary meaning of \u201cto create,\u201d it also means \u201cto succeed by hard work,\u201d \u201cto toil,\u201d or \u201cto slog.\u201d The derivative term for \u201cworker,\u201d Schaffer, is male and often used as a surname. As such, it has no female equivalent.\u201d\n\nReality reflects these etymological roots throughout history. In ancient [Egypt](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Slavery-Ancient-Near-East-Comparative\/dp\/0313204993), the 100,000 people conscripted each year to build the pyramids who, as pictures show, were soundly whipped when they did not pull their weight were not women, but men. Men, whether prisoners of war or those enlisted by press-gangs, constructed roads, dug canals, erected fortresses, and built temples all over the ancient Middle East.\n\nAccording to the Bible, King Solomon used tens of thousands of male slaves to obtain the materials for building the Lord\u2019s Temple. Men, not women, built the Great Wall of China, dying by the thousands in the process. Countless male slaves, but very few female ones, worked in the silver mines of Laurion from which classical Athens derived much of its wealth.\n\nMen, not women, sometimes took the place of beasts of burden in turning industrial-scale mills where corn was ground. Much like modern prisons, the places where such work was done were normally considered too unsavory to attract visits by members of polite society. During the second century A.D, however, one of them was inspected by the Roman writer Apuleius, who reported that:\n\n>Merciful gods, what wretched manikins did I see there, their entire skin covered with bluish welts, their backs torn into bloody strips, barely covered with rags, some having only their genitals covered with a piece of cloth, all of them showing everything through their tatters. Their foreheads were branded with letters, their heads half shorn, their feet stuck in rings. They were hideously pale, the dank of the stinking hole had consumed their eyelashes and diminished their sight. Like wrestlers, who are sprinkled with a fine powder as they fight their bouts, they were blanched with a layer of dirty-white flour.\n\nBeing a female slave, to be sure, was hardly all fun and games, both because of the nature of their labor and because they were sexually at the mercy of their owners. However, a scrawny prostitute, or one dressed in tatters, or one too frightened to properly play her role, would have commanded a much lower price, if any. Hence workers in the oldest profession are usually well fed, reasonably clothed and tolerably housed. They are also unlikely to undergo physical punishment so severe as to permanently damage their charms. In any case, as references in Petronius, Horace and Seneca show, male slaves were also open to sexual exploitation.\n\nSource: Petronius, Satyricon, 75.11; Horace, Satires, 1.2.116-19; Seneca, Controversies, IB praef. 1. See also Beert C. Verstraete, \"Slavery and the Social Dynamics of Male Homosexual Relations in Ancient Rome,\" Journal of Homosexuality, 5, 3, spring 1980, pp. 227-36.\n\nIn 19th-century America, it was cowboys, not cowgirls, who spent weeks on the trail, sleeping in the open air, unable to wash, shave or change clothes, while driving cattle from grazing ground to market and from market to railhead. In other societies, too, the less pleasant, the more demanding and the more dangerous a job, the more likely it was to be done by men.\n\nEtc. etc.\n\nAll of this has and still leads to women having:\n\n* A better work-life balance,\n* higher reported levels of life satisfaction,\n* higher reported levels of happiness,\n* more free time,\n* more time spent at home,\n* better health outcomes,\n* lower mortality rates,\n* and a longer life.\n\nThough it is a long and persisting myth that women were confined to the domestic sphere and that men got to work jobs which is a privilege, this is discounted by all the relevant data.\n\nThanks for reading!","title":"Being stay-at-home is a privilege","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/m919hq\/being_stayathome_is_a_privilege\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

I am pursuing a career in academia. I'd prefer not to go too much into detail as I value my privacy. But I have spent ample time throughout the institution I both attend and work for in multiple roles. \n\nMy journey to where I find myself today started a few weeks before the creation of this account. A few close male peers of mine opened up to me about their experiences of sexism at the hands of a few members of one a feminist students advocacy group. At first I did not believe them as I believed that sexism in any form was a direct opposition to egalitarian values. And being that they had pointed towards a group that had defined themselves by those values as the culprit I felt that there must be more to the story. \n\nSo I asked around. And I found that the members of this group that had been sexist towards my male peers openly admitted to it. Citing my male peers making \"MRA Arguments\" I then through further digging found that these \"MRA arguments\" had to do with domestic abuse and a lack of resources for male victims. \n\nSomething my own later research found to be a legitimate issue. Which raised the question as to why my peers were dismissed and body shamed for bringing it up. I had heard of MRA's before but I never really looked into them. So I decided to do some digging. For a while I lurked around in MRA and feminist forums. And then I decided to pull the proverbial trigger and join in on a few forums like this one that brought the two groups together in discussion. \n\nthough I was certainly aiming to change my mind with new information. I did not expect things to be so abrupt. I was given warm (though often skeptical or distrusting) welcomes from the MRA's I interacted with. While the feminists I interacted with were often rather harsh. I often felt as though I was brushed off for simply not \"knowing enough\" to agree with them outright. Often my questions or critiques were met with accusations of misogyny or malicious intent. Though to be fair both sides were consistently skeptical of malicious intent. I later learned of just how common it is to have one's words twisted. So I understand at some level the skepticism. \n\nBut one underlying issue truly \"caught\" me. And that is the logic and rhetoric used by either side. \n\nOn the feminist side there are decades of academic roots that are deeply entrenched. And while this is undoubtedly a good foundation. I also found that there are many egregious cracks in said foundation. There are a number of well documented but rarely spoken of fallacies throughout this area of academia. From ad hoc rationalizations to confirmation bias to unfalsifiable theories. To quote one MRA I found online \n\n>Feminist theory defines patriarchy as an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women.%5B32%5D It often includes any social mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.%5B33%5D\n\n\n>So Patriarchy is oppressive to both men and women? But if so then the definition seems relatively gender neutral while the term Patriarchy is not gender neutral. So if our society is oppressive to both men and women then couldn't you just as easily describe our society as a Matriarchy? The equivalent definition for Matriarchy would be:\n\n>An unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women.%5B32%5D It often includes any social mechanism that evokes female dominance over men.\n\n\n>So we just need 1 case of a social mechanism that evokes female dominance over men to satisfy the definition of Matriarchy? Well one example would be the social expectation where males pay for dates. So the definition of Matriarchy is satisfied so we must live in a Matriarchy.\n\n>But if the definitions of both Patriarchy and Matriarchy are satisfied, then do we live in both a Matriarchy and a Patriarchy at the same time? Why should we describe our society as a Patriarchy rather than a Matriarchy? And if the definitions are relatively gender neutral, then why not use a gender neutral term like Traditionalism instead?\n\n>To this I turn to the scientific philosopher Karl Popper. In science a theory is called falsifiable if it is possible to conceive an observation or an argument which proves the statement in question to be false. In this sense, falsify is synonymous with nullify, meaning not \"to commit fraud\" but \"show to be false\". Some philosophers argue that science must be falsifiable.\n\n>Falsifiability is very important in science because it means you can test predictions and either verify or falsify a theory to obtain a better understanding of reality. Without falsifiability, how can we exclude absurd hypothesis from our set of scientific beliefs such as the idea that a giant flying spaghetti monster created everything? Is the feminist theory of patriarchy falsifiable? What testable predictions does it make that cannot also be explained by Matriarchy?\n\nThis is just one example of the issues I started to find. This is not to say that there aren't issues on the MRA side. But largely those issues are a lack of presence and roots in academia. The MRM is largely not rooted in academia like feminists so they don\u2019t have the same strict academic discipline in their language and models, which makes it easy to mock and shoot down. Picture a 40 year old feminist with a lifetime of training in academia and research and activism cutting down young boys and men with legitimate and unaddressed issues and trauma's. Yet the former group feels as though they are punching up but as they now populate highest offices media and academia, they are in fact punching down.\n\nWhat I also found was that where there WAS academic backing to MRA ideas. It often stood up well to criticism and did a better job of explaining issues on a grander scale than I felt feminist explanations did. And then comes the pole that pushed me off the proverbial plank. \n\nDogmatism, Bias and an unwillingness to consider alternative ideas. \n\nthis may be relying too much on proverbs. But this truly was the final nail in the coffin for me. Many of the feminists I spoke with online had an underlying issue wherein any critique of feminism was treated as an attack on women. Yet there are numerous sly and somewhat underhanded terms, beliefs and theories I encountered about men that are outright misandrist. Yet consistently whenever this was pointed out by anybody (myself included) we were dismissed as simply \"not understanding\" The terms \"motte and bailey\" and \"dog whistle\" both come to mind though I don't have the words to adequately pinpoint what I saw. It was simply often the case that things that reflected negatively on men were to be taken in the most generous way while anything that may reflect negatively on women was to be taken in the least generous way. for example. \"Kill all men\" is only ever a joke and nobody should ever feel insulted or hurt by it. But \"don't be a pussy\" is a grave insult against women that demeans femininity by treating female genitalia as something undesirable. \n\nThis is clearly the result of numerous in group biases and outright tribalism. And then even when presented with better alternatives or solid arguments as to why either beliefs were correct or harmful. The result was often a push to either silence the people offering them or the one being offered these things would leave the conversation. The appearance was thoroughly such that ones mind could not and would not be changed regardless of evidence to the contrary. \n\nI as a person value academic and intellectual integrity. I value solid rationale and being able to adapt to new information. And in the last year of involving myself with feminists and MRA's. I have found that the MRA's consistently offered these things where it was common that feminists did not if not taking the opposite approach. I accept that there are exceptions to both of these. and that this is simply my own anecdotal experience. But it has been enough to personally sway me in such a way that I no longer identify as a feminist","title":"I am a woman. I have marched in feminist protests.

She also admitted that Doe had asked her to leave multiple times during the encounter...Smith submitted text messages with Doe and with her friends, which confirmed that she knew Doe was \"super blacked\" [severely drunk] at the time.\n\nSo arguably, he was expelled for being sexually assaulted. Literally punished for being taken advantage of while severely mentally and likely physically impaired\n\n>Smith made explicitly clear that the sexual encounter had been consensual (ignoring Doe\u2019s intoxication), and that her complaint was limited to the bruises she received from the sadomasochistic activities...Smith told Sheahan that she had \"engaged in sexual acts\" with Doe and \"instigated a wrestling match\" with him. She stated that she was \"on top of John Doe during their entire encounter\" and that Doe\u2019s participation was due to his state of intoxication. Despite these admissions, she insisted that \"this is not a nonconsensual sex case.\"\n\nNotice that the whole time, the only person's who's consent is considered is the woman's. The only question asked is \"did he rape her or did he not rape her?\", and the possibility or her raping him is not even considered despite that that seems to be more or less what happened.

This is illustrated by the \"Power and Control Wheel,\" a graphic typically displayed as a poster in participating locations.[5][6] According to the Duluth Model, \"women and children are vulnerable to violence because of their unequal social, economic, and political status in society.\"[7] Treatment of abusive men is focused on re-education, as \"we do not see men\u2019s violence against women as stemming from individual pathology, but rather from a socially reinforced sense of entitlement.\"\n\n\nBUT. Even the creator of the program.  Ellen Pence herself has written,\n\n>\"By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff [...] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with [...] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find.\"[20]\n\nAnd In 2011 a study was published on The Helpseeking Experiences of Men Who Sustain Intimate Partner Violence\n\nYou can read the full thing here. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3175099\/\n\nFor the sake of brevity I will only be quoting two chunks of text.\n\n>When calling domestic violence hotlines, for instance, men who sustained all types of IPV report that the hotline workers say that they only help women, infer or explicitly state that the men must be the actual instigators of the violence, or ridicule them. Male helpseekers also report that hotlines will sometimes refer them to batterers\u2019 programs. Some men have reported that when they call the police during an incident in which their female partners are violent, the police sometimes fail to respond. Other men reported being ridiculed by the police or being incorrectly arrested as the primary aggressor. Within the judicial system, some men who sustained IPV reported experiencing gender-stereotyped treatment. Even with apparent corroborating evidence that their female partners were violent and that the helpseekers were not, they reportedly lost custody of their children, were blocked from seeing their children, and were falsely accused by their partners of IPV and abusing their children. According to some, the burden of proof for male IPV victims may be especially high\n\nAnd.\n\n>Family and friends were overwhelmingly reported as being the most helpful resource, and mental health and medical professionals were rated as being among the most helpful of the formal resources. These professionals were reported to have taken the male victims seriously and to inquire about the origin of the men\u2019s injuries. The resources providing the least support to men seeking help for IPV victimization are those that are the core of the DV service system: DV agencies, DV hotlines, and the police. On the one hand, about 25% of men who sought help from DV hotlines were connected with resources that were helpful. On the other hand, nearly 67% of men reported that these DV agencies and hotline were not at all helpful. Many reported being turned away.\n\nWhen the most used domestic violence program in the U.S postulates that men are perpetrators who are violent because they have been socialized in a patriarchy that condones male violence, and that women are victims who are violent only in self-defense.\n \nit creates institutional discrimination against men who simply aren't patriarchal oppressors. \n\nThis is what happens when you treat men as the enemy.","title":"The duluth model is a prime example of how feminist theory has institutionalized misandry.

Particularly, the sub has a post titled \"Fact Checking False   Rape Accusations and Why We Shouldn't Fear a False Rape Epidemic.\" and   it perpetuates very dangerous ways of thinking about these numbers and   accusations in general.\n\nThe   headline is, absolutely no one has any idea how many accusations of rape   are false, and every statistic you have ever read about what  percentage  are false is based on how many are ***proven*** false *after being reported to authorities.*   It is very important to understand this distinction, as it is   incredibly harmful and dangerous to say something careless like \"2 to   10% of accusations are false\" because the unspoken corollary is \"90 to   98% are true\" which is unfounded, and encourages people to assume   accusations are true without evidence.\n\nHow Many False Rape Accusations Are There?\n\nNo   one knows, or even has the foggiest idea. I'm going to address why  that  is and why the statistics that get passed around cannot be used to   determine this. The sub's post about this states the following:\n\n>Most experts agree that false rape accusations make the total of 2-10% of the total accusations of rape.\n\nIn   Lisak et al. (2010) they performed a review on 136 accusations made   over 10 years to a university in Boston. These were the percentages for   each category:\n\n**False report**: 5.9%\n\n**Case did not proceed:** 44.9%\n\n**Case proceeded:** 35.3\n\n**Insufficient information:** 13.9%\n\nOnly   35.3% of cases had enough evidence for the university police  department  to take disciplinary action. Their conclusion in the  research was that  with a false report rate of 5.9%, it can be estimated  that roughly **2 to 10% of accusations are false.**   However, would we accept that same reasoning for true accusations?  That  with a positive case rate of 35.3 percent, it can be estimated  that **20 to 40% of accusations are true**?\n\nNo,   I don't think anyone would accept that, and we should apply no such   double standard to false accusations. Every single statistic that has   ever been made for this follows the exact same error of reasoning.\n\n>Using   qualitative and quantitative analysis, researchers studied 812 reports   of sexual assault from 2000-2003 and found a 2.1% of false reports   (Heenan & Murray 2006).\n\n**False report**: 2.1%\n\n**Case did not proceed**: 46.4%\n\n**Complaint withdrawn**: 15.1%\n\n**Case proceeded**: 15%\n\n**Case ongoing or status unknown:** 21.3%\n\n>2017   Study into the FBI Database found that between 2006 to 2010 the  Average  number of false rape accusations or baseless accusations was  5.55%, and  robbery had a higher false and baseless accusation rate of  5.76%\n\nThis actually misrepresents what the study says. Here's a direct quote from the link:\n\n*Approximately 5% of the allegations of rape were deemed false or baseless. That was at least* ***five times higher than for most other offence types.***\n\nAnd   that's only in a legal context. In a social context, no one is going  to  accuse someone they don't like of murder. I suppose they *could*   make a false accusation of being robbed or beat up by that person, but   in the absence of bruises or a demonstration of lost property, it  would  be ineffectual and hard to believe. Rape does not have this  problem.  Many people have sex all the time. It is very easy to claim  that a night  of sex was rape, because it is a private act. There is no  way to prove  it's a false accusation.\n\n>Another   metastudy by Claire E. Ferguson, and John M. Malouff published in   December 17th, 2015 put the number of False Rape Accusations at 5%\n\nThis   one was behind a pay-wall, but I found the full text on sci-hub, and   thankfully they address exactly what I am talking about in the text:\n\n*Even   after the demonstrably false cases have been discovered, many more   equivocal cases exist which cannot be confirmed or denied, and even   recanted accusations may, in fact, be true. Researchers rarely address   this problem or state what level of certainty they applied in deciding   that a report was confirmed to be false. Additionally, after rates of   false reporting are given, few researchers discuss the many other cases   that were in doubt, but not proven or confirmed to be false.*\n\nIt'd be more accurate to say **2-10% of rape accusations** ***made to an investigative authority*** **will be** ***proven false.***\n\nHow Many People Falsely Accused of Rape Actually Go to Jail?\n\nThis   number does indeed seem to be low, which is a huge blessing, but I   think it misses the point and the text itself says a handful of very   problematic things.\n\nThe first important thing to note is that concern about false accusations doesn't exist exclusively, or even primarily, in a ***legal context***. It is more often a ***social context***.   Studies are rarely\/never done in that sphere, which is why so many of   these studies are not representative of the problem. The concern is not   that someone will go to the police and make a false accusation, but  that  they will go to your friends, family, and co-workers, and make a  false  accusation. That you will be fired, outcasted, kicked out of a  college,  etc, over someone else's word and their word alone.\n\n>The   vast majority of false rape accusers always accuse a non existent   stranger who raped them and usually not someone specifically\n\nThis   part is problematic because it seems to imply that a named accusation   is significantly more likely to be true, since \"most false accusations   name a non existent stranger.\" Once again, this isn't truly the case,   and ignores the context of what false rape accusation really represents   by hyperfocusing on accusations made to legal authorities.\n\nWhy Do False Rape Accusations Happen?\n\nThis   is also a very problematic section, falling into many of the same   fallacies that plague the previous section: Hyperfocusing on legal   reports instead of social ones.\n\n>Many   people who fear false rape accusations claim that women in the work   force will make a false accusation against a man in a higher position,   or a student who is going to fail an exam will accuse a professor of   rape, or a vengeful ex or a woman who regretted sex later.  \nThis   shows that the majority of the time, false accusers aren't the serial   accusers we hear through the media, nor are in tech jobs, nor college   students who regret sex. Instead it is usually either those looking to   access healthcare who cannot afford ito otherwise, teenagers trying to   get out of trouble and parents of children who make the vast majority of   false rape accusations.\n\nThe   reason why this data differs from what we hear through the media is   that the media is often covering accusations that were only made   socially, not legally. This is where regret sex accusations, accusations   against people in higher positions, students accusing professors,   vengeful exes, et cetera, happen.\n\nThese   people will not go to the police, they know they have no evidence.  They  will destroy your reputation, and never appear on any of these   statistics, and one really important concept to understand when trying   to examine false accusations:\n\n***Making   an accusation that can never be proven false is extremely easy, if it   is given even the bare minimum level of consideration***.\n\nConclusion\n\nI   understand that false rape accusations are an extremely divisive  notion  that is laced with political and social undertones, the likes of  which  are often very nasty. Nonetheless, it is very frustrating to see   intelligent people misusing statistics like this to imply that the  vast  majority of accusations should be considered true, because \"this  study  found only 2% were false.\" It gives people a way to clear their   conscience when they assume accusations are true.\n\nI   am not suggesting that there should be a swing to the opposite  extreme:  Assuming accusers are lying. This is equally awful. Support  can be  provided to accusers as victims without treating the accused  like they  are rapists. For those who have experienced a false  accusation, it can  take a tremendous toll on the psyche. It can ruin  lives, careers, etc,  and spreading notions like \"2 to 10% are false,  and most of those are  not against named individuals, and by people  trying to get medical care\"  gives people a pass \"backed by studies\" to  assume accusations are true.\n\nSupporting   the victim requires knowing who the victim is. If you assume   accusations are true, you are merely supporting an accuser that *might* be a victim, but you could be actively traumatizing a true victim.\n\nSo remember this TL;DR when you think about false rape accusations.\n\nTL;DR\n\n* All scientific estimates on the prevalence of false accusations refer to *provably false* accusations made to *authorities*. Not social ones like within friend groups, against celebrities, et cetera.","title":"65-85% of men accused of rape are innocent.

What went on in my head can be described pretty accurately by [this cartoon](https:\/\/xkcd.com\/642\/):  I was afraid that if my approaches were rejected, I would be guilty of having made a girl uncomfortable on a sexual level, and I would be punished for this \"sexual harassment\" in one way or another.  While I did not think I would get into any legal trouble, I did fear being shamed and\/or ostracized from my social circle for my unacceptable behavior.  When #MeToo trended, I felt confirmed about my anxiety.\n\nNow a lot of women stress that you cannot \"accidentally\" sexually harass someone:  If you stop when they give you a clear rejection, then nothing will happen to you.  However, this does not seem realistic to me.  If you expose your intentions by asking someone out of the blue if they want to have sex with you, then the question itself can already be very inappropriate.  Instead, flirting is about first hiding your intentions to a certain extent and only revealing them in certain stages of escalation.  Now some people are really good at giving the other person an idea what they want right from the beginning without making them feel uncomfortable about it, but it takes practice and everyone has to start somehow.  Even if you have only the best intentions, there are a lot of possibilities how things can go wrong, and you end up in a situation where your actions retrospectively appear very inappropriate.\n\nMany men like to summarize this by saying \"Sexual harassment is just flirting while ugly\" or talking about \"Schr\u00f6dinger's rapist\".  While this is certainly an oversimplified way to express things, I have often had similar thoughts.  Other men are like: \"Yeah, there are a lot of creeps out there, and those are the ones that women are complaining about.

The ironic thing about this is that the people accusing him of derailing seem to be the ones who are actually doing the derailing. They're saying that he's wrong to say there needs to be a discussion about boys raped by women, because (*they automatically presume*) he must only be saying it to take away from girls being raped by men\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem with this presumption is that **there's 0 evidence at all that he's saying what he is either to distract from female victims, or even in response to female victims.** The assumption seems to be that the only reason he's mentioning it is because of the R. Kelly scandal. The issue with this is that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. He makes no reference to R. Kelly, so the assumption that he must only be saying this in response to that situation is pretty baseless. In comparison, all of their reactions are in direct response to him saying we need to talk about boys abused by women. So he's saying *as a standalone Tweet* \"we need to talk about boys abused by women\". They're saying, *in response to his Tweet*, \"the real conversation is girls abused by men.\" And yet he's the one supposedly derailing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Currently, there's a lot of discussion in general about sexual abuse (not just with R. Kelly, but also with the #MeToo phenomenon, and many high profile cases involving both male and female victims). Saying something like boys abused by women should be discussed is not derailing or silencing anything. It's acknowledging a specific usually downplayed form of sexual violence and saying there should be more discourse about it. Which makes sense: considering how much discourse there is about sexual violence in general right now, why should this kind not be included? \n\n* It's like if health-conscious people are saying \"cancer is a big problem\"\n* And other health-conscious people say \"childhood obesity is a big problem\"\n* And the first health-conscious group says \"shut up about childhood obesity! You're taking away from the discussion of cancer!\" \n* \"But we're already talking about healthcare. Why should we not talk about childhood obesity?\"\n\nHonestly, their responses seem like a very dishonest and insidious form of projection. They're silencing the discourse of female-on-male sexual violence because it doesn't fit their narrative, but then they're trying to twist it to make it seem like they're the ones in the right. To make it seem like not only are they doing the right thing by focusing specifically on female victims, but also that anyone who does otherwise doesn't actually care about *any* victim\n\nI've seen and experienced this kind of thing so many times as a male victim of female-perpetrated sexual violence: where coming forward about personal experiences or discussing the issue in general *is derailed with accusations of derailment*. They claim things like \"yes, male victims should be discussed. But as a separate issue and not in response to female victims.\" Alright, fair enough\n\nAnd yet *any context* that female-on-male abuse is mentioned in (even when it's a standalone statement or account not in response to female victims, even when it's not claiming female victims are less important, even when it's not saying \"yeah, but what about the men?\"), it's always treated as if it is. **They automatically and baselessly assume that no man must actually care, and so if he says he's cares he must be lying and trying to draw attention away from women.** It's not as if we're saying \"since women are abusing boys, men must not be abusing girls.\" However it does seem like they're saying \"since men are abusing girls, we can't talk about the fact that women are abusing boys\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like these people don't realize that the discussion about male victims can be derailed, as well. They say don't talk about boys if it distracts from girls, but then they make things about girls anytime anyone mentions boys\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PS** There are also a ton of tweets basically saying \"yeah, but it's men who are the ones who laugh at male victims\" and even one saying [abusive men usually set up boys with the women who abuse them](https:\/\/twitter.com\/zaynah237\/status\/1082078983301353473), implying that it's really a man to blame when women rape boys (which is factually false, as [most female abusers work alone](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qQhEv9Ov7nQ) and it's a myth that women usually abuse at the behest of or with the help of men). That's another pretty insidious derailment tactic. \"Let's shift the blame from the women sexually abusing children to men, because sometimes men are also involved.\" That's like \"let stop blaming the men who rape women, and shift the blame to the women who have rape fantasies and those who traffic girls\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***TL;DR*** He literally made a standalone statement, not a retweet and no mention of female victims. How much more of a separate discussion can it get? The other person made a retweet to his beginning of a discussion basically saying \"you're silencing the real victims, who are girls\".

So despite the obvious tilt against feminist inspired ideas, please keep an open mind \ud83d\ude42.  Since feminists are interested in ending gender stereotypes, this kind of thing should fit right in (or at least be relevant to the movement in how they frame gender issues).\n\nThe paper itself came up with a \"gender distortion matrix\" that combines two forms of cognitive biases (amplification and minimization) that operate in a uniquely opposite manner when applied to gender (which they call a gamma bias).\n\nAnd many existing gender ideas can be thought of as operating inside of this bias, instead of being opposed to it. This is despite the fact that these ideas are often framed as being \"progressive\" and in favor of ending gender stereotypes.\n\nFor example, the idea of \"toxic masculinity\" is supposed to counteract negative masculine gender roles.  And while many people mean well when they use this term, the idea that society itself is responsible is absent from the terminology itself, as well as when people tend to use it.  Which shows how existing narratives about gender can inadvertently make gender biases worse, instead of better, even if unintentionally.\n\nFor example:\n\n>Negative attitudes towards masculinity have become widely accepted in mainstream public discourse in recent years. In contrast to the \u201cwomen are wonderful\u201d effect (Eagly et al. 1991), contemporary men are subject to a \u201cmen are toxic\u201d efect. The notion of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d has emerged and has even gained widespread credence despite the lack of any empirical testing (see chapter on masculinity by Seager and Barry). In general terms it appears as if attitudes to men have been based on generalisations made from the most damaged and extreme individual males.\n\nAnd later on:\n\n>There is a serious risk arising from using terms such as \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. Unlike \u201cmale depression\u201d, which helps identify a set of symptoms that can be alleviated with therapy, the term \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d has no clinical value. In fact it is an example of another cognitive distortion called *labelling* (Yurica et al. 2005). Negative labelling and terminology usually have a negative impact, including self-fulflling prophecies and alienation of the groups who are being labelled. We wouldn\u2019t use the term \u201ctoxic\u201d to describe any other human demographic. Such a term would be unthinkable with reference to age, disability, ethnicity or religion. The same principle of respect must surely apply to the male gender. It is likely therefore that developing a more realistic and positive narrative about masculinity in our culture will be a good thing for everyone.\n\nSo in an ironic twist, the otherwise \"progressive\" notion of toxic masculinity does nothing to help end gender stereotypes, but is instead itself exemplary of existing stereotypes against men. Steretypes which may be inadvertantly reinforced by the term instead of weakened by it.\n\nSociety has a \"men are toxic\" bias in much the same way that it also has a \"women are wonderful\" bias. And the fact that the term \"toxic masculinity\" has made its way through popular culture (divorced from it's original meaning) essentially proves this.\n\nThis is a theme found elsewhere in the paper where existing gender narratives are shown to make these kinds of biases worse, not better. Narratives about male privilege and things like #MeToo serve to help increase gender biases rather than get rid of them. And their widespread acceptance is itself proof of how deep these biases run in society.\n\nFor example:\n\n>We have also seen (above) that the concept of \u201crape culture\u201d exaggerates the perception of men as potential rapists and creates a climate of fear for women. Campaigns such as \u201c#MeToo\u201d can also play into a sense of fear that is based on distorted generalisations from small samples of damaged men to the whole male population.\n\nAnd on the issue of patriarchy theory:\n\n>The whole sociological concept of \u201cpatriarchy\u201d (see also chapter on masculinity by Barry and Seager) is predicated on the idea that it is a \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d. Specifcally, society is viewed as inherently privileging and advantageous for men and organised in ways that empower men and disempower and exclude women. This bold and sweeping hypothesis has received widespread acceptance despite being subject to relatively little academic evaluation, let alone being subject to empirical testing as a scientifc hypothesis. **This uncritical acceptance of a radical theory by mainstream society in itself indicates that gender distortions may be in operation on a large scale**. The concept of patriarchy focuses on an elite group of more powerful and wealthy males, whilst minimising the vast majority of men who are working class men, homeless men, parentally alienated men, suicidal men and other relatively disadvantaged male groups. It also minimises the benefts and protections involved in motherhood, family and domestic life for many women including the potential joys and rewards of raising children. Also the concept of patriarchy minimises the hardships of the traditional male role, such as fghting in wars, lower life expectancy, higher risk-taking and working in dangerous occupations.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nFrom:\n\nSeager, M., & Barry, J.

I was\/am a female athlete, and while I trained with, competed against, and beat plenty of male athletes, it was clear why we had our own competitions. While Laurel has the appropriate testosterone levels, it concerns me that she is competing with several other advantages such as increased bone density, increased hand\/foot size, increased height, all from her time pre-transition. It also concerns me that she competed in men's weightlifting comps up until transitioning, meaning she was building muscle mass as a man for decades. I think if someone transitions pre-puberty, they should be allowed in, but not someone who transitions in their 30s.\n\nAt the same time, as a feminist,  I am always resentful of these sort of articles, simply because of the sheer amounts of transphobia and misogyny that accompany them. Every time this comes up, I see a few disappointing and predictable responses:\n\n1. People that misgender and are unbelievably rude to the athlete. They call her \"he\" or \"that man\". As far as I'm concerned, Laurel Hubbard is a woman and can still be a woman, but a woman who is ineligible for competition. I will never understand why people feel the need to invalidate this woman's entire gender identity simply because of the Olympics. It's very hard to stay on the \"exclude her\" side when the other people on that side use transphobic insults.\n2. Far too often, the people the angriest about trans women's participation in the Olympics\/sports do not support women's sports, and call them inferior. Women's sports are not inferior and, if anything, female athletes need to overcome a much more significant biological handicap to achieve what we do. I will say it is frustrating beyond belief to see women and women's sports only being defended in light of transgender athletes rather than actual support.\n\nWith all that said, what is the solution? My initial thought would be to only allow trans women in women's sports who have transitioned pre-puberty. However, this does raise the issue that numerous areas do not allow pre-puberty transitions. Another option would be to create trans specific\/open leagues or to only allow trans athletes in non competitive sports (i.e. fun runs, intramural leagues).\n\nWhat does everyone think?\n\n**Edit: For transparency, I want to stress that I am not, nor was I ever a professional or even Division 1 college athlete.** I did high school sports, club sports in college (this is different from intramural in that it functions more like a real sports team rather than just people screwing around), and local age-group races. I mentioned my background to highlight that I've actually trained with both men and women in an environment that had high stakes *to me,* and that I've actually played sports. I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking I am\/was anywhere near the Olympic level, but more that I'm not a keyboard warrior who's never played a sport before.

It is an issue that primarily affects men, so it shouldn't be unheard of to think that the draft is sexist or even misandrist, right?\n\nWell, according to benevolent sexism, the reason only men were drafted in history is because of misogyny. Society viewed women as weak and incapable of fighting, and not because society possibly could've viewed men's lives as less valuable.\n\nAnother example is fathers being viewed as predatory when spending time with their own kids. Benevolent sexism claims that the reason this is happening is because we view women as only capable of raising children, not because there's an inherent bias against fathers \/ men spending time with children.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis goes on for almost every issue men may face.\n\nWorkplace fatalities being 95% male? Women being barred from dangerous jobs.\n\nRape of men not being taken seriously? Women are seen as weak and incapable of harming anyone.\n\nDomestic abuse of men not being taken seriously?

Men view emotions as feminine and therefore weak.\n\nThere's probably some more examples of this, but so far these are the ones that came to mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first reason I think this argument is flawed is because it is almost always used to derail discussions about men's issues by essentially saying \"actually, men are suffering because we hate women\". Which usually ends with them telling us that if we solve women's issues, men's issues will be solved automatically (i.e. trickle-down equality).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond reason is that we could literally turn this around and say that any issue women may face is a result of benevolent sexism against men.\n\nWage gap? Men are seen as only valuable for their labor and are therefore working more.\n\nPink tax? Products for men are of lower quality, therefore cheaper.\n\nWomen being barred from doing military service? Society views men as violent animals and their lives aren't seen as valuable.\n\nWomen being barred from dangerous jobs? Men's lives are seen as inherently less valuable, hence why we have no problem with them doing those jobs.\n\nWomen being raped at alarming rates? Men are pressured by society to have sex as to not be seen as a failure.\n\nGirls requiring higher scores to pass a test? Boys are seen as stupid.\n\nGirls having restrictive dress codes at school? Boys are viewed as unable to keep it in their pants.\n\nYou see where this is going, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis, along with \"Well men created the laws\" are two of the most infuriating counterarguments that I encounter often.\n\nSo, yeah.

I went to check out his twitter feed- and commented on one of his posts.  It started off cordially enough- he'd made some reference to \"boys do x men do y\"- and I made a comment about the man\/boy dichotomy.  He assumed initially that this was an \"internal debate amongst feminists\", and was having a polite discussion.\n\nThen I clarified that I wasn't a feminist, and that I was aligned ideologically with a group he thought of as a hate group.\n\nHe then blocked me, and followed that with going on a tear about \"pseudo intellectual MRAs\" and \"undergrad gender books\" (ignoring that *he* was the one pretending to know the writer I was referring to), expounding for several more tweets against what he presumed I must think, and capping up his angry outburst with a link to David Futrelle.\n\nHe didn't know it was me, so I sent him an email from the account he knows, \"coming out\" so that he could associate my handle with the guy he presumably used to respect.  And thus, presumably, ends a positive relationship in my life not just with one guy I liked, but everyone else in that clique.  I imagine I'll be woven into some cautionary tale about how even \"good guys\" can turn into toxic whatever.  I wouldn't mind if the criticism were in reaction to anything I think or said- but to have it in reaction to what it is presumed I think or say is... depressing.  And... yes.  In response to my email, he's now \"outed me\" to that group over twitter (still blocking me, so I can't even defend myself to my... I guess... former friends).  \n\nAnyway.  This sub is full of people who do not have that kind of response.  People who are willing to give people like me the benefit of the doubt, and let us condemn ourselves with our own words rather than the words you assume we'll give you.

In a study about the term toxic masculinity, participants were asked to articulate their opinions on the term and as expected most of them found the term to be very inflammatory and unhelpful for men.\n\nhttps:\/\/zenodo.org\/records\/3871217\n\n>Masculinity is frequently talked about in contemporary Western media as being in crisis, needing reform or even being \u2018toxic\u2019. However, no research to date has assessed the impact that this pervasive narrative might be having on people, particularly men themselves. This cross-sectional online pilot survey asked 203 men and 52 women (mean + SD age 46 + 13) their opinions about the terms toxic masculinity, traditional masculinity, and positive masculinity, and how they would feel if their gender was seen as the cause of their relationship or job problems. Most participants thought the term toxic masculinity insulting, probably harmful to boys, and unlikely to help men\u2019s behaviour.\n\nNow what I have heard people say on this is that this is a misinterpretation of the term and toxic masculinity does not mean masculinity or men in general are toxic. However that doesn't change the fact that the term can be very inflammatory and harmful as it is very commonly misused and a very oversimplified and misinterpreted term, the fact that it causes harm and stereotyping in boys and men according to the opinions of vast majority of men and women should indicate that using the term may steer people away from conversations or papers containing the term and therefore the term should be replaced with a better and more positive term. \n\nTake an example of the term 'mental retardation' this is a term that was often used by psychologists to describe a certain disability but recently the term has been replaced with intellectual disability. The reason? Well\n\nhttps:\/\/www.careinsurance.com\/blog\/health-insurance-articles\/what-is-mental-retardation\n\n>The term 'Mental Retardation' is no longer used as many people find it offensive. Hence it has been replaced by the term ' Intellectual Disability (ID)' also known as Intellectual Development Disorder (IDD). So now we know what is ID in mental health or what is IDD in mental health.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/documents\/2013\/08\/01\/2013-18552\/change-in-terminology-mental-retardation-to-intellectual-disability\n\n>The term \u201cintellectual disability\u201d is gradually replacing the term \u201cmental retardation\u201d nationwide. Advocates for individuals with intellectual disability have rightfully asserted that the term \u201cmental retardation\u201d has negative connotations, has become offensive to many people, and often results in misunderstandings about the nature of the disorder and those who have it.\n\nThe term mental retardation was changed to intellectual disability just because it caused offense and misinterpretation despite the term itself being more grounded and concrete than toxic masculinity. So if we can alter psychological terms just to accommodate to people's feeling and behaviours then why can't we do the same for toxic masculinity.\n\nThoughts?","title":"We should stop using the term 'toxic masculinity' as it is harmful","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1j0yuyv\/we_should_stop_using_the_term_toxic_masculinity\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

At the same time, I support many initiatives in the men's rights movement but find they spend far too much time and energy complaining about feminism instead of working on sociopolitical change to achieve the initiatives they want for men. \n\nWhen faced with the question of FGM, feminists overwhelmingly criticize and condemn the issue. There is no middle ground, no capitulation, no consideration of any conceivable benefit. Cutting a girl's genitals without medical necessity is wrong, harmful, and should be internationally criminalized for all time. \n\nFeminism has championed this cause based on their principles of consent, bodily integrity and autonomy, and sexual health. It is very, very rare to find someone who identifies as a feminist and is also pro, or even neutral on the topic of FGM. \n\nBut when the topic of male circumcision, the most prominent form of MGM is broached, feminists become divisive and their resolution wavers. \n\nBut why? \n\nWhy does a movement that champions the fight against FGM and claims to fight for women and men's equality become suddenly muddled when the discussion does a gender swap? Feminists may argue that MGM is a trivial issue that shouldn't be bothered with since FGM is so much worse and pressing. Some feminists will even argue against referring to male circumcision as genital mutilation at all, stating that doing so detracts from FGM. Or they will argue that cutting of a male child's genitals is a completely separate issue from cutting a female child's genitals altogether because the former confers health benefits and is, at worst, minimally disruptive to male sexuality (if at all) while the latter is done purely to remove women's ability to enjoy sex, confers a multitude of serious health issues, and has absolutely, positively, no conceivable health benefit whatsoever. \n\nIf you asked a random westerner, feminist or otherwise, off the street to explain the differences, this will probably be the answer you get most of the time. \n\nIf these typical westerners were asked to define FGM, you will probably get a definition along the lines of \"it's when they cut off a girl's clitoris\" and they may or may add that sometimes they sew up the vulva. \n\nHere's the kicker: that's incorrect... \n\n...sort of.\n\nWe need to consider the WHO's definition of FGM and *why* it's defined the way it is. Their definition is: \n\n[**Female genital mutilation (FGM) compromises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\"**](https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/female-genital-mutilation#:%7E:text=Female%20genital%20mutilation%20(FGM)\n\nNotice, there is no requirement for a certain level of harm, no mention of any specific anatomy, not even a mention of consent. It is a flat out, full stop, no bs, \"if it isn't done for medical reasons it's mutilation\" definition. \n\nThis is due to the reality of the situation. FGM is not a single practice, but rather an umbrella term for a variety of practices involving the genital cutting of females. Clitoral hoodectomy, labiaplasty, clitoridectomy, infibulation, genital piercings,\u00a0and even pricking the genitalia fall under the definition of FGM. As a note, when referring to clitoridectomy only the glans clitoris is removed as the majority of the structure is internal to the body. There is no known form of FGM practiced where the entire clitoris is removed. While the more extreme forms of FGM do occur, they are also the least common forms, infibulation being the rarest. The most common form is excising the clitoral hood, practiced throughout much of Southeast Asia and Islam. \n\nFor visuals, [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/XRid7jIUzMY) is a short video on each type and subtype. [NSFW warning] \n\nAnd yet, both in media and feminist rhetoric, the most extreme forms are conflated to represent all of FGM. In media this is for sensational content. Something with this much shock value presented to westerners generates likes and shares and tweets and votes. For feminists it's mostly a matter of convenience. Why spend over an hour explaining to someone all the nuances and details of genital cutting (assuming the person explaining even knows them) when they can just tell it as \"FGM when they cut off the clitoris so women can't enjoy sex.\" I'll admit that's an effective and efficient selling point. But most people will never bother to study this issue beyond that one sentence tag line.\n\nNow here is where the issues compound. We have a large number of feminists whose understanding of FGM amounts to a tag line or a paragraph. Further exposure to feminist rhetoric explains that patriarchy (and by extension, men) are responsible for the ills women face in society across all time and cultures. \n\nAs the misinformed spread their \"knowledge\" to the uninformed, a certain narrative evolves regarding this topic endlessly repeated by the bulk of self procalimed feminists that goes something like this: \n\n*Female genital mutilation is when they cut off a girl's clitoris. It was made by men to control women's sexuality and makes it impossible for them to enjoy sex.* \n\nI think it is safe so assume the members of this subreddit are aware of the misconceptions the average American and many westerners (including feminists) have about male circumcision. It's no surprise when someone who knows so little about both FGM and MGM comes to the five second conclusion that FGM is equivalent to castration while male circumcision is beneficial at best, benign at worst.\n\nIt should be noted that the idea of men and patriarchy being responsible for FGM doesn't hold water. In cultures that practice FGM, it is typically the women who perform the cutting of girls and argue in favor of the practice. The blanket accusation of patriarchy being responsible for FGM across all time and cultures and it's continuation today is a gross oversimplification at best. This paper goes more into detail on the topic:\n\n[Reconsidering the role of patriarchy in upholding female genital modifications: analysis of contemporary and pre-industrial societies](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41443-022-00581-5)\n\nAs another side note, data show that most victims of FGM, even the extreme forms still have sexual desire and pleasure. This is treating female sexuality as an overinflated balloon and taking anything sharp to it will make it pop, destroyed beyond repair. The idea that cutting the clitoris completely asexualizes them is hyperbolic in most cases.\n\n[Pleasure and Orgasm in Women with Female Genital Mutilation\/Cutting (FGM\/C)](https:\/\/www.jsm.jsexmed.org\/article\/S1743-6095(15\\)31699-4\/fulltext\\))\n\n[This Female Genital Mutilation Survivor Teaches Victims How To Enjoy Sex](https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/how-this-female-genital-mutilation-survivor-learned-to-love-sex_n_5759d1fae4b0e39a28ad0672\/amp#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16513566860411&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com)\n\n[A website by Dr. Fumbai Ahmadu, a woman who voluntarily underwent a ritual procedure to have her glans clitoris excised and works to promote female circumcision](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190209152221\/http:\/\/www.fuambaisiaahmadu.com\/)\n\nAnd what, I wonder, is the feminist response to these women who go against the narrative? Should they be told to shut up and keep quiet? Are they wrong and in fact not feeling any pleasure whatsoever? The fact that women are able to still enjoy sexual pleasure despite the damage done to their bodies does not diminish the real and measurable harms of FGM, but they do not need to be written off as lost causes either doomed to a life of sexual ineptitude.\n\nAnd even a lot of intactivists don't know that many female cutting surgeries are like male cutting in only cutting skin and membrane without cutting any part of the clitoris except for the hood. There are even surgeries that are called \"female circumcision\" that do not cut anything but merely separate any adhesions of the clitoral hood to the clitoris. That is called preputial adhesiolysis or what's known in intactivist circles as forcible retraction of the foreskin. That is also bad, but it's obviously not what people are usually thinking about when they're talking about \"female genital mutilation\" even though it falls under that umbrella term. \n\nImportant to note is that the people in cultures with female genital cutting always do compare male and female cutting. They have favorable views of cutting for both sexes and consider them the equivalent methods of improving the genitalia. There is no culture that cuts females that does not also cut males. And it these cultures, the female genital cutting is almost always performed by women who themselves were cut as girls, thereby repeating and passing on their trauma to the next generation. The idea of surgically improving the penis by destroying a large part of the skin is closely allied with the idea of improving the vulva with destructive surgery. \n\nFor a historical perspective, until the 1970's, the previous American medical understanding of female genital cutting was that there was no reason to criticize it because they wouldn't want anyone to criticize male genital cutting. Then in the '70s, feminists began in-depth reporting on the severity of various surgeries in Africa, and the narrative that male and female cutting are incomparable became incorporated as a bedrock premise in the American understanding of African female genital mutilation even though there were many feminist opponents of female cutting who also said male cutting is wrong too. Nevermind that African foreskin cutting rituals are also brutal and have been killing dozens to more than a hundred young men every year for decades without anyone raising an eyebrow. \n\nTo be fair, many feminists don't support male cutting including the majority of those who are FGM experts:\u00a0 \nFrench pioneer FGM researcher, [Hanny Lightfoot-Klein](http:\/\/www.fgmnetwork.org\/intro\/mgmfgm.html); Sudanese FGM researcher, [Nahid Toubia](\/r\/Intactivists\/wiki\/index#wiki_evolutionary_cultural_ethics_and_the_circumcision_of_children); [Alice Walker](http:\/\/www.noharmm.org\/FGCsay.htm); Somali anti-FGM activist, [Soraya Mire](http:\/\/www.noharmm.org\/FGCsay.htm); Somali-Dutch politician, [Ayaan Hirsi Ali](http:\/\/youtu.be\/NaEoQVZnN8I); Somali-British anti-FGM activist, [Shamis Dirir](http:\/\/www.noharmm.org\/dirir.htm); and most of the 15 authors of Seven Things to Know about Female Genital Surgeries in Africa ([PDF file](http:\/\/www.taskforcefgm.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/hast81.pdf)\u2014[excerpt below](\/r\/Intactivists\/wiki\/index#wiki_the_popular_perception_of_female_genital_surgeries_is_distorted)). \n\nOther feminists who support body autonomy rather than infant genital cutting include: popular internet feminist, [Laci Green](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130501095940\/http:\/\/lacigreen.tv\/sexplus\/sexuality\/4109-whyiopposecircumcision); popular feminist, [Gloria Steinem](http:\/\/www.noharmm.org\/FGCsay.htm); Jewish intactivist feminist, [Miriam Pollack](http:\/\/www.noharmm.org\/pollack.htm)\u2014[Intact America link](http:\/\/www.intactamerica.org\/pollack); Australian feminist, [Germaine Greer](http:\/\/triggeralert.blogspot.com\/2011\/01\/germaine-greer-on-male-female-genital.html); Egyptian feminist, [Seham Abd el Salam](http:\/\/www.noharmm.org\/muted.htm); British journalist, [Catherine Bennett](http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2012\/jul\/22\/catherine-bennett-circumcision-is-bad); intactivist feminist, [Tina Kimmel](http:\/\/www.cirp.org\/news\/nocirc12-7-00\/); intactivist feminist, [Travis Wisdom](http:\/\/brightonmanplan.wordpress.com\/2012\/03\/18\/challenging-feminism-on-male-circumcision\/) \u2014 [Questioning Circumcisionism: Feminism, Gender Equity, and Human Rights](http:\/\/www.academia.edu\/1704611\/Challenging_Circumcisionism_and_Hegemonic_Masculine_Beauty_through_Non-Surgical_Foreskin_Restoration); intactivist feminist, [Cate Nelson](http:\/\/ecochildsplay.com\/2011\/07\/07\/why-circumcision-is-a-feminist-issue\/);\u00a0 \nand many nurses and midwives including: [Marilyn Milos](http:\/\/www.cirp.org\/library\/ethics\/milos-macris\/)\u2014[Intact America bio](http:\/\/www.intactamerica.org\/marilynmilos); Canadian nurse, [Kira Antinuk](http:\/\/stopthecutting.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/ne_09-01-2013-forcedgenitalcutting.pdf);\u00a0 US intactivist nurse, [Rosemary Romberg](http:\/\/www.noharmm.org\/feminist.htm);\u00a0 Canadian midwife, [Gloria Lemay](http:\/\/www.glorialemay.com\/blog\/?p=581); and the [Santa Fe Nurses](http:\/\/www.nocirc.org\/symposia\/third\/nrc.html) who stand as conscientious objectors refusing to participate in non-therapeutic infant genital cutting. \n\nDespite prominent feminists supporting a gender neutral stance on genital mutialtion of minors, feminism heavily supports all anti FGM policies and legislation while seeming to only silently approve of anti MGM policies and legislation from the sidelines, even as equal protections for boys continuously falls flat on it's face. I am specualtaing here but I will give my best two reasons: \n\n1 Feminism's prerogative is women's rights, not men's. They are under no obligation to take charge of progress for men. Feminism also deals with many issues besides genital mutilation. Banning MGM simply is not a priority for the movement. \n\n2 America is a male genital cutting culture. There is a large medical establishment that profits every day off harvesting the sex organs of baby boys. Our textbooks, even the ones used for medical students, are lacking on basic penile anatomy and function. Male circumcision activists push to export circumcision to the rest of the world. We overvalue religious freedom to the point of allowing MGM, child marriage and rape of Mormon girls, and denying children life saving medical treatment based on parental wishes. If feminism came at this issue with gender neutral intentions, they would have a long, costly fight in front of them. But if they were to kick the boys to the curb and advocate just for the protection of girls, they have a quick and east victory. There's no one to oppose them. \n\nHere's where I get annoyed. I fully believe that if feminism threw their weight and influence behind this issue, we would have seen it banned by now. Not this indirect route of \"dismantling patriarchy\" (whatever that means that will somehow result in MGM being abandoned) but by advocating directly for altering anti FGM laws to be gender neutral. Instead, they allow rampant misinformation to spread even among feminists and their sense of urgency to do something about MGM is nill since they got what they were after with the anti FGM movement. \n\nUltimately this overall apathy towards MGM only hurts feminism's goals. For example, the AAP 2012 Technical Report on Circumcision made the claim that the health benefits of circumcision outweighed the risks and justified the procedure. Problem is, [the claimed benefits were ludicrous](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Intactivism\/comments\/hxmbpn\/refutations_of_the_alleged_benefits_of_infant\/). They set such a low bar for what constitutes a \"health benefit\" one could justify amputating just about anything. In terms to FGM and those who advocate for it, this provides some chinks in the armor: \n\n* Females have higher rates of UTIs. Why aren't we protecting our girls?\n* Females also contract STIs. Why aren't we protecting our girls?\n* Females also suffer from genital cancers.\u00a0 Why aren't we protecting our girls?\n* Females also have a smell betwixt their legs.\u00a0 Why aren't we blessing our girls with more hygienic genitals? \n* We bring our boys into the covenant.\u00a0 Why should our girls be excluded? \n\nThink that will never happen? Because the AAP published a paper on it in 2010! \n\n[Ritual Genital Cutting of Female Minors](https:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/125\/5\/1088?ijkey=9bacdd06ed9b3a107453714ce1c4fd9e354c25b0&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) \n\nFun fact, the main author of this paper was the bioethicist for their 2012 paper on male circumcision!

The Problem with Medicalizing Morality](http:\/\/blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk\/2017\/08\/does-female-genital-mutilation-have-health-benefits-the-problem-with-medicalizing-morality\/) \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, outlawing genital cutting of one sex but allowing it for the other is untenable in the long run. Despite being [outlawed federally](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/104th-congress\/house-bill\/941\/text) in 1996, America's anti FGM law FGM not brought into play until 2018 when members of the Dawoodi Borah in Michigan were arrested for performing type 4 FGM. The result was a federal judge ruling the law unconstitutional. This was only rewritten into law in late 2020, but it is questionable whether this one would hold up. America is also the only county to not have ratified the UN Declaration for the Rights of the Child. Presumably to protect the religious freedom of parents in this country as well as our practice of male circumcision. \n\n[Why was the U.S. ban on female genital mutilation ruled unconstitutional, and what does this have to do with male circumcision?](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/341965054_Why_Was_the_US_Ban_on_Female_Genital_Mutilation_Ruled_Unconstitutional_and_What_Does_This_Have_to_Do_With_Male_Circumcision) \n\n[Why Male Circumcision Defenders are Fighting to Legalize FGM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/GBH0g_Cl7Rk) \n\nIn general, here are some really good research papers explaining the double standards and debunking justifications for selective zero tolerance of genital mutilation: \n\n* [Darby et al. 2007](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/7104790\/A_rose_by_any_other_name_Symmetry_and_asymmetry_in_male_and_female_genital_cutting) \\- A rose by any other name: symmetry and asymmetry in male and female genital cutting\n* [Gore 2010](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/9306615\/Analysis_on_Western_Discourses_on_Genital_Cutting?email_work_card=view-paper) \\- Analysis on Western discourses on genital cutting\n* [Earp 2014](http:\/\/blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk\/2014\/02\/female-genital-mutilation-and-male-circumcision-time-to-confront-the-double-standard\/) \\- Female genital mutilation (FGM) and male circumcision: should there be a separate ethical discourse?\n* [Earp 2015](http:\/\/belmont.bme.umich.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/377\/2018\/02\/3-Female-genital-mutilation-and-male-circumcision-toward-an-autonomy-based-ethical-framework.pdf) \\- Female genital mutilation and male circumcision: toward an autonomy-based ethical framework\n* [Darby 2016](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/27422264\/Moral_hypocrisy_or_intellectual_inconsistency?email_work_card=view-paper) - Moral hypocrisy or intellectual inconsistency?

Don't get me wrong, I would love if they came charging in like the Ride of the Rohirrim to save the day on this. Even then, it would be quite insulting if they were only working to ban MGM as a means to solidify the protection of girls from FGM rather than viewing boy's rights as something worth fighting for for it's own sake. \n\nHere is what the defacto feminist view should be on male circumcision: \"Circumcision is male genital mutilation, it is a violation of boy's bodily autonomy, and any feminist worth her salt should oppose it and protect.\" That's it. Feminism does not need to take the lead on this issue, they don't need to make it about girls having a worse with FGM, there's no hypocrisy or double standards, and they are directly making the life of any of their future sons better by protecting them from a harmful cultural practice. Case closed. Feminists and MRAs agree on something.\n\nFinally, for the feminists who are in this sub and understand the issue at large. First off, thank you for your support. We all have our spheres of influences. As feminists, you are critical at holding accountability among other feminists who perpetuate misinformation, or those that downplay the harms of MGM, or those who were not harmed by FGM piggyback on the suffering actual FGM victims so they can claim victimhood for themselves. We cannot afford to treat equality as a zero sum game and genital mutilation of children will only be solved as a human right issue, not as a war of the sexes.","title":"Feminism and anti MGM intactivism","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/o2rrkl\/feminism_and_anti_mgm_intactivism\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

It is an uneasy acknowledgement that liberal ideals, if embraced completely, leave the door open to the destruction of liberalism. It presents a question with no comfortable solution. It is absolutely not a demand that we trample the rights of people whose ideas we don't like.\n\nHere's the actual argument:\n\n> Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.\u2014In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.\n\nFirst of all, it is not talking simply about tolerance but about \"unlimited tolerance.\" It's not saying you should extend no tolerance to the intolerant, simply that you should not extend unlimited tolerance to them.\n\nIt is explicitly not an open justification for any and all silencing tactics.\n\n> In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise.\n\nIt seems that the people who abuse this argument might actually be the \"intolerant\" Karl Popper was warning us about.\n\n> for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. \n\nThese are the people who refuse to engage on the level of rational argument. Rather than debate, they pull fire alarms. They will \"cancel\" people from their side who dare to talk to their ideological opponents.

However, it never really explicitly defines feminism in any real detail, relying instead on the reader piecing together a vague understanding of the movement from this history lesson.\n\nIt also appears confused about it\u2019s purpose. Her message is frequently directed, not at non-feminists, but at those who already identify as feminist. She is trying to pull them back into line which what she considers to be true feminism.\n\nReading the history of the feminist movement as bell hooks tells it, It became clear to me where many of my problems with feminism originated.\n\n> Before women's studies classes, before feminist literature, individual women learned about feminism in groups. The women in those groups were the first to begin to create feminist theory which included both an analysis of sexism, strategies for challenging patriarchy, and new models of social interaction.\n\n*If feminist theory is built on the perspectives of women that would be fine if it was accepted as simply another way of looking at the world. However it is generally not. Most feminists assert feminism as the only valid way to look at gender.*\n\n*You absolutely cannot validly interpret men\u2019s issues within a framework build entirely on the female perspective.*\n\n*In most people\u2019s personal internal narratives about their lives, they are the good guys, or at least not the bad guys. This is why men\u2019s problems keep getting framed as their own oppression of women backfiring on them. The framework is built to avoid women being cast as a the bad guys.*\n\n>Early on feminist activists focused so much attention on private bonds and domestic relationships because it was in those circumstances that women of all classes and races felt the brunt of male domination, whether from patriarchal parents or spouses.\n\n*This is the worst perspective from which to start building a model for systemic oppression. Men dominating their wives are acting as individuals and the group of women discussing the problem were self-selecting. The women who were not being dominated by their husbands would not be showing up to meetings to discuss not being dominated. No counter-evidence would be seen.*\n\n>And given the connection between male domination and sexual violence it is not surprising that women who had been involved with men were often the most vocal about their sexual unhappiness.\n\n*The women who were unsatisfied in hetereosexual relationships complained more than those in homosexual relationships because they were supported by the narrative, thus reinforcing that narrative. This all looks like one big feedback loop.*\n\nShe uses \u201cmale domination\u201d and \u201cpatriarchy\u201d almost interchangeably. This concept is central to her worldview.\n\nMy understanding of her point of view is that this is a system in which power differentials are central and in which those with more power dominate those with less power.\n\nShe uses terms which imply a connection with men because she believes that this is a system imposed by men, based on male values.\n\nI consider this to be an incorrect and misandric belief.\n\nWomen participate in and promote this system as much as men do. They are just not encouraged to seek the same types of power within it.\n\nThis is not a male system. It is a human system. In fact, it's barely a system. It is a law of nature. There will always be power differentials between individuals and those with more power will dominate those with less. That's what power is, the ability to impose your will. That's the whole point having power. It allows you to get your way.\n\nIn fact, the parts of human society related to power, which could rightfully be called systems actually do the opposite. They limit power, discourage its abuse and add accountability.\n \nThere is no reason to believe that if women were encouraged to seek the same forms of power men are (which is exactly what most feminists want) they would behave any differently.\n\nIn fact, in the forms of power which women have traditionally held more of (forms which most feminists deny or ignore) we can see equivalent domination behavior. Look at the behavior frequently seen between popular and unpopular girls at high school. Look at the cliques of women which even form in the workplace and the bullying which can accompany them.\n\nBell hooks, herself, provides examples of women using power to dominate less powerful women and children. She just somehow blames men, who aren't involved at all in these scenarios. She even has examples of rich white women using their class and race power, in the feminist movement itself, to dominate other women.\n\nAs I'll go over the character limit if I include my breakdowns of the positives and negatives I found, I'll include them as comments under this post.\n\n**What should I read next?**\n\nThanks \/u\/simplyelena for this suggestion.

The mental ability of the victim is it seems some what in question. While he is non verbal through what is now \n\n>largely rejected by the scientific community who point to many studies that prove the facilitator unconsciously influences the outcome. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to experts [including the medical anthropologist Devva Kasnitz who appears in the documentary] who say that even if it works a little bit then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d says August-Perna. \u201cOthers, such as Howard Shane [a speech pathologist who also features and who later diagnosed Derrick as having the mental capacity of a one year old] have have been sceptics right from the inception of FC. \n\nVery often it seems in cases like these the media seeks to humanize the rapist using lines such as \n\n>Her eyes sparkle when she talks about Derrick, the way a teenager might talking about a first crush.\n\nIt reminds me very much of lines in the book Lolita which on a superficial reading is often misinterpreted, the narrator is the villain. The writing is meant to not make you sympathetic but to be horrified that you may be understand the narrators warp view. Just as the man in Lolita is delusional and romanticized the \"relationship\" he had with a young girl \n\n>she holds onto her version of what happened. \n\nWould anyone give a man this poetic apologia? Would we say, it\u2019s easy to see ~~Stubblefield\u2019s~~*Humbert Humbert* story as a tragedy? Would we question his rape with honeyed words saying \n\n>Whether you consider ~~her~~*him* a fantasist, an abuser, a ~~woman~~*man* blinded by a ~~white saviour~~*hero* complex, or simply someone driven by an overwhelming belief that ~~Derrick~~*Dolores* could have a different sort of life.\n\nWe certainly would not ever say it \n\n>can be seen as a story of two women \u2013 Daisy, Stubblefield, and their battle over a man\n\nIt is causes a considerable amount of fury for me that so many people refuse to acknowledge the problem on how we view potential abusers. This rapist was a well educated married woman with 2 children. She could have easily been targeting a child, as her victim seems to not be able to consent and was is stated to have been diagnosed with profound physical and mental disabilities in a second article on this rapist written in 2018. A person's sexual attraction does not make them any more or less likely to act on that attraction just as being an activist college professor in her 40s means shes safe around anyone at all times. If we had the narrative that pedophila was primarily a thing done by women would we have the same reaction to it? This and so many other female on male rape cases suggests we would not. These cases suggest the prejudice and vitriol we have for M.A.P.s would be very muted and we would be much more sympathetic. Which would be a good thing as if that were the case we could perhaps actually help them and prevent these cases rather than djust react after the fact. \n\nThis man is an overlooked victim. His abuse romanticized and debated, yet I dont see any rape victim advocates coming out of the wood work to decry this documentary? I dont see feminists staging protests screaming about how this movie is rape apologetics?

The norms that result in this are only part of a much larger set of gender norms that benefits women in some ways and men in others and harms men in some ways and women in others.\n\nThis immediately turns off people who see the harm gender norms inflicted on men and don't accept it as the result of privilege backfiring. It also prevents those who accept the framing from seeing the bigger picture, assuming patriarchy is the entirety of the cause and the symptoms.\n\nHaving a discussion about the harms and unfair benefits from gender norms and how they are perpetuated would incorporate all of the complaints about patriarchy without being one-sided.\n\n* Toxic masculinity \/ Internalised Misogyny\n\nBoth \"toxic masculinity\" and \"internalised misogyny\" are about the taking on board the damaging parts of the norms related to your gender. The lack of symmetry in the terms means we approach them in very different ways.\n\nDiscussions of \"toxic masculinity\" focus on the agency of the men who express it. They are totally responsible for accepting these norms. The absence of discussion of positive masculinity and toxic femininity also creates an association between the word toxic and the concept of masculinity.\n\nOn the other hand referencing \"misogyny\" in \"internalised misogyny\" makes it sound like something women are victims of. It downplays their responsibility for taking on board these toxic norms.\n\nThis \"men are agents, women are victims\" perspective only reinforces damaging gender norms.\n\nAs many people refuse to accept misandry is a thing, my suggestion would be to start discussing all four combinations of positive\/negative and masculinity\/femininity, or simply talk about toxic gender norms.\n\n* The wage gap\n\nThe average woman earns significantly less than the average man. Just this raw fact paints a picture of rampant discrimination on the part of employers. However, this is not the case. While discrimination probably contributes a little, most of this gap is due to the average woman making different career choices to the average man.\n\nThere is a conversation to be had about the different pressures placed on boys\/men and girls\/women and the outcomes these produce. However, this is rarely the discussion you get when you bring up the wage gap.\n\nMost people will go one of two ways. Some, generally those already primed to see female oppression, will take it at face value and assume it is discrimination. Others will assume that the case is being made for discrimination and, seeing it is the result of different choices, dismiss the entire concept. Very few will go on to discuss the real issue.\n\nHow to solve it? Start from the other end. Talk about the different pressures placed on the genders and then go onto talk about the wage gap as one of the many negative outcomes of this.\n\n* Benevolent sexism\n\nThis is part of a larger problem in the rhetoric which insists that sexism can only ever be directed at women. You can come up with whatever definition of sexism you like but ultimately, gender-based prejudice and discrimination is not good, no matter what you call it.\n\n\"Benevolent sexism\" is the result of framing everything based on how it impacts women. To call it \"benevolent\" requires that you ignore the effect on men. Discriminating in favor of one group is discriminating against everyone else.\n\nYes, there are sinister aspects to \"benevolent sexism\" which play a part in keeping women in their gender role but the gender-flipped dynamic is classified under \"patriarchy hurts men too.\" \n\nIf you want to get men involved in talking about the harm inflicted by gender-based prejudice and discrimination, maybe pushing the harm it does to them out of frame is not the best approach. \n\nHow about we just talk about sexism (or some other word if we can't accept sexism happens to men too). There's always one gender which benefits and one which is harmed. Looking at the problem from the side which benefits tells the other side that they don't matter.","title":"How to frame an important discussion in exactly the wrong way","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4juvop\/how_to_frame_an_important_discussion_in_exactly\/","upvote_ratio":0.95,"over_18":false}

And it reminded me of several other posts and articles I've read through. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.dailyedge.ie\/unsolicited-vagina-pics-2464875-Nov2015\/\n\nThis one is one such example that immediately comes to mind. But it's not particularly labelled as a \"feminist\" article. \n\nAnother one is Norah Vincent. Who spent several months pretending to be a man and found the exact opposite of what she expected. \n\nHer experiences showed her that it's possible feminists might not fully understand how masculinity works - it is a movement started and led mostly by women. Men are a pretty diverse group of people - They are half the population after all - They have different lived experiences, race, background, upbringing, looks, build. And every single one of these groups or individuals treat other men and women very differently. However men are often seen as a monolithic group save a few politically accepted lines such as race and sexuality.\n\nI've also seen similar conversations about terms like \"toxic masculinity\" The kind of 'toxic masculinity' feminists talk about does not accurately reflect what the vast majority of men I have spoken to identify with. In terms of things like \"not showing emotion\" many have identified that when they bottle up emotions it isn't because it's \"feminine\" to let them out. It's because they have faced scorn or some other form of social consequences for doing so in the past. \n\nI am a woman. and this honestly did feel alien to read. I feel as though my showing emotions is often met with empathy and attempts to comfort me. This happens to such an extent that I presumed it to be the norm. but I've spoken to and read stories from several men who have echoed that they have faced ostracism, punishment and even had relationships ruined because they showed vulnerability and emotion. \n\nAs one user put it. \n\n>Too many feminist articles frame men's problems in terms of some arbitrary attachment to masculinity they seem to think men have, when in fact men's problems come from specific gendered disadvantages men face, to which a preoccupation with masculinity is a rational response.\n\n>Men simply cannot adopt 'feminine' social roles. If men are not confident and socially assertive their social networks wither and dry up because social assertiveness is needed to counter the negative impact of the natural suspicion and distrust people view men with. If men open up emotionally they do not receive the same support and affection that women do. Men who go into 'care roles' are treated with exhausting hostility and suspicion. Men have fewer sources of economic support and far more expectation to support others than women do so men cannot opt for lower paying jobs or take on more domestic responsibilities since this massively harms their romantic prospects and makes men much more vulnerable to economic hardship and homelessness.\n\nI'd like to hopefully delve into this some more. So I would like to direct this conversation towards a few points. \n\n1. If anybody has similar experiences of anecdotes to flesh out this idea more thoroughly I would love to hear them (as stated, I am a woman so I cannot effectively offer my own experiences of what the male experience is like)\n\n2. If anybody has any novel ideas on how this gap can be bridged I am certain that it would make for interesting discussions.","title":"I feel as though one of the main issues plaguing the discourse around gender issues is that feminist frameworks often to not acknowledge or understand the male perspective.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/y550cq\/i_feel_as_though_one_of_the_main_issues_plaguing\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

It has been fully debunked. \n\nThis has long been an issue of contention for historians. Quoting Mary Beard, feminist historian and suffragette, \n\nhttps:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/beard\/woman-force\/index.htm\n\n>If one works backward in history hunting for the origin of this idea, one encounters, near the middle of the nineteenth century, two illuminating facts: (1) the idea was first given its most complete and categorical form by American women who were in rebellion against what they regarded as restraints on their liberty; (2) the authority whom they most commonly cited in support of systematic presentations of the idea was Sir William Blackstone, author of Commentaries on the Laws of England \u2013 the laws of the mother country adopted in part by her offspring in the new world (see below, Chapter V). The first volume of this work appeared in 1765 and the passage from that volume which was used with unfailing reiteration by insurgent women in America was taken from Blackstone\u2019s chapter entitled \u201cOf Husband and Wife.\u201d..\n\n>Since such were the rights of women in Equity as things stood in 1836, fortified by a long line of precedents stretching back through the centuries, it seems perfectly plain that the dogma of woman\u2019s complete historic subjection to man must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind.\n\nThis an important issue today, when power among middle eastern societies is mostly ignored because it's not as formal and open as men's power.\n\nhttps:\/\/anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1525\/ae.1974.1.3.02a00100\n\nWomen could lead armies, own businesses, were entitled to half of property, men weren't allowed to beat their wives, women could divorce, women had dowerages which worked essentially like alimony today, women received the right to vote shortly after men without being required to fight and die for their country.\n\nOn a particular issue, one of the husband owning the property, this book gives more details.\n\nhttps:\/\/books.google.com.my\/books?id=AfFBAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\n\n>\"Courts of Equity for many purposes treat the husband and wife as the civil law treats them, as distinct persons, capable (in a limited sense) of contracting with each other, of suing each other, and of having separate estates, debts, and interests. A wife may in a Court of Equity sue her husband and be sued by him. And in cases respecting her separate estate, she may also be sued without him, although he is ordinarily required to be joined, for the sake of conformity to the rule of law, as a nominal party whenever he is within the jurisdiction of the court and can be made a party.\"\n\nThey could even own property separately. \n\n>\"Courts of Equity have, for a great length of time, admitted the doctrine, that a married woman is capable of taking real and personal estate to her separate and exclusive use; and that she has also an incidental power to dispose of it.\"\n\nIn fact, the law often benefited women in this place.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Sketches-disposition-accomplishments-employments-importance\/dp\/1140792164\n\n>\u201cIt is no uncommon thing, in the present times, for the matrimonial bargain to be made so as that the wife shall retain the sole and absolute power of her own fortune, in the same manner as if she were not married. But what is more inequitable, the husband is liable to pay all the debts which his wife thinks proper to burden him with, even though she have abundance of her own to answer that purpose. He is also obliged to maintain her, though her circumstances be more opulent than his.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/www.history.org\/foundation\/journal\/spring04\/women.cfm\n\nIf you look at historical records of trade, there are women's names in every profession. Women could and did enter many trades, and had opportunities to work at many a job. \n\nOn the subject of armies, Jean A Truax in Anglo-Norman Women at War: Valiant Soldiers, Prudent Strategists or Charismatic Leaders? she notes it was routine for women to be expected to command armies. A quote from one account. \n\n>...kept sleepless watch; every night she put on a hauberk like a soldier and, carrying a rod in her hand, mounted on to the battlements, patrolled the circuit of the walls, kept the guards on the alert, and encouraged everyone with good counsel to be on the alert for the enemy\u2019s stratagems.\n\nIn terms of why women were not routinely in large armies, it's because recruiters didn't want them. They wanted to protect women and keep them safe at home. They forcefully conscripted men instead.\n\nThat said, in militias and sieges it was common to recruit women, as they would be close to their home. \n\nWomen were not actually required to stay off the battlefield. If you could personally buy a horse, sword, and equipment, you could probably fight in many a war. From the fourth crusade, say, Nicetas Choniates said. \n\n>Females were numbered among them, riding horseback in the manner of men, not on coverlets side-saddle but unashamedly astride, and bearing lances and weapons as men do; dressed in masculine garb, they conveyed a wholly martial appearance, more mannish than the Amazons.\n\n Matilda of Tuscany was known to routinely charge in on horseback with her knights, and had many great successes in battle. She was famous for defeating the Holy Roman Empire on behalf of the pope and forcing him to walk barefoot through snow in apology. \n\nOn the issue of marital rape, this was certainly an issue for both genders. There was an expectation of sex in marriage, and if you failed to perform, you could be divorced. That said, it was illegal to assault your partner, so you could resist certainly.\n\nThis was often enforced by the state.\n\nThe Lamentations of Little Matheus.\n\n>\"My wife wants it, but I can\u2019t. She petitions for her right. I say no. I just can\u2019t pay.\"\n\n>\"Even given his sexual incapacity, Matheolus was subject to corporal punishment:\n\n>\"Acting as her own advocate, Petra [his wife] puts forward the law that if a shriveled purse [scrotum] can\u2019t pay because it\u2019s empty, under statute recompense for that injury is corporal punishment.\"\n\nMen and women both had the right to have their partner beaten by the law if they refused sex, and this was a right both men and women took up, though women more than men from what I have seen of records. \n\nAnyway, a final quote, to show how men viewed women having great accomplishments from the first woman doctor.\n\n\n>\"The behaviour of the medical class during the two years that I was with them was admirable. It was that of true Christian gentlemen. I learned later that some of them had been inclined to think my application for admission a hoax, perpetrated at their expense by a rival college. But when the bona-fide student actually appeared they gave her a manly welcome, and fulfilled to the letter the promise contained in their invitation.\"\n\n>\"The admission of a woman for the first time to a complete medical education and full equality in the privileges and the responsibilities of the profession produced a widespread effect in America. The public press very generally recorded the event, and expressed a favourable opinion of it. Even in Europe some notice of it was taken, and 'Punch' showed his cordial appreciation by his amusing but friendly verses.\"\n\nThis has been my experience in the modern day. When women seek the same accomplishments and achievements as men, they receive praise and warm hearts for their hard efforts.\n\nSo, there is no need to feel a historical pain over this. Women did in some cultures face special oppression from the rich, but for the most part, men and women worked together for common causes and were open to women having many positive paths forward.","title":"Women were not, on a large scale, historically oppressed by virtue of their gender.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/kueqij\/women_were_not_on_a_large_scale_historically\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are required to stay and fight, even as their families evacuate. The same policy is used by both sides: for example the Russian aligned region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine [prohibits men aged 18-55 from leaving](https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/02\/22\/europe\/ukraine-russia-donbas-evacuees-intl\/index.html).

Sadly there is no translation available yet and very few English interviews\/reviews exist so I'll try to give an unbiased recap first (the only other English source I found for comparison: [Link](https:\/\/forbetterscience.com\/2021\/03\/18\/female-choice-by-meike-stoverock-book-review\/) ). Sorry for the wall of text, with the recap it exploded ... TLDR at the bottom.\n\n##Recap\n\nThe book is named \"Female Choice - Of the beginnings and the end of male civilization\". Essentially her thesis is that during the last few thousand years of human history, thanks to the agricultural revolution, men ended up running the show due to the large amount of food and safety they could generate. When this changed society from a (more) egalitarian tribal society to large civilizations that had a seperation of public and private life, women ended up being locked into the \"mother\" role and haven't gotten out from that.\n\nIn nature however, the (title-giving) principle of Female Choice is the leading system. Females of a species are nondescript, while sexual dimorphism makes the males woo the females through elaborate strategies or expensive sexual characteristics (for humans: Height, Strength, Beard ...). Marriage\/Monogamy has completely undermined this system: While in nature few men would successfully reproduce and the top men were basically responsible for fathering all the children (aka women sharing chad), in monogamy almost every male, regardless of sexual attractivity gets a chance at reproducing if he only does as society tells him: Grow up, (join the army, survive,) get a degree.\n\nShe goes further to say that with monogamy becoming less relevant these days men need to realize that it's not going to continue as it once has. You can't just get your degree and your free wife alongside. Many men will not be able to reproduce so we, as a society, need to learn to respect sexually unsuccessful men: 80% of women go for 20% of men but this doesnt mean that 80% of men are crap, it just means that 20% of men are special, the exception. She even says that if we were to revert to a female choice society the amount of incels would seriously increase so measures need to be put in place to \"normalize\" incels: The narrative needs to be changed from \"You have sex? You are awesome? You don't ? You are a loser\" to something that allows these men to be respected: It should not be irrelevant whether a boy is generally beneficial to society (good traits like being friendly, helpful, a great artist, empathic, etc) just because he is too short and has a a high pitched voice.\n\nShe actually admits to not having a solution to the problem that women prefer men by their physical criteria, meaning the advantages of male civilization (allowing men to apply themselves in science, arts and medicine instead of sexual competition) are diminished by reverting back to a society where women reward aggressive jocks over the Stephen Hawkings and MLKs of this world.\n\n##Thoughts\n\nFirst of all I am glad that, because it's postulated by a woman and as a feminist theory, this shit can finally become mainstream. I'll admit that I'm somewhat of an incel so I have both lived some of the experiences she describes and studied some of the principles she describes: I am very tired of having to argue that women are biological creatures as well and do NOT in fact decide their partners on rational criteria like Emotional Maturity, stability but instead sexual attractiveness.\n\nThe sexy son hypothesis says that the single best thing a mother can do for her sons is to procreate with an attractive male because having a son that is an attractive male means he'll be one of the successful 20% of the next generation which equals many grandchildren and thus great reproductory success.\n\nIn nature we can actually observe what happens when a species does not have to compete for food anymore: Paradise Birds are the most famous example of this: Living in forests with lots of food and few natural predators their sexual dimorphism gives the male many features that are not only expensive but actually actively bad. Features that would get the male killed once food becomes scarce or predators become more dangerous. Every centimeter of height a male gains during his youth increases his chance of starvation during a famine. Brighter colors make you more prone to being eaten by a predator.\n\nWhile in theory it makes sense for a male to be taller to be able to defend the female this is not something that is relevant anymore: Neither will height help you against a gun, nor in court. Being able to run faster won't make your potatoes grow better. A full beard is not relevant for scientific discovery (although looking at scientists during the last 100 years one could doubt this =D).\n\nIn fact statistics show that countries where polygamy is legal are much less stable than countries that have monogamy. Having young males with no chance of finding a mate (because a mate costs 80 camels) drives them to extreme strategies like becoming warlords, abductions, rape, etc. Apparently monogamy seriously stabilizes societies.\n\nAnd I am not sure if her plans regarding accepting sexually unsuccessful males in our society will work out the way she thinks it will: It's kind of like with cashiers and nurses during Corona. Sure we appreciate you being around. But we don't really appreciate you, we appreciate what you do. And we certainly don't appreciate it enough to pay you fairly or in this case to reward you with sexual affection. Like what is my motivation in creating stuff for others if all it gives me is a thumbs up? Sure it works when I got everything I want, because I have time, but someone who is struggling won't be doing much for others and 80% men will be struggling.\n\nAnd something I also think is relevant: This change is happening after the longst period of peace in human history that I know of (76 years since the end of WWII) and we're already at each others throats sexually. But what will happen in case of a war? It'll be men being conscripted again to die for everyone else. Equal Rights change nothing about this because as a society it is simply dumb to use women for war due to how reproduction works. So women get to choose, get to be protected, ... and 80% of men are still not good enough? There is no way this will not lead to men emigrating to countries where they can play their JBW-card or where their western income makes them a top earner.\n\nAnother experiment with rats showed that rat societies with infinite resources grow large insanely fast, they overpopulate whatever area they're in but at some point it stops. Although resources are there to sustain even more rats all the rats end up doing is eating and cleaning themselves (which has given them the nickname \"The beautiful ones\"). [Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_B._Calhoun#Mouse_experiments). Not only did this lead to a drop in reproductive rate, it actually had such a big influence that the population died out completely: After day 600 not a single birth survived. This experiment has been quoted as a potential fate of man in an age of overpopulation and increasing impersonality of society. Are we possibly seeing the beginnings of this, considering the parallels between \"the beautiful ones\" and Japanese Hikikomori \/ Incels? In theory incels have all the time in the world to create art for others or a career for themselves but that's not usually how they act at all: Instead many of them only sleep, eat, fap and consume media. Anyone else seeing the parallels?\n\n##Discussion  \nSo, what are your thoughts on this? Interesting observation or useless theory? Is this happening right now or is Tinder-Hypergamy just the tip of what's yet to come? How would a mating system look like that is fair to both sides and is it realistic, considering our biological realities? \n\nLooking forward to your opinions =)\n\n**TL;DR**: German biologist says that Marriage is unnatural, that it favors the male imperative, that it makes women unhappy ... but also that it's the reason why our society is great and why we've been able to improve so much culturally and technologically in the last 10k years.","title":"German biologist Meike Stoverock: \"Marriage benefits men; We need to return to female choice\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/mign2s\/german_biologist_meike_stoverock_marriage\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

To put it into perspective, women make up a [minority of murder victims](http:\/\/www.unodc.org\/gsh\/en\/data.html). But would this author argue that because of that, people shouldn't make stories about women being murdered?\n\n>However, it cannot be understated that Ellis--and the other victims in Tamblyn's book--are largely believed. Her male characters, unlike women in real life, largely do not have to go through the painful process of convincing people that they are the victims of sexual assault\n\nI usually try to sound more neutral, but honestly this author's implication that not being believed is a women's issue is completely ludicrous. Male victims in real life also have a hard time convincing people that they were assaulted\n\n - arguably more so than female victims do, since rape is typically perceived (and in many places, legally defined) as something that specifically happens to women\n - much more so if he's also raped by a woman, since it's also a common misconception that men literally can't be raped by women (and in even more places rape is legally defined as the rapist penetrating the victim) or that he wouldn't mind \n - much more than the men in this fictional story. Though I believe part of this is because the assaults in the story are also much more physically violent than typical rapes, therefore easier to prove\n\n>In Tamblyn's fiction, as in reality, the suffering of men takes priority over the suffering of women\n\nWhat alternate reality does she live in where male victims *of anything* are prioritized over female victims, let alone men raped by women compared with women raped by men? Her supporting evidence for this claim is a fictional scenario where a Tweet about female-on-male rape is retweeted more than a Tweet about male-on-female rape\n\nWhich in the first place is fictional, and in the second place wouldn't prove anything. If more attention is ever given to female-on-male rape, it's more likely about sensationalism than concern for men. The same reason female teachers raping male students gets so much attention, but often with headlines like [\"Cops Say 13-Year-Old Boy Traumatized From Endless Sex With Hot Teacher\"](https:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/news\/6198\/cops-say-13-year-old-boy-traumatized-endless-sex-amanda-prestigiacomo) \n\nWhen people like sharing stories about female rapists because they think it's bizarre or **[funny](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/msE06TB)**, this doesn't equate society prioritizing male suffering\n\n>because the story of a female serial rapist doesn't reflect the world we live in\n\n[This](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2011\/oct\/17\/zimbabwe-women-sex-attacks-hitchhiker) is [simply](http:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/woman-40-arrested-for-sex-with-over-100-teen-boys\/) not [true](http:\/\/www.inquisitr.com\/26696\/russian-black-widow-woman-arrested-for-raping-10-men\/#e7pbIAGfrsD3KHjU.99)\n\n>In the final scene of the book, she admits she has no motivation for her crimes: \"It's not revenge. It's not payback. Nothing was done to me. It's just something I like to do now and again.\"\n\nThis is not no motivation. \"...something I like to do\" means she got pleasure out of it; the pleasure could have been sexual and \/ or a power trip, just like this article's author claims male rapists are motivated by\n\nWhy this motivation for the female rapist doesn't satisfy this author makes me think that the author was looking for some deeper explanation. One thing I've appreciated about this book is that it *doesn't* try to give some deep explanation. It doesn't fall back on the rapist having been abused by men or having some psychological illness to try to make her more sympathetic like most media \/ news articles do. She's just a rapist doing it because she gets pleasure from it, the same as any other\n\n>sexual assault harms us all, but it harms women more than others\n\n[No, not necessarily](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/8yne59\/for_the_next_time_someone_tells_you_that_male\/).

(I might wanna add that the pension age change isn't concrete yet, the national council's in favor of it, but it's up to the state council to decide now.)\n\nThe reason they opposite it is because they argue that since women receive a third less state-paid pension than men.

Which is hot garbage.\n\nWhen it comes to the higher pension age for women, I'm still in favor of it for the sake of equality (even though I would've preferred for men's pension age to be lowered to 64 instead...). Their reasoning that women receive too little state-pension should be countered with higher pensions, not by keeping the pension age unequal.

There are also troubling implications for the constitutional requirement of **equal protection** because the laws appear to protect little girls, but not little boys, from religious and culturally motivated surgery.\"\n\n[Arora et al. 2016](https:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/42\/3\/148) wrote in a paper published in *The British Journal of Medical Ethics*:\n\n* \u201cMale circumcision is legal in USA and tolerated in most of the world, even when done by non-medical practitioners in the home. Yet comparable or less radical procedures in women are deemed misogynistic and human rights violations.\u201d\n* \u201c..the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics as well as WHO have labelled all forms of FGA as a human rights violation as it violates \u2018bodily integrity in the absence of any medical benefit\u2019 and victimises vulnerable girls. However, male circumcision is also a procedure that violates bodily integrity and up to recently was thought not to have justifiable medical benefit\u2014but was instead tolerated due to religious and cultural freedom and the lack of long-term harm.\u201d\n\n[Earp 2020](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/341965054_Why_Was_the_US_Ban_on_Female_Genital_Mutilation_Ruled_Unconstitutional_and_What_Does_This_Have_to_Do_With_Male_Circumcision) also noted:\n\n* \u201cThere are now legally prohibited forms of medically unnecessary female genital cutting\u2014including the so-called ritual nick\u2014that are **less severe** than permitted forms of medically unnecessary male and intersex genital cutting.\"\n\nHe also writes about the differences in 'khatna,' which is the genital cutting procedures practiced for both sexes in Islam. The male procedure is more severe and yet completely legal, whereas the female procedure is criminal in all 50 states and treated as a 'mutilation.'\n\n* \u201cThe Bohras practice what they call \u201ckhatna\u201d \u2013 an Arabic word for circumcision \u2013 on both girls and boys within their community...In the female case, \u201ca pinch of skin\u201d is typically cut or removed from the clitoral hood, often leaving no visible sign of alteration. In the male case, the entire penile foreskin is removed, leaving an unmistakably altered sexual organ. According to the ruling by Friedman discussed in the previous section, the less severe female procedure is already illegal in all 50 states\u2014as a criminal assault. It might seem, then, that the more severe male procedure must also be a criminal assault. In fact, that has been a dominant view among legal scholars who have addressed the issue since 1984. However, the male procedure continues to be treated as legal regardless of jurisdiction, including in its more dangerous forms.\u201d\n\nThe double standards don't stop there. There is a procedure that ultra-Orthodox Jews perform called 'metzizah b'peh' which is an ancient, unhygienic form of male circumcision where the \u201cmohel\u201d (traditional circumciser) tears the immature foreskin from the penile glans, typically without pain control, and then takes the baby\u2019s penis into his mouth to staunch the blood and supposedly \u201ccleanse\u201d the wound. This has been known to have caused many cases of herpes and led to two cases of serious brain damage and two deaths in one year alone. Not only is this practice not treated as illegal\u2014it isn\u2019t even regulated. City officials ultimately dropped even an informal plan to require that parents sign a consent [form](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/09\/10\/nyregion\/new-york-city-health-board-repeals-rule-on-consent-forms-for-circumcision-ritual.html).\n\nHowever, any forms of female genital cutting, including ones done in sterilized and anesthetized manners are seen as illegal and criminal, **full stop**.\n\nNow, some might respond with something to the degree of: \"Circumcision has health benefits whereas FGM has none.\"\n\nWell, the question I would ask is: \"If it was demonstrated that FGM had health benefits, would you concede your position that it is a moral wrong?\" Presumably not, and this is merely a moral red herring. If so, then you might have to be prepared to give up your view, as some health benefits have also been noted for FGM in many scholarly sources.\n\nFor example, there has been found: \"a lower risk of vaginal cancer \u2026 fewer infections from microbes gathering under the hood of the clitoris, and protection against herpes and genital ulcers.\u201d - [Source 1](https:\/\/anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1525\/maq.2007.21.3.301), [Source 2](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/276160197_Female_genital_mutilation_and_male_circumcision_toward_an_autonomy-based_ethical_framework)\n\nMoreover, at least [two studies](http:\/\/scholarworks.gsu.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=iph_theses) by Western scientists [have shown](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worse) a negative correlation between female genital cutting and HIV. The authors of one of the studies, both seasoned statisticians who expected to find the opposite relationship, described their findings as a \u201csignificant and perplexing inverse association between reported female circumcision and HIV seropositivity.\u201d\n\nAgain, no one would ever consider making FGM legal on the basis of these potential, prophylactic health benefits.\n\nI would also like to bring to your attention something known as \u2018cosmetic\u2019 female genital cutting, which typically consists of medically unnecessary procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other alterations to the female genital organs for perceived cosmesis\u2014widely practiced in Western countries and generally considered acceptable if performed with the informed consent of the individual. These consist of the **same** procedures that are typically classified as FGM.\n\nGiven that there is overlap (or a close anatomical parallel) between each form of WHO-de\ufb01ned \u2018mutilation\u2019 and Western- style \u2018cosmetic\u2019 female genital cutting, neither of which is medically necessary, one must ask what the widely perceived categorical moral difference is between these two sets of procedures. Controlling for clinical context varies across the two sets and is often functionally similar\u2014the most promising candidate for such a difference appears to be the **typical age**, and hence **presumed** **or likely consent-status**, of the subject. But if that is correct, it is not ultimately the degree of invasiveness (which ranges widely across both sets of practices), speci\ufb01c tissues affected, or the precise medical or non-medical bene\ufb01t- to-risk pro\ufb01le of medically unnecessary (female) genital cutting that is most central to determining its perceived moral acceptability. Rather, it is the extent to which the affected individual desires the genital cutting and can consent to it. This suggests that the core of the putative rights violation is the **lack of consent** regarding a medically unnecessary intervention into one\u2019s sexual anatomy. This consideration applies regardless of the sex or gender of the non-consenting person.\n\nThere is a clear double standard between the two procedures. This is clearly an issue involving feminism and MRA because if we are protecting little girls from a harmful procedure but doing millions of them on little boys, then this must be framed in the context of gender discrimination and how we view human rights violations when they are done to the respective sexes.","title":"Double Standards between Circumcision and FGM","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/lnk3hf\/double_standards_between_circumcision_and_fgm\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

Examples of such can be viewed here:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/6m9b5y\/why\\_do\\_female\\_rapists\\_spend\\_less\\_time\\_in\\_prison\/djzy7nr\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/6m9b5y\/why_do_female_rapists_spend_less_time_in_prison\/djzy7nr\/)\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/6m7zgk\/why\\_isnt\\_women\\_are\\_wonderful\\_effect\\_more\\_talked\/dk0xjhg\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/6m7zgk\/why_isnt_women_are_wonderful_effect_more_talked\/dk0xjhg\/)\n\n[https:\/\/archive.is\/VpOIy#selection-497.0-508.0](https:\/\/archive.is\/VpOIy#selection-497.0-508.0)\n\n[http:\/\/archive.is\/ufw77#selection-1715.0-1715.88](http:\/\/archive.is\/ufw77#selection-1715.0-1715.88)\n\nI completely reject this, however, for a multitude of reasons.\n\n1: This is one way that men's issues are often dismissed. Someone brings up some of the important issues that men face, and feminists respond by saying that it's part of patriarchy and represents the costs that come from male dominance. This way, eventually, these issues never get solved.\n\n2: Hostile sexism is generally worse than benevolent sexism. For example, a FinallyFeminism101 [FAQ](https:\/\/archive.is\/Dak2v#selection-607.0-647.493)  states that male disposability is the result of misogyny because women are being put into \"cages.\" Similarly, the subreddit r\/AskFeminists has [argued](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskFeminists\/comments\/6m7zgk\/why_isnt_women_are_wonderful_effect_more_talked\/dk0xjhg\/) that the draft is a result of sexism against women because women are seen as incapable, which is why they're not allowed in the draft. However, the primary victims of the U.S. draft in the 1960s and 70s were clearly the 2.2 million men forced into the military, not the women at home who felt insulted by the message it sent about them being incapable. It is definitely a valid concern, but the primary victims of the gender injustice here are men. Likewise, if someone tells you that your life is less valuable than someone else's, you don't say: 'Well, gee, thanks! I was worried that you were going to box me in a cage!'\n\n3: We could also apply the same logic surrounding some of these responses to dismiss important women's issues. Examples:\n\n**Pay Gap**:\n\n\"Women make less money than men because we don\u2019t see men as having worth outside of providing money to others, and so we encourage men to work longer hours, take longer commutes, set aside their passions, etc. It's just benevolent sexism against men.\"\n\n**Slut-shaming:**\n\n\"Slut-shaming happens to women because men\u2019s sexuality is seen as dirty and demeaning to them. That's what MRA's are trying to fight against.\"\n\n**Women being forced to wear Hijabs:**\n\n\"Women are expected to cover up in places of Saudi Arabia because of the idea that men don\u2019t have any self-control. Fix the misandry, and it\u2019ll help women.\"\n\n**Child-care:**\n\n\"The reason we expect women to care for children is that we don\u2019t trust men doing it. Women suffer the consequences of misandry too, you know.\"\n\nEtc.\n\nIf hostile sexism towards men results in benevolent sexism towards women, then hostile sexism towards women results in benevolent sexism against men. By this dichotomy that feminists have set up, sexism impacts women and men equally.\n\nThis can be best described through [Ozy\u2019s Law](http:\/\/archive.is\/hTVtZ#selection-2213.67-2219.43):\n\n**It is impossible to form a stereotype about either of the two primary genders without simultaneously forming a concurrent and complementary stereotype about the other. Or, more simply: Misandry mirrors misogyny.**\n\nAnyways, these are just some of my thoughts.

Almost no one has even heard of this case, mainly because it is such a normal occurrence that it doesn't stand out.\n\nI think these facts make people who decry 'rape culture' look disingenuous, and while many feminists claim that male rape should be taken seriously, I don't see it in practice.\n\nSo my question for debate is: Does the Brock Turner case prove or disprove the idea that we live in a 'rape culture'.","title":"If we live in a rape culture, where are the rallies in support of Brock Turner?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4nlj0a\/if_we_live_in_a_rape_culture_where_are_the\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

When ever male gender roles are talked about, it's always talked about as if only men play a role in maintaining them and not women. And while men do have a greater role, just like women have large role in maintaining their gender roles, the role women play isn't insignificant.\n\nA good example of this, in my opinion, is dating. Many women often complain about unwanted attention from men, especially those who keep hitting on them and being very forward with them. But there's a reason why so many men are like that and the reason is that, it does work. Or at least more than other methods. Dating, for men, is largely a numbers game, unless you happen to be very attractive you're not exactly going to get a lot of offers so you have to keep putting yourself out there until you eventually strike gold. This could be remedied by women putting themselves out there more instead of relying on men to be the initiators.\n\nMany men have testified on how they have to modify their behavior and act in a masculine fashion otherwise they will be ignored by women at best, or treated with disgust by them at worst. Many people on this sub have talked about this being a reason why traditional masculinity is still around. On the subreddit r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates, which I frequent, I've seen a few posts regarding how a lot of men are forced to be stereo-typically stoic because if they don't fulfill their role as \"the rock\" in the relationship, and show their vulnerabilities, many women act with disgust forcing them to conform.\n\nThis, to me, is one of the major reasons why male gender roles have stagnated in relation to women's, because a lot of people don't want to address the contribution that women make towards men's gender roles. I'd like to ask\/ debate the sub about this and what should be done to help liberate men for their gender role with the focus on how both men and women can contribute to it, not just men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/mg430u\/hidden\\_propagators\\_of\\_harmful\\_gender\\_norms\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/mg430u\/hidden_propagators_of_harmful_gender_norms\/)\n\nLink: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/mp597r\/does\\_the\\_whole\\_emotional\\_labor\\_argument\\_seem\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/mp597r\/does_the_whole_emotional_labor_argument_seem\/)\n\nLink: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/i97xos\/womens\\_toxic\\_expectations\\_and\\_standards\\_for\\_men\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/i97xos\/womens_toxic_expectations_and_standards_for_men\/)","title":"Why male gender roles have stagnated and what to do about it.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/mrhuut\/why_male_gender_roles_have_stagnated_and_what_to\/","upvote_ratio":0.95,"over_18":false}

It infantilizes women. Punching up comes across to me as pretty much saying that women should be allowed to say things to others without having to expect consequences of self-reflection because they cannot control their emotions, because often, when somebody uses the excuse of \"they're punching up\", they're also saying \"they're punching up because they're angry at \\[men \/ patriarchy\\] who hurt them in the past\". In progressive circles, men expressing anger irrationally (by lashing out at others, using blanket statements of entire groups of people, etc.) is already heavily discouraged, so why do we encourage women to do? It kind of sounds like as if one is talking about a child throwing a tantrum, \"let them vent their anger, they can't control themselves, they're just a kid\"\n2. It paints women as weak and unable to harm anybody. Because, you know, when some women call for the deaths of entire demographics, they're not to be taken seriously because unlike those evil men, women are actually harmless. And before you tell me that \"but women don't actually go out killing men when they say \"kill all men\", that never happens, unlike when men say \"kill all women\", they actually go out killing women\"  \nMen already make up [almost 79% of global homicide victims](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homicide_statistics_by_genderhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homicide_statistics_by_gender) (usually killed by other men), so saying \"kill all men\" seems pretty insensitive, since men are already the majority of people being murdered. Do we really have to wait until women also start murdering men at similar rates as other men before we can talk about \"kill all men\"?\n3. It's just another way to tell men that they should just \"suck it up\". They're essentially expecting men to once again take the role of the strong man: the one who doesn't feel threatened by gross generalizations and threats of death ; the one who is supposed to be willing to take one for the team and not feel anything so women get to vent free of consequence and self-reflection ; the one who knows that they are actually invulnerable to verbal abuse. They are literally promoting toxic masculinity with this phrase, without even realizing it.  \nLook, I know what it is like to be socialized into the belief that the only thing that matters is physical threat: that we can be safe if we can just be strong; that we can conquer the world and be secure; that our emotional wounds don't matter. I know the idea, more than that, the ideology, that \"a poor man feeling sad\" is a joke, an irrelevance, something no real man would ever stoop to. \"What wimps, what pathetic losers, what pussies\" - I know that thought, I have that thought, I have heard that thought, I hate that thought.  \n\"Sticks and stones\" or whatever. But that proverb is garbage anyways.\n\n# If punching people is bad, it's bad no matter who you're punching.

She was critical of second wave feminism, including how it dealt with and treated men. So she helped create third wave feminism, which is modern mainstream feminism.\n\n\nThese are some excerpts from the introduction to *The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love* published in 2004.\n\n\n>The male bashing that was so intense when contemporary feminism first surfaced more than thirty years ago was in part the rageful coverup of the shame women felt not because men refused to share their power but because we could not seduce, cajole, or entice men to share their emotions to love us.\n\n>By claiming that they wanted the power men had, man-hating feminists (who were by no means the majority) covertly proclaimed that they too wanted to be rewarded for being out of touch with their feelings, for being unable to love. Men in patriarchal culture responded to feminist demand for greater equity in the work world and in the sexual world by making room, by sharing the spheres of power. The place where most men refused to change--believed themselves unable to change--was in their emotional lives. Not even for the love and respect of liberated women were men willing to come to the table of love as equal partners ready to share the feast.\n\n[...]\n\n>Rather than bringing us great wisdom about the nature of men and love, reformist feminist focus on male power reinforced the notion that somehow males were powerful and had it all. Feminist writing did not tell us about the deep inner misery of men. It did not tell us the terrible terror that gnaws at the soul when one cannot love. Women who envied men their hardheartedness were not about to tell us the depth of male suffering. And so it has taken more than thirty years for the voices of visionary feminists to be heard telling the world the truth about men and love. Barbara Deming hinted at those truths:\n\"I think the reason that men are so very violent is that they know, deep in themselves, that they're acting out a lie, and so they're furious at being caught up in the lie. But they don't know how to break\nit....They're in a rage because they are acting out a lie which means that in some deep part of themselves they want to be delivered from it, are homesick for the truth.\"\n\n>The truth we do not tell is that men are longing for love. This is the longing feminist thinkers must dare to examine, explore, and talk about. Those rare visionary feminist seers, who are now no longer all female, are no longer afraid to openly address issues of men, masculinity, and love. Women have been joined by men with open minds and big hearts, men who love, men who know how hard it is for males to practice the art of loving in patriarchal culture. \n\n[...]\n\n>The unhappiness of men in relationships, the grief men feel about the failure of love, often goes unnoticed in our society precisely because the patriarchal culture really does not care if men are unhappy. When females are in emotional pain, the sexist thinking that says that emotions should and can matter to women makes it possible for most of us to at least voice our heart, to speak it to someone, whether a close friend, a therapist, or the stranger sitting next to us on a plane or bus. Patriarchal mores teach a form of emotional stoicism to men that says they are more manly if they do not feel, but if by chance they should feel and the feelings hurt, the manly response is to stuff them down, to forget about them, to hope they go away. George Weinberg explains in Why Men Won't Commit: Most men are on quest for the readymade perfect woman because they basically feel that problems in a relationship cant be worked out. When the slightest thing goes wrong, it seems easier to bolt than talk.\u201d The masculine pretense is that real men feel no pain,\nThe reality is that men are hurting and that the whole culture responds to them by saying, Please do not tell us what you feel.\u201d","title":"Bell hooks, a leader of 3rd wave feminism: \"The reality is that men are hurting and that the whole culture responds to them by saying, 'please do not tell us what you feel.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2thnac\/bell_hooks_a_leader_of_3rd_wave_feminism_the\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

If you don't want this to happen, men's advocates are banned from enough spaces that you can mostly avoid them. If you're upset by them, it's because you're consciously making decisions to look at their content or engage with them.\n\nThis is not true of feminism. Feminism informs so much policy in education and work that you really need to make some very incredible life decisions to avoid it. It even impacts things like what Google and YouTube give you in the search results. Twitter used to ban this kind of dissident thought and so now men's advocates have to basically start over with fewer followers. It's hard to avoid.\n\nBecause feminism is backed by power, feminists can speak freely without any real consequences for their social media getting banned or from being branded a sexist at work. A feminist can make very stupid talking points without facing the same social consequence of a dissident who makes very stupid talking points. Depending on the setting, they may not even get challenged. \n\nA feminist can make it as a public intellectual without any real understanding of what men's advocates talk about and without ever engaging with the opposition. Papers can be published and taught in university without even acknowledging the asston of criticism it receives from men's advocates. These papers will even be taught in GedEd classes at university, that you basically have to take if you're gonna be an educated person. \n\nBecause powerful people support feminism, it can be treated as objectively true. A feminist perspective on someone who was active in gamergate or speaks about topics like inceldom or gender realism can be reported in major media as fact and that leads to things like how someone's Wikipedia page might be written or how the world understands them. This can all be done without the consent of the person being written about. \n\nWhether someone individual is a good feminist, a bad feminist, a smart feminist, or a dumb feminist is not really what matters to its critics, because it's critics cannot avoid the fact that feminism from a wide spectrum of quality or intelligence will impact their lives whether they like it to or not. \n\nFor this reason, an individual feminist will often be annoyed that feminism is often criticized the way policy and power are criticized, rather than how an idea may be criticized. An idea is generally criticized in its best or truest version, but most critics of feminism are criticizing the ways in which feminism wields power over them in their day to day life. \n\nFor this reason, \"good feminism\" can sometimes be seen as a Motte and Bailey to avoid talking about actual policy and the things that matter. To some men's advocates, feminism can seem to take two forms: (a) things that power inflicts upon us, and (b) a head in the clouds discussion to distract from things power inflicts upon us. This causes a lot of men to just hate it.","title":"Most of the reason feminism gets so much hate is because feminism is backed by power.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/13z0vpc\/most_of_the_reason_feminism_gets_so_much_hate_is\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

In contrast to the \u201cwomen are wonderful\u201d effect (Eagly et al. 1991), contemporary men are subject to a \u201cmen are toxic\u201d effect. The notion of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d has emerged and has even gained widespread credence despite the lack of any empirical testing (see chapter on masculinity by Seager and Barry). In general terms it appears as if attitudes to men have been based on generalisations made from the most damaged and extreme individual males.\n\n>There is a serious risk arising from using terms such as \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. Unlike \u201cmale depression\u201d, which helps identify a set of symptoms that can be alleviated with therapy, the term \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d has no clinical value. In fact it is an example of another cognitive distortion called labelling (Yurica et al. 2005). Negative labelling and terminology usually have a negative impact, including self-fulflling prophecies and alienation of the groups who are being labelled. We wouldn\u2019t use the term \u201ctoxic\u201d to describe any other human demographic. Such a term would be unthinkable with reference to age, disability, ethnicity or religion. The same principle of respect must surely apply to the male gender. It is likely therefore that developing a more realistic and positive narrative about masculinity in our culture will be a good thing for everyone.\n\n\nNow that's not all. A pilot study conducted found that over 80% of people surveyed found the term unhelpful and likely to be harmful to men. \n\nhttps:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/3871217#.X4c7q9BKiUk\n\nfeminists are right: words matter. Just like we moved away from policeman, salesman, chairman to stop signaling to girls that these jobs are not for them we should be careful of the language we use when talking about ideas as to not signal to men that their identity as men is toxic.\n\nOr in other words:\n\nIf your first response to someone learning about the name of your position is \"No, you're not understanding the name correctly\" ... then maybe you should rename it.\n\nlabeling a problem you see as \"toxic masculinity\" when it is a problem originating from men and women is inherently going to isolate men. If the problem was called \"toxic feminine need\" due to the expectation of women about masculine actions, women would likely react negatively just because of the terminology.\n\nAnd given that many actually use toxic masculinity to mean that men are toxic, and many men feel insulted by the use of toxic masculinity, how about we keep the general idea and concepts, but instead relabel it toxic male gender roles, so it's the expectations we place on men that are toxic, instead of masculinity itself?\n\nThe vast majority of people don't think that there are multiple different varieties of masculinity, Or that masculinity is simply the roles placed on men by society. They simply think that masculinity is that which makes a man a man, and if toxic masculinity is a thing, it means that that which makes a man a man is toxic.\n\nInstead of doubling down on using a word that people don't understand and feel offended by, as though using the \"correct terminology\" is more important than actually addressing the problem, why don't we just change how we call it, so we can stop antagonizing men and get down to actually dealing with the issues, rather than fighting about how we call it and alienating men in the process?","title":"We need to stop labeling men and masculinity as toxic.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/jog1mc\/we_need_to_stop_labeling_men_and_masculinity_as\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

Specifically, I'm taking issue with the following bit:\n\n>Christopher Johnson, executive director of the Rape and Abuse Crisis Center of Fargo Moorhead, said men feel as if their masculinity is threatened if they say they\u2019ve been victimized.\n\nWhy is it that when we talk about women and female gender norms, we talk about women being pressured to conform to those norms, but when we talk about the same process in men, we talk about it like it's an act of cowardice? Is that not\u2014ironically\u2014an expression (and reinforcement) of male gender norms?\n\nIt seems to me this approach to men's issues is particularly popular among feminists, and specifically seems to be the crux of Michael Kimmel's views on the topic. With women, we talk about having to liberate them from the toxic societal norms imposed upon them, but with men, it's that masculinity itself is toxic, needs to change, and that men need to be helped to do so. Women get language about liberation and oppression, while men get language about how toxic their gender identity itself is. Women suffer from problems, men *are* problems.\n\nI have no doubt that Michael Kimmel would say I'm splitting hairs and perhaps even deliberately misunderstanding his point, but I would counter that he is failing to understand mine. This may be \"just semantics,\" but semantics are actually quite important. In very subtle ways, they have huge impact on societal thinking, and thereby on societal prejudices. To me, this double-standard reeks of anti-male sexism. \n\nAnother\u2014admittedly milder\u2014example to me, is the idea that men are raised in ways that prevent them from feeling, being in touch with, or expressing certain feelings\u2014like pain, depression, fear, etc. I disagree with this, because I see men expressing these feelings all the time\u2014they just tend to do it in different ways than women. I think what's really going on is that men are raised to solve their own problems and not ask for help. It's not that being victimized threatens a man's gender identity\u2014it's failing to overcome it without assistance that threatens it. \n\nBut when we talk about how women aren't as assertive as men in pay negotiations, do we talk how women don't stand up for themselves, because it's a threat to their femininity? No, we talk about how women are raised to be passive and compliant and how unjust and oppressive that is, and consider banning salary negotiations, because clearly it's society that needs to change, not women. Do we talk about how they're not in touch with their feelings of self-confidence or can't express it, like women are somehow psychologically limited by their gender norms? No, we don't.\n\nThoughts? Do others perceive the distinctions I'm seeing here and see it as a form of sexism?","title":"Sexism in language regarding male vs. female issues.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4g8e8i\/sexism_in_language_regarding_male_vs_female_issues\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

People tend to take offense to stereotyping and sexist claims\n\n>But if someone mentions the undisputable fact that men kill, rape and assault women on a horrific scale every day in every part of the world and have done for all of human existence \n\nThis is an emotionally-charged, misleading, and meaningless statement. To say it's a fact that \"men\" do these things (without specifying which \"men\") is deceptive. If she means men in general, then she's wrong. Men in general do not to this and most are appalled by violence against women\n\nIf she means specific mean, then the statement is meaningless. In that case it's also an indisputable fact that women kill, rape, and assault men in every part of the world. \"On a horrific scale\" is another meaningless thing. All murder, rape, and assault is horrific, so any amount is a horrific scale. If she just means \"a lot\", then again, the same can be said about women [raping](https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/life-style\/female-sex-offenders-more-common-gender-bias-statistics-rape-abuse-a7839361.html) and [assaulting](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1854883\/) and [murdering](http:\/\/archive.is\/MQvgk) men\n\n>This is a breathtakingly selfish response. By diving into a discussion about gendered violence and saying \"not all men\", you are preventing a useful and necessary conversation from happening because it hurts your feelings. \n\nIt's breathtakingly selfish towards male victims and female perpetrators to treat assault and rape as \"gendered\" because acknowledging the former hurts a her narrative\n\n>they're all determined to redirect the conversation away from anything that might force them to think about their own behaviour. \n\nExcept it isn't their own behavior that's the issue. The issue is the behavior of abusers, of which many are female, and of which the vast majority of men are not in any way responsible for. It would be just as accurate to say \"mothers abuse and murder their children on a horrific scale every day and in every part of the world. Saying 'not all mothers' is selfish. Instead, all you mothers need to take responsibility for the behavior of violence towards children\"\n\n>If it's true that very few men do bad things to women, women wouldn't be trained from a young age to avoid dark alleyways, to keep an eye on our drinks, to jam our keys between our fingers as we walk to our cars. \n\nThat's like saying \"if it were true that very few adults kidnap random children from the street, Stranger Danger wouldn't exist.\" Paranoia breeds the idea that these things are extremely common, not the other way around\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRealistically, a man is more likely to be attacked or murdered by strangers than a woman is. Realistically, either an adult or child is more likely to be abused by someone it knows than a stranger. Despite these realities, parents scorn men with cameras in parks, meanwhile never suspecting relatives, babysitters, and teachers. Despite these realities, women are taught that they should be constantly afraid of a strange man jumping out of the darkness to attack her. And despite these realities, men are taught that they're invincible and don't have to worry about being attacked like women do\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that women are taught to fear danger far more than men are only proves that society is more concerned about women being attacked. It doesn't in itself prove that there is actually more danger for women\n\n>There's a simple reason why women fear men. The average man could easily overpower most women if he wanted to. \n\nAlso, an average woman can easily overpower a child if she wanted to. An average person can easily stab someone in the neck from behind if it wanted to. An average woman can easily ruin a man's life with false accusations if she wanted to. By her logic, everyone should fear everyone\n\n>Incidents of female-on-male violence are no less serious than the other way around, but they're so rare that they become news events like Lorena Bobbitt or Sharon Edwards. \n\n[They're not rare at all](https:\/\/culturalanalysis.net\/2018\/03\/18\/dividing-the-sexes-domestic-violence-statistics-in-australia\/). That's just an ignorant thing to say. Not only is female-on-male violence likely at least just as prevalent as vice versa, but when a man is the victim of such violence, he [can't rely on the police as much as female victims can](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/uknews\/crime\/12061547\/How-male-victims-of-domestic-abuse-often-end-up-getting-arrested-themselves.html), nor is it always socially acceptable for him to defend himself. So not only do incidents of it happen, but with practically no resources for male victims to turn to, it's a systemic issue, as well\n\n>When our lives are on the line, you all look the same. And quite frankly, I don't care if that hurts your feelings. \n\nAnd yet she expects men to care about and pander to her feelings of fear and paranoia. She only deserves as much consideration as she gives.

If she cheated, she has a strong incentive to lie. While most people don\u2019t cheat, we still have prenups. And even though there\u2019s social pushback against requesting one, they exist for a reason.  \n\nSome argue that biology isn\u2019t what makes someone a parent, pointing to happy adoptive families. That\u2019s true, but irrelevant\u2014adoptive parents *choose* that arrangement with full knowledge. Just like open relationships, various parenting dynamics exist as options. But the overwhelming majority choose monogamy, and most people would only want to raise their biological children. Consent requires *informed* agreement. Without it, a situation changes entirely\u2014just like how sex without informed consent becomes rape.  \n\nThis principle is debated in other contexts, but in ways that often devalue men\u2019s consent. Take the debate over trans disclosure\u2014it\u2019s almost always framed around protecting trans women from men, not about whether men should have the right to informed choice. Even in rare cases where trans men have raped women, media reports often obscure male perpetratorship by labeling it as 'woman rapes woman.'\n\nThe same applies to paternity uncertainty. We expect men to take on the role of provider and protector, just as we historically expected them to risk their lives for women and children. Their consent is not even secondary\u2014it\u2019s simply assumed. But if we demand that fathers step up for their children, why allow them to do so under false pretenses? Why leave paternity uncertainty on the table at all?\n\n**Edit\/Clarification**:  \nTo be clear, I\u2019m not advocating for mandatory testing or debating who should pay for it. The idea is to make paternity testing a *normalized, standard option* at birth, with results given in a sealed envelope for the stated father to open or not. This would reduce the stigma and negative reactions that often come with requesting a test later. It\u2019s about creating a culture where paternity testing isn\u2019t seen as an accusation but as a routine part of ensuring informed consent.  \n\nThe focus here is on the *principle* of informed consent and reducing the social friction around paternity testing, not on logistics or enforcement.  \n\n\nThe majority of responses are about it not trusting women (look up the fable of Bluebeard for my counter), cost (which isnt a real argument in any way as costs can be managed), or how you cant force medical tests (the same arguments ant vax people use). So as these are not compelling or even as i see it vaild arguments how would you try to justify them if you do agree or what better arguments would you make?","title":"Why the hate for adding paternity tests as standard to birth?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1jdd56m\/why_the_hate_for_adding_paternity_tests_as\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

It makes me confused, scared and angry when I think about it. This came up the the comments of an [unrelated post](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/oqymuy\/what_are_your_opinions_of_the_rise_of_superhero\/h6fgfx6) but I don't think many people are still reading those threads so I wanted to give this its own post.\n\nHere's the Wikipedia article for anyone who has no idea what I'm talking about:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber\n\nJames Damore was an engineer at Google. He attended a diversity seminar which asked for feedback. He gave his feedback in the form of a memo titled \"Google\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\"\n\nThis memo discussed how differences in representation of men and women at Google are not necessarily due to sexism. He discussed some of the differences between men and women at a population level and how they might produce the different outcomes seen. He then went on to suggest changes which might increase the representation of women without discriminating against men.\n\nI'm somewhat unclear on how widely he distributed his memo but at some point other people, who took issue with it, shared it with everyone at Google and then the media. \n\nIt was presented by the media as an \"anti-diversity screed\" and it seems that the vast majority of people who heard about his memo accepted the media narrative. It's often asserted that he argued that his female coworkers were too neurotic to work at Google.\n\nThe memo is not hard to find online but the first result you are likely to encounter stripped all of the links from the document which removed some of the context, including the definition of \"neuroticism\" he was using, which makes it clear that he is using the term from psychology and another link showing that his claim that women on average report higher neuroticism had scientific support.\n\nEven with this version, you can still see that Damore acknowledges that women face sexism and makes it very clear he is talking about population level trends, not making generalisations about all women. It seems that most people have based their opinions of the memo on out-of-context quotes.\n\nHere is the memo with the links he included:\n\nhttps:\/\/s3.documentcloud.org\/documents\/3914586\/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf\n\nHere is the part people take issue with in context:\n\n> **Possible non-bias causes of the gender gap in tech\u200b**\n\n> At Google, we\u2019re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women \nback in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the \nworkplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it\u2019s far from the whole story. \n \n> On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren\u2019t just \nsocially constructed because: \n\n> * They\u2019re universal across human cultures \n> * They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone \n> * Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify  \nand act like males \n> * The underlying traits are highly heritable \n> * They\u2019re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective \n\n> Note, I\u2019m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these \ndifferences are \u201cjust.\u201d I\u2019m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men \nand women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why \nwe don\u2019t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences \nare small and there\u2019s significant overlap between men and women, so you can\u2019t say anything \nabout an individual given these population level distributions.\n\n[<graph sketches illustrating the above point>](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9dhMovs.png)\n\n> **Personality differences**\n\n> [Women, on average, have more\u200b:](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sex_differences_in_psychology#Personality_traits)\n \n> * Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally \nalso have a stronger interest in \u200b[people rather than things](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x)\u200b, relative to men (also \ninterpreted as \u200b[empathizing vs. systemizing\u200b](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory)). \n\n> These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social \nor \u200bartistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even \nwithin SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both \npeople and aesthetics. \n\n> * Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness. Also, higher \nagreeableness. \n\n> This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for \nraises, speaking up, and leading. Note that these are just average differences \nand there\u2019s overlap between men and women, but this is seen solely as a \nwomen\u2019s issue. This leads to exclusory programs like Stretch and swaths of men \nwithout support. \n\n> * [Neuroticism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neuroticism)\u200b \u200b(higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance). \n\n> This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist \nand to the lower number of women in high stress jobs. \n\nHe starts by acknowledging that women do face sexism.\n\n> At Google, we\u2019re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women \nback in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the \nworkplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it\u2019s far from the whole story.\n\nHe then makes it totally clear he's not making generalisations about all women.\n\n> Note, I\u2019m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these \ndifferences are \u201cjust.\u201d I\u2019m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men \nand women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why \nwe don\u2019t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. **Many of these differences \nare small and there\u2019s significant overlap between men and women, so you can\u2019t say anything \nabout an individual given these population level distributions**.\n\nThe word \"Neuroticism\" in the memo was a hyperlink to the Wikipedia article defining the term:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neuroticism\n\n> Not to be confused with Neurosis.\n\n> In the study of psychology, neuroticism has been considered a fundamental personality trait. For example, in the Big Five approach to personality trait theory, \n\n\"Women, on average, have more\u200b\" is also a hyperlink to a Wikipedia article (with citations) backing up his claims:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sex_differences_in_psychology#Personality_traits\n\n> Cross-cultural research has shown population-level gender differences on the tests measuring sociability and emotionality. **For example, on the scales measured by the Big Five personality traits women consistently report higher neuroticism, agreeableness, warmth and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness and openness to ideas**. Nevertheless, there is significant overlap in all these traits, so an individual woman may, for example, have lower neuroticism than the majority of men.\n\nI accept that the point he was making contradicts the deeply held beliefs of some people. I respect their right to argue that he was wrong, both morally and factually. I respect their right to argue that was so wrong that he deserved consequences. I disagree with them but they have every right to make that case.\n\nWhat troubles me is that they didn't make that case. They didn't confront Damore's argument. They deliberately misrepresented it. They had access to the original document. They must have read it to be upset by it. They knew what it actually said and they lied about it. This was not just the people who leaked it out of Google. It was the media, journalists whose job it is to present the truth. Sure we expect them to introduce their own bias but that's meant to be in how they spin the truth, not through outright lies.\n\nThey set out to destroy someone for saying something they didn't like but they obviously had the clarity to recognise that average people would find Damore's actual argument totally benign. Most people can acknowledge that, at a population level, men and women have different temperaments and preferences. That this might lead to different outcomes, again at the population level, is not an idea which it outside the Overton window. So, rather than denounce his actual arguments, they accused him of something they knew people would get angry at, sexism against women. \n\nThe most troubling part is that it worked. People accepted the lie. Even when they had access to the actual memo, which explicitly denounces the position he is accused of taking, they accepted the misinformation.","title":"James Damore's memo and its misrepresentation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/owwppt\/james_damores_memo_and_its_misrepresentation\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

And women are the ones who suffer the most from them.\n\nI want to again reiterate that \"toxic femininity\" as it is commonly used is not implying that all femininity is toxic. That being said, if someone did say \"femininity itself is toxic\", is that really a horrible or misogynist thing to say?

Every feminist organization is either in favor of male circumcision openly, or closeted.

The analogy works like this:\n\nImagine that abortions are completely legal but everyone who gets an abortion has to pay an Abortion Tax. The tax is scaled to income (like child support) and is paid monthly for 18 years (like child support) and goes into the foster system, to support children (like child support).\n\nThe response to this is usually that such a tax would be a gross violation of women's rights. But in fact it would put women in exactly the same position as men currently are: they have complete bodily autonomy to avoid being pregnant, but they can't avoid other, purely financial, consequences of unwanted pregnancy.\n\nAnyone agreeing that forcing female victims of rape or reproductive coercion to pay an abortion tax is wrong, should also agree that forcing male victims to pay child support is wrong.","title":"The Abortion Tax Analogy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/ppuz0t\/the_abortion_tax_analogy\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

Someone who is depressed they have a man's body is recognized as an oppressed soul in need of help, but someone who is depressed they have a short body is told they should just learn to love their body as it is, and that surgery won't solve their problems, that the real problem is their personality etc.\n\nWhy is gender dysphoria treated so differently to other forms of body dysphoria?","title":"Why is gender dysphoria treated so differently to other forms of body dysphoria?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/nkatto\/why_is_gender_dysphoria_treated_so_differently_to\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

Of the last 10 international competitions she participated in she won gold in 6 and silver in 1, and withdrew from 2 due to an injury (while being at the top in one, unranked in the other).\n\nI'm of the opinion that she shouldn't be allowed to compete with people born female since she has gone through male puberty, benefitting from the permanent changes to the body that occur during male puberty, such as an increase in bone and muscle density. Should she want to, she should be allowed to compete with men, but she would certainly be at a disadvantage if she's taking hormone inhibitors at the moment. Her being at a disadvantage or it being unfair towards her is preferrable to every other competitor being at a disadvantage or it being unfair towards them.\n\nA third possibility would be the creation of a transgender competition (one for MtF and one for FtM) but I doubt there would be enough participants, and I don't think creating an incentive for athletes who are falling behind compared to their peers to become trans in order to keep competing would be a positive thing.\n\nWeird\/irrelevant trivia: she's the 2nd olympian (future olympian in her case) to come out as transgender, and like her predecessor (Caitlyn Jenner) was also involved in a serious car crash, in Hubbard's case 'only' leading to severe spinal injuries for the victim (Jenner's was fatal).\n\nPS: Not sure if this should be News or Media or Legal, went with News since it's coming from a news outlet I guess.","title":"Females told to \u2018be quiet\u2019 on transgender issue - female ex-weightlifter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/n7u35m\/females_told_to_be_quiet_on_transgender_issue\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

The authors also had access only to American data, and the health care system there is very different than we have here in Canada. But the findings do build on studies that show differences in practice patterns between male and female doctors. Prior research has shown that female doctors are more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines, provide preventive care more often and use more patient-centred communication.\n\n[MSN - Are female doctors better than male doctors?](http:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-ca\/health\/wellness\/are-female-doctors-better-than-male-doctors\/ar-BBC6I5V?li=AAggV0S&srcref=rss)\n\nIn fact, another MSN backed site used this data to state this:\n\n> If you're wondering who to choose as your child's pediatrician, **you may want to go beyond just getting a recommendation from a friend and consider hiring a recommended female physician.** According to Harvard researchers, patients receiving treatment from a female doctor were four percent less likely to die and five percent less likely to be re-admitted to the hospital than patients who were treated by male physicians. Those percentages may not seem noteworthy, but they translate into 32,000 patients who stay alive and out of the hospital per year.

It might be that they wouldn't start conscripting women if they were more involved in international conflicts, so more risk and danger. On the other hands, there are countries that utilize female soldiers in dangerous situations, so that might not be the case.\n\n> That includes looking at how Norway is logistically handling the transformation. B\u00f8e\u2019s staff is now sending conscription letters to all 63,000 Norwegian 17-year-olds, inviting them to complete an online questionnaire. Based on the results, the armed forces will invite 20,000 boys and girls for interviews as well as physical and psychological tests; of them, it will select 10,000 to train as soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s all about competence,\u201d says B\u00f8e. \u201cBy conscripting girls we get double the number of potential soldiers, so of course we get a better selection.\u201d\n\nSo undoubtedly fewer girls than guys will end up having to serve because most guys would be physically stronger. However, I don't see how anybody could call this sexism or \"female privilege\" - it's simply a biological fact that women aren't on average as strong as men so probably nobody's expecting to see exactly 50\/50 split combat units. On the other hand, this might be compensated for by putting more girls in non-combat roles. What matters is that both men and women would be judged by the same standards.\n\n> Among the more recent female volunteers is 19-year-old Anette T\u00f8rresen, who serves in the elite 2nd Battalion, a unit specialised in Arctic warfare that has also been deployed to Afghanistan. On the day Newsweek spoke to her, T\u00f8rresen and her fellow 2nd Battalion soldiers had walked up a mountain, each carrying 40kg of gear and equipment, completed a day of shooting exercises there and marched down again. \u201cI believe female conscription is a good thing, and that\u2019s what the boys here say too,\u201d she reports. \u201cIf the women can carry the same amount, the boys are fine having them there.\u201d\n\nLike I said, they already seem to have the right attitude of women having to be held to the same standards as men.\n\n> T\u00f8rresen knows a thing or two about what her male co-fighters think: she shares a room with four of them. And when the girl conscripts arrive, they\u2019ll sleep in the same rooms as boys just as T\u00f8rresen and the other female soldiers \u2013 17% of Norway\u2019s military \u2013 already do. But B\u00f8e says he\u2019s not worried about this nocturnal proximity: \u201cWhen you have a large number of young people, of course you\u2019ll have some problems, but things are improving. The people we take will be smart enough not to get into trouble. And they\u2019ll be busy focusing on their tasks. After a long day\u2019s work, it\u2019s all about equipment maintenance and sleep.\u201d In the US Army, female soldiers on deployment usually curtain off their part of the tent with sheets.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if it really worked out like they were expecting. But Norwegian teenagers seem to be much better educated on birth control and sex in general than, for example, American teenagers (in some regions at least).\n\n> Though Norway plays an active role in international military missions, it\u2019s unlikely that Norway\u2019s female Rambos will parachute behind enemy lines any time soon. Indeed, notes Machowski, \u201cwe\u2019ll be waiting a while to see firstly how women and society respond to the changed policy, and secondly how many women make it from training out into combat,\u201d she adds. Even if a Western coalition were to intervene with ground troops against, say, Islamic State, new conscripts would not be deployed.\n\nWell, obviously nobody's going to send complete newbies to important missions. I'm pretty sure the same holds true for new male conscripts as well.\n\n> A recent poll of male German soldiers reveals widespread concern about their female colleagues\u2019 abilities, with 56.6% of the male soldiers saying women are physically unsuitable for tough frontline conditions.\n\nIt's not entirely clear if they're saying they think women are not suited for frontline positions in general or that they think current women who are employed in these positions are not suited for it. Does anybody have information on whether women in German military are required to pass the same test as men or do they have lower requirements? That could explain a lot, I think.\n\n> The same poll reports that 55% of female soldiers have been sexually molested on the job.\n\nWow, that's extremely high number. I remember reading that about 33% of American military women reported sexual harassment. More than half women experiencing this seems horrible.\n\n> But according to Astrid Vig, a 21-year-old professional soldier who serves as the soldiers\u2019 representative in the Norwegian armed forces board, male soldiers don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a man, woman or the man from the moon as long as you can carry your kit\n\nI doubt that there's zero sexism or discrimination against women in Norwegian military, but then again, Norway is known to be one of the most gender-equal and least sexist countries, so maybe the levels of harrassment are also lower.","title":"Norway is going to include women in mandatory draft.

Because despite these young men reading society *correctly*, despite their true-and-real perception that women, for whatever reason, find disagreeableness attractive in men, they end up with [advice like](http:\/\/unvis.it\/captainawkward.com\/2014\/08\/26\/617-all-the-dating-advice-again\/)\n\n>Step I.

That's not really up for debate, in my eyes.

Often, this type of male is somewhat more sensitive than average, often becoming the confidants of their female friends, willing to listen to their problems and offer advice. \n\nAt some point in their lives, they take note of how lonely they are and how little this makes sense considering how often they are in the company of the opposite sex. Frequently, they are the sort of people who are more likely to be attracted to people they know well, and intimidated by people they don't know well. So they look to their friendships with females and wonder if they can push for one of those friendships to become an intimate relationship.\n\nThis especially seems like it shouldn't be hard, because a lot of these sorts of guys become a dumping ground for their female friends' complaints about their romantic interests. From what the 'nice guy' hears, all of his female friends are romantically involved with terrible jerks who are cause for no end of complaints about their behavior. They get a warped idea of reality because of this, concluding that most of the men that their female friends are with are in fact bad people, when in reality they are only hearing the bad bits.\n\nSome attempt the relationship upgrade and fail, often because the female involved does not want to put a relationship she enjoys at risk for one that might end in hurt feelings (or sometimes she will pretend that this is the case to cover over the fact that she's just not into him.) This is where the concept of the 'friend zone' comes from.\n\nSome never actually bring it up at all, instead wilting in a corner while continuing to hear complaints about other men, never quite getting to the point where they put their relationship and feelings on the line for fear of rejection. They just grow more bitter over time while hoping that one day Senpai will notice them.\n\nIn either case, the old line 'nice guys finish last' seems to them to apply to their situation.\n\nAnd at some point, they come to the internet hoping that perhaps someone can tell them what they're doing wrong, at which point they are castigated as vile, entitled narcissists who think they can buy sex with basic courtesy. The term 'nice guy' is redefined into 'a creepy self-absorbed narcissist' and anyone who tries to defend them is treated as a vile misogynist. A caricature is created to be burned in effigy, as an example to any man who would dare to speak up about such a thing. Articles are written by paid writers in magazines about how terrible these people are.\n\nMany of the nice guys immediately fall on their swords and beg for forgiveness for their terrible transgressions, while others slink back and grow more bitter, their suspicions about the world confirmed.\n\nOr at least that's how I've perceived it. What are your guys' thoughts?\n\nEdit: I want to be extra clear about something that some people have gotten wrong about what I'm saying. I am not saying that the Nice Guy's female friends owe him something, or that they should give in to him, or that they are in any way to blame. Usually I agree that the guys in this situation have things they need to improve on and could be doing things differently. All I am saying is that the typical response to these people online is often misdirected and actively harmful, and should really be significantly blunted.","title":"Most of the anger over 'Nice Guys' is based on demonizing and punishing men who complain about women's behavior.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4spk1k\/most_of_the_anger_over_nice_guys_is_based_on\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

However since I developed an interest in gender issues, specifically men's issues, I've felt increasingly alienated from the left. There's a certain brand of social justice advocacy that I consider harmful to men (and to society as a whole) that is *way* too common on the left. It incorporates these elements:\n\n1. The one-sided, overly simplistic, black-and-white narrative of oppression, \"patriarchy\", and gender war that paints men as privileged, powerful, etc. and downplays\/denies their issues.\n\n2. Practices of treating \"privileged groups\" in ways that would be considered unacceptable to treat \"victim groups\". For example, some people that would be shocked to hear someone make a big deal out of the fact that black people commit more crime on average might have no problem themselves making a big deal out of the fact that men commit more crime on average.\n\n3. Accepting and using traditionalist ideas about gender as long as they line up with their own particular goals (of helping the groups they have sympathy for). I think this form of social justice activism really plays to the \"women are precious and we must protect them\" instinct\/view. At the very least, they don't do much to challenge it.\n\n4. EDIT: Also, in a lot of the actions from this brand of social justice advocacy, I see the puritanism, moralizing, sex-negativity, authoritarianism, and anti-free speech tendencies that I thought people on the left were generally supposed to be against.\n\nBecause of this, I have a really hard time identifying with the left. And yet, I can't really identify with the right either, for many reasons.\n\n1. All the policy stuff that made me prefer the left in the first place. I believe in a strong social safety net (although I think great efforts should be made to make it efficient in terms of resources), and I'd hate to have abortion or gay marriage become illegal. I also care strongly about the environment.\n\n2. Although it's from the right that I see some of the strongest criticisms of the particular strain of social justice activism mentioned above, I have to ask myself what their alternative is. I'm against that type of social justice because (to simplify it a lot) I want *more* gender equality than they advocate. I want gender equality to apply to areas where men are doing worse too. I want us to also take a critical eye to the way we treat men. I don't want to turn everything back and return to traditionalism. For many people on the right, that's what they want.\n\n3. The religion. I don't outright *hate* religion but I am an atheist and I do generally consider religion to be more bad than good. A lot of people on the right base their political views on their religion, and I really can't relate to that. I know it's not obligatory for people on the right but it's definitely a big factor for a lot of them.\n\n**I'm interested in other people's experiences with the left\/right spectrum after gaining an interest in gender issues.** This is most relevant for people interested in men's issues, since women's issues are taken very seriously by one side of the spectrum, but if anyone has any interesting thoughts or experiences regarding women's issues and the spectrum then I'm interested too.","title":"Anyone else feel alienated from the left\/right spectrum after developing an interest in gender issues?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/3u59n6\/anyone_else_feel_alienated_from_the_leftright\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

The idea behind intersectional feminism is that multiple facets of a person\u2019s identity contributes to their experience. It is the recognition that a black woman\u2019s experience will differ in significant ways to an Asian woman\u2019s and that a lesbian\u2019s will differ in significant ways from a straight woman\u2019s. \n\nEach of these facets is described by a position on an axis. Many of these axes, such as gender, can be considered binary or at least strongly bimodal while others are more obviously continuous, such as wealth. Simplistic analysis frequently assigns a linear relationship between position on an axis and privilege. One direction represents more privilege and the other represents less.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get too sidetracked here as it is not super important to the point I am making but I should note that this is not true for everyone applying intersectional feminism. Many do recognise that some axes do not operate so simply. Along some axes there are simply different costs and benefits to being at certain positions. If we are being honest, the gender axis behaves like this. There are some things which are easier for men and others which are easier for women. There are some ways in which men are treated better and others in which women are. \n\nAlso, applied properly, intersectional feminism recognises that the axes interact. You cannot simply sum the privilege from each axis to arrive at a total privilege value. For example, black people are often harmed by the fact that they are seen as dangerous. However, being a woman strongly mitigates this. There are also some privileges or disprivileges which only occur with a particular combination. For example, there is a stereotype that black women are disagreeable but this conflicts with the expectation many have that women should be agreeable.\n\nEvery individual is a unique combination of countless identities.If you are honestly applying intersectional feminism, you can never say \u201cI\u2019m a black lesbian and you\u2019re a straight white man therefore you are more privileged than me.\u201d All other things being equal, that might be true, but all other things are not ever equal. Maybe the black lesbian was born into a wealthy family. Maybe the straight white man is confined to a wheelchair. \n\nMany intersectional feminists do recognise this.However, the simplistic application of intersectional feminism which appears dominant in the media and amonth the most vocal activists does not. Too often, there is near-exclusive focus on four aspects of identity. These are gender, race, sexuality and whether one is trans or cis. Based on these axes, you will be categorised and assumptions about your experiences will be made. \n\nOne neglected axis is neurodiversity. There is a massive blind spot for autism spectrum disorder and many people who consider themselves progressive are open hostility to men who display autistic traits. Often far more so than they are to men who display traits associated with patriarchal dominance.\n\nI want to clarify here that I\u2019m not only talking about people with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. There\u2019s a threshold of impairment which one must cross to actually be diagnosed but that doesn\u2019t mean there is a hard line between those who are autistic and those who are not. It is a spectrum and these traits are present in many people for whom they don\u2019t cause enough impairment to be diagnosed. \n\nMy children have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and, in the process, I recognised that I experience many of the same difficulties they do, just not severe enough, or perhaps too well masked or managed, to meet the criteria for diagnosis. These difficulties have hindered me socially, academically and professionally throughout my life. I have also noticed the same in many of my friends.\n\nThese traits tend to lead to us being classified or identifying as nerds or geeks (Depending on how you personally define those terms. From now on I\u2019ll just use \u201cnerds\u201d). Difficulties socialising are associated with autism and basically a defining quality of nerds. Obsessive pursuit of special interests is again associated with both autism and nerds. \n\nIn many ways, nerd hobbies function as \u201csafe spaces\u201d for those with autistic traits. This is not just for those who don't cross the threshold for diagnosis or those with \u201chigh-functioning\u201d autism, Nerd hobbies often provide the only connection to people outside their families or carers for those who are lower functioning.\n\nI first noticed the hostility to nerds during Gamergate. I was not part of that but it caught my attention because suddenly my identity was under attack from people I had believed to be on my side. I, like most nerds, was a guy who wasn\u2019t into macho culture. I saw and treated women as just as capable as men and I didn\u2019t want to dominate anyone. I was what I was told men should be. Then I started seeing the \u201c[gamers are dead](https:\/\/ggwiki.deepfreeze.it\/index.php?title=Gamers_Are_Dead)\u201d articles and realised something was off. Calls to \u201c[bring back bullying](https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/photos\/941794-gamergate)\u201d from the anti-gamergate side, which identified with social justice and intersectional feminism, really drove it home. My social difficulties had made me a favorite target of bullies for most of my schooling and those tweets could only come from a complete lack of empathy for me and those who experienced the same or worse.\n\nSince Gamergate, we have seen nerd communities continuously vilified. Social awkwardness of nerdy men around women (and nerdy boys around girls) has been redefined as a rejection of women (and girls) despite the fact that more women being in to the same hobbies would be a dream come true for most heterosexual nerdy men. The diversity in hobbies like comics has been ignored in favor of a myth that all comic book heroes were white straight men until the recent push to change the media. There have been black superheroes in comics since the 60s. The late 90s even saw 2 big film adaptations with black superheroes (Spawn and Blade). However when the Black Panther movie was released, it was commonly thought that this would blow nerds\u2019 minds.\n\n> [Black Panther might be the biggest, blackest movie ever made. And white nerds are going to have to go see it, because it's a Marvel movie. They are going to have to learn to identify with someone who doesn't look like them, who doesn't live where they live, who doesn't talk or act the way they do. They are going to have to learn cinematic empathy.](https:\/\/archive.is\/nWM6T)\n\nNerds have been identifying and empathising with characters totally unlike themselves for longer than the author of that article has been alive but history is being rewritten so that nerds can be the villains.\n\nThis is hurtful because nerd communities have, in general, been accepting. Of course there are going to be exceptions but in every nerd community I have interacted with, the only condition for entry was passion for the subject. Your race was irrelevant. If your gender was relevant at all, being a woman more often granted better treatment, not worse, from the many male nerds who were desperate for female approval.\n\nIt hurts to be portrayed as the one ostracising others when I spent my formative years being ostracised. Nerds know what it is like to be the outsider and few of us would wish to inflict that on others. However, I am told that, because I am a straight white man, I don\u2019t know what it is like to be an outsider. This denies my experiences and the similar experiences of countless other nerds.\n\nThere seems to be an urgent need to invalidate the experiences of socially awkward men. [A comment by Scott Aaronson about the difficulties of growing up a shy nerdy male received many responses doing exactly that.](https:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2015\/01\/01\/untitled\/)\n\nThe tech boom has been used to pretend that \u201cnerdy male\u201d is a privileged identity. Yes, some nerds have made a fortune, most have not. Outside of a few flukes, strong social skills are still at least as important if not more so than technical skills. People creating startups need to sell the idea to investors. People looking for jobs in tech still need to sell themselves to employers and promotions generally lead to managerial positions which require people skills more than technical skills. The most common outcome I have seen in my industry (software development) is good programmers staying in jobs where they are taken advantage of because they lack the ability to negotiate with their employers and have a strong aversion to the interview process required to change jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201ctech bros\u201d who more often do well. They feel at ease in social situations and this lets them succeed despite often having mediocre technical skills. The tech bro was never a nerd. In fact they are more likely to have been the people bullying the nerds. However, popular social justice rhetoric treats these two as interchangeable and, in doing so, holds the nerds accountable for the behavior of the tech bros.\n\nAnother thing used to pretend that nerds are privileged is the popularisation of nerd culture. If this was happening along one of the more commonly recognised axes, it would be called cultural appropriation. Nerds in general are not gaining any social status from the wider adoption of our hobbies. Quite the opposite. We are finding ourselves pushed out of these hobbies, our safe spaces in the name of diversity and inclusion.\n\nIt\u2019s increasingly popular for formerly-nerdy media, to send the vert clear message to nerdy men that \u201cthis isn\u2019t yours any more.\u201d Simply introducing new, more diverse, characters would be a great thing to do. However, the trend is to do so by tearing down the old characters we identified with. Thor was declared unworthy so Jane Foster could take his place, A teenage girl is better at being Tony Stark than Tony Stark and Luke Skywalker betrayed everything his character stood for in the original trilogy.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not just making people feel unwelcome in their own spaces. Many have also been forced out in the name of diversity. As I mentioned previously, nerd hobbies are also spaces for those with lower functioning autism. Magic the Gathering was one such space. A significant subset of players were guys who genuinely couldn\u2019t take care of themselves. They were totally socially awkward, often smelled due to personal hygiene issues. They lived with their parents permanently and were driven by their families to game stores to play Magic. \n\nOf course people like this make others feel uncomfortable. The existing Magic community tolerated them and even somewhat babysat them while their families had a much needed break. However, as making these spaces more welcoming to (neurotypical) women became a priority, these men were told they were no longer welcome.\n\nUnder the banner of diversity and inclusion, activists keep developing more complex social norms in rather arbitrary ways and imposing severe social and professional consequences for getting them wrong. This creates an even sacrier social landscape for those who already struggle with social cues. Those people can\u2019t even take refuge in their old safe spaces because those same ever-changing norms are forced into those spaces too.\n\nThe lack of social skills is being redefined as as a moral failing. Men are admonished to [Learn to read a fucking room.](https:\/\/archive.is\/Dkcrn), something those with autism struggle to master. They defend the labelling of men as \u201c[creepy](https:\/\/jezebel.com\/why-guys-really-hate-being-called-creepy-5903883)\u201d despite the fact that actually dangerous people can be perfectly charming while a little harmless social awkwardness can make someone seem very \u201ccreepy\u201d. Awkward, failed romantic approaches are treated as misogynistic. This show very little empathy and compassion for those who are not neurotypical.\n\nThere is also use of slurs like \u201cNeckbeard.\u201d These are popular when shutting down men who disagree with social justice talking points. These conjure an image which looks an awful lot like those low-functioning men forced out of the Magic the Gathering community. The image is a socially awkward, poorly groomed man who has failed to find a girlfriend or grow up and move out of his parents house.\n\nRomantic relationships are often especially difficult for those with traits associated with autism and romantically unsuccessful men seem especially hated. (I\u2019ll leave aside actual self-identified Incels because while it is not true of all of them, many, do behave in ways which are deserving of scorn.) The vilification of the \u201cnice guy\u201d through conflation with a totally different type of man is a strong example of this.\n\nOriginally, a \u201cnice guy\u201d got the label because he complained that despite being nice to women, he remained romantically unsuccessful. The complaint was \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy so why don\u2019t I have a girlfriend?\u201d. It is correctly pointed out that being nice does not entitle you to a romantic relationship but that response totally misses the context of the complaint. These men have heard countless women complain that they cannot find a nice guy while repeatedly dating guys who, clearly, aren\u2019t nice. Meanwhile they are nice to women and are never given a chance. I understand this frustration because it was my own for many years. Scott Alexander wrote a great post about this called [Radicalizing the Romanceless](https:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2014\/08\/31\/radicalizing-the-romanceless\/).\n\nRather than receiving empathy, these men are vilified by pushing an alternative definition. That is a man who pretends to be nice to a woman while trying to sleep with her but instantly becomes an asshole when rejected. This brush is then used to paint the men in the first group. What provoked me to finally write this post was a recent [article](https:\/\/archive.is\/UCk3w) which appears to have once again redefined \u201cnice guy,\u201d  this time to mean \u201crapist.\u201d\n\n> There are some points where the script is a little too on-the-nose, making it sometimes feel like Cassie is throttling egregious permutations of Brock Turner and his apologists. Some plainly state their intentions, or bluntly say something so infuriating, that there\u2019s maybe something too convenient about how evil is presented. This is especially true when reality has taught us that the most monstrous \u201cnice guys\u201d and their apologists know how to work a system.\n\nA favorite complaint about male behavior is \u201cmansplaining.\u201d While having something explained to you that you already knew (or worse, which you know to be wrong) can certainly be annoying, it is wrong to assume it is always sexism when a man does it to a woman. Most examples of this I have seen complained about look very much like behaviors associated with autism. Many of those with autism spectrum disorder love to talk about their special interests at great length and often don\u2019t read the cues that their listeners aren\u2019t interested. The enthusiasm to jump to accusations of sexism might be described as ableist.\n\nMedia personalities and activists interested in social justice frequently call for empathy and inclusion for those on the disprivileged side of an intersectional axis. Neurodiversity is one such axis and the non-neurotypical side is certainly not the privileged one. Unfortunately, as I have discussed above, a great deal of the loudest voices appear ignorant of this. They invalidate the experiences of men who are socially challenged, exclude people with autistic traits, even from the spaces those people built for themselves and they pretend that these people are the bad guys.","title":"Neurodiversity: a forgotten intersectional axis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/l2jt90\/neurodiversity_a_forgotten_intersectional_axis\/","upvote_ratio":0.97,"over_18":false}

And that needs to be acknowledged to understand the grievances many have with the movement. \n\nThe National Organization for Women (NOW) is the largest feminist lobbying organization on the planet. And they routinely fight against divorce law reform and equal child custody for men.\n\nhttps:\/\/nationalparentsorganization.org\/blog\/21752-karen-decrow-last-now-president-to-support-shared-parenting-dies\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was championed for by the feminist establishment and all it did was replace a perfectly fine gender neutral domestic violence law with a gendered one that discriminates against male victims.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.saveservices.org\/pdf\/SAVE-VAWA-Discriminates-Against-Males.pdf\n\nThe Feminist Majority Foundation, spearheaded by Katherine Spillar, has pushed for discriminatory sexual assault and domestic violence laws.\n\nMs magazine, which is the largest feminist publication on the planet, has helped them in the past by rallying up their readers to support them.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/ds09dz\/how_feminists_have_defined_rape_and_influenced\/\n\nJezebel has published articles advocating for wives to murder and rape their husbands. Ms and everydayfeminism have published equally nasty articles about men.\n\nhttps:\/\/jezebel.com\/have-you-ever-beat-up-a-boyfriend-cause-uh-we-have-294383\n\nProminent feminist scholars and gender studies professors have asked if we can't go ahead and just \"hate all men\". Others have outlined plans to murder 90% of men and put the rest of labor and sex camps. These aren't random assholes on the Internet -- these are famous leaders in the feminist establishment who have a platform (and a salary) because of the feminist movement.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/why-cant-we-hate-men\/2018\/06\/08\/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html\n\nSo why do you never see feminists standing up against these things? Why do they never organize protests or write letters to NOW or Ms. to express their displeasure? Perhaps even under the context of telling them not to do it because it makes other feminists look bad?\n\nWhy is it in fact they often do exactly the opposite. Many stand behind the rhetoric that those are \"radical feminists\". Many will straight up deny that it is a problem.\n\nA quick \"you know you're right, the movement isn't perfect and we've been working on that recently\" is all we really need. Acknowledge the problem, work on it, and then be a good ally.\n\nBut all they do is pretend that it's not an issue. Which only helps defend \"radical feminism\" and therefore exasperates the problem.\n\nA Feminist who supports gender equality should be equally as upset about this as anyone else.\n\nSo where are these Feminists? Are they perhaps ex-feminists now? Do MRAs count as \"true feminists\" at this point? Or is radical feminism such a big problem that moderate voices are never heard?","title":"By denying that any of the feminist establishment could be hostile towards men, Many feminists who care about gender equality are complicit in helping to defend sexism and discrimination against men.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/jtimwe\/by_denying_that_any_of_the_feminist_establishment\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

Thank you admins for granting me posting privileges. \n\nAfter the MGTOW and MGTOW2 ban recently, there have been a lot of questions raised by some as to why men's spaces have been targeted for removal (whether or not they have been perceived as being \"hate subs\"), while other subs that cater to women's spaces that exhibit the same level of perception (though on the opposite gender side of the spectrum) are being catered to.\n\nSomewhere along the line, I came across a post that had the following image:\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VeTS3YH.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VeTS3YH.png)\n\nI was very disheartened to find out that the policies of Reddit are blatantly and unapologetically biased against specific groups of individuals. This is creating quite a few perceived confirmation biases among the targeted communities:\n\n* Men are being targeted and attacked just because they're men, and all men are bad.\n* Men's voices are being silenced and their presence removed from online platforms because they are some kind of enemy that needs to be destroyed.\n* It's okay to attack white people because they are white, and it's not racist toward them because one cannot be racist toward white people.\n\nThis is type of action on Reddit's part strikes me personally, because I have observed these biases directed toward me (white male) in my actual workplace, where I was targeted by a black female supervisor who for some reason didn't like me and not only sabotaged my work, but got me demoted and banned from being promoted for 2 years. I've been at the same place for over 6 years now, and the black stain on my record has prevented me from even being considered for promotions. Having been through the union and civil service commissions, and being told there was nothing that could be done because I'm not a \"protected class\", coming across this post only leads me to believe that I wasn't imagining things, and that I actually was a target because she didn't like white men and could get away with it, and that my workplace isn't an anomaly, and that this kind of tragedy is more systemically widespread than I realized.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Has Reddit become a place that empowers and encourages protected groups to gang up on unprotected groups and have them silenced because there is no place here for dissenting opinions?\n2. How is it that a non-protected group could expect to have open and honest discussions without fear of retaliation just for having an opinion protected groups disagree with?\n3. Is Reddit becoming another echo chamber of protected group extremists, who have the backing of the Reddit policies, and the power of the Reddit admins, who have been given free reign to \"cancel\" their \"enemies\"?\n4.

Sweden was previously mentioned for its failures when it came to early medical transition and broadly applying the Dutch model to minors despite the lacking evidence connected to it's implementation.\n\nThis is, understandably a possibility when we move forward with insufficient evidence. And a reason why we often like to have clinical trials of new applications of treatments.\n\n> The hormonal treatment of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria may \r\nconsist of puberty-blocking treatment initiated at the onset of puberty, and cross-sex \r\nhormones initiated at the age of 16. These treatments are controversial and have \r\nrecently become subject to increased attention and scrutiny both nationally and \r\ninternationally. In December 2019, the SBU (Swedish Agency for Health Technology \r\nAssessment and Assessment of Social Services) published an overview of the \r\nknowledge base which showed a lack of evidence for both the long-term \r\nconsequences of the treatments, and the reasons for the large influx of patients in \r\nrecent years. These treatments are potentially fraught with extensive and irreversible \r\nadverse consequences such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, infertility, \r\nincreased cancer risk, and thrombosis. This makes it challenging to assess the risk \/\r\nbenefit for the individual patient, and even more challenging for the minors and their \r\nguardians to be in a position of an informed stance regarding these treatments.\n\r\n> A highly publicized court case in Great Britain shed light on this issue and in a recent \r\nruling (December 1st, 2020), established overarching problems associated with\r\npuberty-blocking treatment. Further, the ruling specifically establishes that it is highly \r\nunlikely, if at all possible, for an individual under the age of 16 to give informed \r\nconsent to this treatment. For individuals between the age of 16 and 18, the court \r\nconsiders it advisable to request court approval before starting hormonal treatment, \r\nsince the treatment should be considered experimental. As a result of this ruling, the \r\nNHS (National Health Service) put an end to initiating hormonal treatments in new \r\ncases of individuals under 16, while recommending a thorough review of ongoing, \r\nactively treated cases. For patients between ages 16 and 18, it is recommended that \r\nthe treating physician receives court approval before cross-sex hormones are \r\ninitiated.","title":"Sweden's Karolinska Ends the Use of Puberty Blockers for <16: New policy statement from the Karolinska Hospital","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/n60bbg\/swedens_karolinska_ends_the_use_of_puberty\/","upvote_ratio":0.94,"over_18":false}

An opportunity women who actually live in traditional cultures would actually value.\n\nSo, I have been in the Radical Feminism community for a while now- and a lot of their concerns are legit (like male-on-female violence, but Male-on-male violence is common too) and I am not a fan of trans culture due to legit reasons. But- ultimately what I see on Radical Feminist communities is basically rehash of what religious\/conservative women have told all the while- including shaming women for being sexually attracted to men and wearing revealing clothes\/makeup out of one's own volition as being brainwashed to appeal to men.\n\nThe only major difference is that religious women are forcing women to marry unattractive, older men while feminists gaslight and shame women for choosing to have standards. I personally told once that looks and sex appeal is very important in a man and women who call themselves feminists shamed me for being \"shallow\".\n\nI am not exactly a big fan of the hook-up culture for myself but I have actively seen women shaming other women even their friends for not giving chance to men that are considered borderline unattractive even by traditional standards.\n\nSo I personally feel like there is nothing really different being a pickmeisha and a High Value Women. Both are different side of the same coin.\n\nLike the issue of prostitution and porn- Prostitution legit has women and children being trafficked and forced into such professions. But both radfems and social conservatives are actively trying to do put down sex work as a lesser profession and \"where you won't get respect\". Just that social conservatives much more volatile while radical feminists take a more patronising tone(funny a lot of female trads also have the same attitude). \n\nFrankly instead of solving the problems radical feminists and their ideology are increasing the issues more even though they might genuinely be well-meaning. I would actually say that they are worsening the main issue by their own projection and thinking flipping the model would help. Like marrying early in an arranged marriage situation using arbitrary compatibility tests like horoscopes- I have seen a lot of Western women wish they had this support system but as a person from a country which actually still has the joint family and arranged marriage system- I would say it is probably better to accept your fate than bringing even more destruction for a slight fantasy","title":"Radical Feminism is basically Conservatism packaged in Gynocentric Avatar","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/n4n7dy\/radical_feminism_is_basically_conservatism\/","upvote_ratio":0.84,"over_18":false}

Others are more benevolent: the love and concern for someone they care deeply for pushing them to one idea or another. In one moment we are each one, and then the other, and on occasion sometimes both. We get angry because others promote idea or practices that we fear may hurt us, or because we fear that they may hurt those who mean most to us. Whether we fight for ourselves, or for others, it is usually unknowable to all be each individual.

I only feel the need to preface with this given how uncharitable people can get when you\u2019re even remotely critical of ideologies such as the one\u2019s discussed here. I am also not an anti-feminist - though I do have strong objections to feminist rhetoric, institutions, and academia.\n\n###Introduction\n\nGender issues - we\u2019re all aware of them. Men and women are expected to conform to certain roles, and are often punished when they don\u2019t.\n\nIn the last century an ideology known as feminism emerged and rooted itself in progressive circles. Their initial concerns were legitimate; women couldn\u2019t vote, own property, or divorce, among other things. The ideology achieved many victories, both legislative and social. Today, feminism is more popular than ever, garnering support from celebrities and multinational organizations like the United Nations. It\u2019s taught in many schools as part of their mandatory curriculum, it\u2019s widely supported among most progressives, and many would argue you would need to be one in order to even call yourself a progressive.\n\nWhy, then, is feminism so polarizing? Surely, there are plenty of women\u2019s issues that exist today, and aside from far-right tradcons, who could really disagree with the fundamental premise of gender equality? Detractors of the ideology commonly claim that it\u2019s \u201cgone too far\u201d - but what does that even mean? Many progressives claim that detractors of the ideology are reactionaries who simply misunderstand it. Is this really true? What\u2019s actually going on here?\n\n###The Feminist Hypothesis\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to define feminism. If asked to define the ideology, most would say something like \u201cthe belief that both genders are equal \/ should be treated equally under the law\u201d. This is an incomplete definition, however. This would be similar to defining liberalism as the belief in democracy. Of course, whilst believing in democracy is a necessary condition of liberalism, it\u2019s not sufficient. Socialists (and even some fascists) believe in democracy, and they certainly aren\u2019t liberals. Liberalism requires other beliefs, such as the right to private property (which socialists reject) and the belief in human rights (which fascists reject).\n\nFeminism, then, is more than just the belief in equality under the law. The other beliefs varies depending on the school of thought, but they\u2019re all united in sharing one fundamental claim: that we live in a patriarchy that privileges men at the expense of women. More specifically, they argue that femininity is seen as inherently inferior to masculinity, and thus, all gender issues are fundamentally rooted in misogyny. For instance, it\u2019s socially acceptable (even celebrated) for women to act masculine (eg, tomboys), but men who act feminine or often punished for it (they might be denigrated with insults that compare them to women - \u2018pussy\u2019, \u2018sissy\u2019, etc.). You can likely name several films with relatively masculine women (Ripley from Alien, Sarah Connor from Terminator, etc.), but almost no feminine male heroes. Women are punished for being women, men are punished when they aren\u2019t masculine enough.\n\nFeminists conclude that the patriarchy hurts both men and women, and thus, everyone should be feminists and dismantle the patriarchy. \n\n###Critique\n\nThe issue with this hypothesis, and progressive gender ideology as a whole, is that it promotes a massive asymmetry in the way we view men\u2019s issues compared to women\u2019s. Progressives claim to value gender equality, but in reality they end up reinforcing the most rigid form of gender essentialism, even more-so than modern conservatives. This can be seen both in their rhetoric and in the legislation\/social policies they support. I will demonstrate this by examining popular rhetoric and arguments used by feminists and progressives.\n\n**Toxic Masculinity**\n\nA controversial term that has emerged in recent years, \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d refers to the harmful set of expectations placed on men that causes them to hurt themselves or others. For instance, men are expected to be stoic, and so they may be less likely to seek out help when they need it. Men are expected to sleep with women, so they may physically lash out when rejected, since sexual conquest is tied to their self-worth.\n\nMany progressives claim that opponents of the term simply misunderstand it, but in reality, the reason people dislike the term is because there is a hypocritical asymmetry since \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d is never discussed. Progressives end up being the biggest reinforcers of the traditional \u201ctoxic\u201d masculine roles they claim to oppose. \n\nFor instance, the male suicide rate is often condescendingly blamed on \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. We get the typical spiels from mainstream media about how men are pressured to be stoic, and if they could just open up emotionally, the male suicide rate would drop. This is an utterly bizarre argument, because statistically women are actually more likely to attempt suicide than men (men are more likely to succeed), yet this is never blamed on \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d. Notice how mainstream media never claims that women are conditioned to be hyper-emotional, and if they could just learn to suppress their emotions, the attempted female suicide rate would drop. \n\nConsider too that women tend to not report rape or sexual assault out of a sense of shame or guilt. Would any progressive claim this is a consequence of \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d - that women are pressured to be sexually chaste and \u201cpure\u201d, and that explains the lack of reporting? If anyone were to actually make such an argument, those same progressives would likely call them a victim blamer, yet this rhetoric is completely acceptable when it comes to men.\n\nIn other words, men and women both share the same reasons for committing suicide or not reporting rape (eg, shame), but it\u2019s only framed as a systemic failure for women. For men, it\u2019s framed as an insecure shortcoming, that they\u2019re letting the pressures of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d get to them, and they should just \u201cdo better\u201d and seek help.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that women reinforce these \u201ctoxic\u201d gender norms just as much as men, but that\u2019s never acknowledged by progressives. Consider the [controversial Gilette ad](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0) from a few years ago, where they attempted to \u201ctackle toxic masculinity\u201d. In the entirety of the ad, only men are blamed for reinforcing harmful masculine gender norms, women are completely absolved (aside from a couple of audience members during the sitcom segment). In fact, [at one point the ad shows](https:\/\/youtu.be\/koPmuEyP3a0?t=29) a male employee silencing a female employee - even when progressives try to talk about men\u2019s issues, they can\u2019t help but make it about women\u2019s issues as well. \n\nThis asymmetry is more explicitly clear when you enumerate all the possibilities:\n\n* Man is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity\n\n* Man is sexist against woman: Toxic masculinity (not \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d)\n\n* Woman is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity\n\n* Women is sexist against woman: Internalized Misogyny (not \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d)\n\nWhen men receive sexism, it\u2019s their \u201ctoxic masculine gender role\u201d that oppresses them - in other words, they oppress themselves. But when women receive sexism, they are just simply victims to misogyny. If a woman tells a man to man-up, it\u2019s considered toxic masculinity since it reinforces the traditional masculine gender role of stoicism. But if a man criticizes a woman for sexual promiscuity, it\u2019s not considered toxic femininity, despite it reinforcing the traditional feminine gender role of chastity (in fact, it\u2019s considered another instance of toxic masculinity). So whether men or women reinforce harmful gender expectations of either gender, it\u2019s labelled \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. The term essentially becomes synonymous with \u201csexism\u201d. This is the fundamental issue people have with the term - the inherit conflation of \u2018masculinity\u2019 with \u2018sexism\u2019 - the asymmetry. \n\nThe great irony here is that progressives end up reinforcing the very traditional gender norms they claim to be against. That is, that men possess hyper-agency and can never be victims, that their problems are of their own causing, and that women are just helpless victims who do no wrong. \n\nIt's not surprising, then, that the biggest feminist messages to men in the last few years have just reinforced the traditional \u201ctoxic\u201d gender norm that men should be protectors. Look at the United Nation's [#HeForShe](https:\/\/www.heforshe.org\/en) campaign, that suggested men should essentially protect women. It's no different than telling men to \"man up\", it's just rebranded in woke packaging to make it palatable to progressives, and it works. Notice too that these demands are never asked of women (there is no #SheForHe). Progressive demand men to be traditionally masculine, whilst simultaneously criticizing them for it.\n\n**Patriarchy**\n\nThere is perhaps no term in modern discourse more useless or vague than \u201cpatriarchy\u201d. It\u2019s used as a buzzword by progressives (along with \u201ccapitalism\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d) to explain away almost any phenomenon in modern society. Earlier we defined the patriarchy as a social system that \u201cprivileges\u201d men at the expense of women (or values masculinity over femininity), but the way progressives have abused this term borders on unfalsifiable tautology - framing all gender issues as women\u2019s issues.\n\nAccording to progressives, if women commit more suicide than men, that's evidence that we live in a sexist patriarchy. But if men commit suicide more than women, that's also evidence we live in a sexist patriarchy, and this is an instance of the patriarchy hurting men. Men are given harsher sentences for the same crime? Actually that\u2019s patriarchal backfiring, since society views women as having no agency. Women get custody more often? Well that\u2019s because society views women as the caretaker, so it\u2019s actually misogyny. Only men are drafted? Of course, society views women as weak and incapable - misogyny. No matter the outcome, it's always framed as patriarchy\/misogyny, it\u2019s just taken as an axiomatic truth.\n\nTo test whether a claim is vacuous, a useful exercise is to reverse the situation and see if the conclusion still holds. Suppose we lived a society where gender roles were reversed. Men would have issues with domestic violence, date-rape, representation in politics, wouldn\u2019t be taken as seriously in the workplace, catcalling, were judged more for their looks, etc., and women would have a higher suicide rate, get harsher prison sentences for the same crime, get worse school grades for the same work, it would be legal to cut off their clitoral hoods at birth and suck their genital wounds (the male equivalent would be \u201coral suction circumcision\u201d - yes this is an actual thing).\n\nWould anyone look at such a society and deem it an \u201coppressive matriarchy\u201d that \u201cprivileges\u201d women over men? If not, then why is it when the roles are reversed (as it is in our society) it\u2019s deemed as an \u201coppressive patriarchy\u201d that \u201cprivileges\u201d men over women?\n\n**Male Privilege** \n\nProgressives are also very selective when they examine gender inequality, largely overlooking men\u2019s issues, or even framing them as a privilege.\n\nConsider the gender wage gap. Progressives\/feminists argue that the reason women earn less than men is because of sexist social pressures that encourage women to be stay-at-home mom\u2019s and discourages them from higher-paying careers. Whether this is truly the result of sexism or biological predispositions is not what I care to discuss, but what is interesting is that the other side is never talked about; that is, that men are socially pressured to earn money. Consider if the roles were reversed; suppose men were pressured to be stay-at-home dad\u2019s and take care of the children, whereas women were pressured to work dangerous jobs, work overtime, and would be considered deadbeats otherwise. \n\nIf this were the case, there would be no discussion of a gender pay gap for men. Instead, we would hear of a gender labor and death gap for women. We would hear complaints that women were expected to work more hours than men, expected to take physically dangerous work, and die more often on the job. We would get statistics about how \u201con average, women work X amount of hours more than men in a year\u201d. We would hear about the negative health consequences of stress and working overtime, the toll that being the primary breadwinner has on a person, how men need to \u201cstep up\u201d and stop placing the burden of income on women alone. Yet, when this expectation is placed upon men, there is zero discussion about the burden of being the breadwinner - in fact, quite the opposite, it\u2019s framed as a privilege.\n\n**\u201dBut the Patriarchy hurts men too!\u201d**\n\nOne popular talking point among progressives is that the \u201cpatriarchy\u201d hurts men as well, and that critics of feminism mistake \u201cpatriarchy\u201d as synonymous with \u201cmen\u201d, but this is far from the truth.\n\nConsider the recent overturning of Roe v Wade. To be clear, I think the ban is wrong, but the response from many feminists is telling; they immediately jump to blaming men, despite the fact that men and women [share similar views](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2019\/5\/20\/18629644\/abortion-gender-gap-public-opinion) on abortion. Abortion is split among political lines, not gender lines, and despite progressives wishing the opposite, conservative women do exist.\n\nSo here we see the hypocrisy. On one hand they will claim that the patriarchy hurts men and women, and therefore feminism ought to be accepted by men. Yet, as soon as women are hurt by \u201cthe patriarchy\u201d, the blame is immediately put on men, despite the fact that women reinforce\/uphold harmful gender norms just as much as men. The fact that plenty of women supported the ban is ignored in favour of a convenient \u201cmale bad\u201d narrative.\n\nSimilarly, if the \u201cpatriarchy\u201d ends up hurting men, women\u2019s agency\/responsibility is totally ignored, and thus, the blame will lie on men. The term \u201cpatriarchy\u201d becomes synonymous with \u201cmen\u201d, with progressives blaming all of societies shortcomings on men alone.\n\nIf the hypocritical rhetoric is bad, the hypocritical institutions are far worse. Self-proclaimed feminist organizations like the United Nations (which claims to stand for gender equality) [finances the genital mutilation](https:\/\/news.un.org\/en\/story\/2011\/12\/397192-un-launches-plan-accelerate-male-circumcision-aids-prevention-africa) of men in the Third World. whilst condemning the same mutilation of women. Then, that very same institution has the audacity to suggest that \u201cmen aren\u2019t doing enough\u201d, that \u201cmen need to stand against sexism\u201d, and proceed to roll out initiatives like #HeForShe.  \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that in the case of circumcision, the discarded foreskin is sometimes used to [produce skincare products](https:\/\/thesun.co.uk\/fabulous\/7836602\/foreskin-facial-kate-beckinsale-how-serum-made\/) for wealthy celebrities and socialites (likely the same that virtue signal about how misogynistic our society is). Could anyone imagine if male celebrities used skincare products derived from the skin tissue of amputated clitoral hoods from infant girls? Doubtless we would have international outrage and academic discourse about the \u201ccommodification of the female body\u201d and whatnot. When it happens to men - radio silence (or mockery).\n\n**Progressives use right-wing rhetoric when it comes to men\u2019s issues**\n\nMen\u2019s issues are dismissed by progressives in the same way black issues are dismissed by conservatives. For instance, progressives blame the fact that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes on other men, since men commit the majority of violent crime. Notice how this is no different to when conservatives blame black issues on black people. Compare \u201cbut it\u2019s mostly men killing other men\u201d to \u201cbut it\u2019s mostly black people killing other black people\u201d. Would progressives be okay with terms like \u201ctoxic blackness\u201d to describe the negative aspects of black culture - eg, high crime rate, lack of fathers, misogyny in rap music, etc?\n\nConsider the fact that men are given harsher sentences for the same crime, compared to women. Feminists would argue that this is because society assigns hyper-agency to men and views women as weak and infantile, thus, men get harsher sentences. They would argue this is an example of how sexism against women ends up hurting men, that this is our patriarchal society \u201cbackfiring\u201d on men. But notice that this logic completely falls apart when you swap gender for race. For instance, black people are sentenced to harsher sentences for the same crime compared to white people. Would any progressive unironically argue that this is because society views white people as weak and incapable, and thus this is an example of how racism against white people ends up hurting black people, that this is our \u201cblack supremacist\u201d society backfiring on black people? The latter would be rightfully ridiculed, whereas the former is accepted and taught in sociology classes.\n\nUnder the feminist framework, it\u2019s okay to blame men\u2019s biological predispositions to dismiss male violence \/ male victims of violence, but don\u2019t you dare suggest that those same biological predispositions may explain why men are more likely to be CEO\u2019s. In other words, men\u2019s failures are their responsibility, but their successes are not - their successes are the result of sexism, they\u2019re illegitimate. (To be clear, I am not suggesting that biological predispositions are indeed the reason why men are more likely to be CEO\u2019s; I am merely pointing out the hypocritical reasoning)\n\n\n**Media**\n\nSo how are men\u2019s issues talked about by the media? Well, for the most part, they aren\u2019t. But when they are, it can vary from blaming men for their issues (the typical spiels on toxic masculinity) to outright hostility.\n\n\u201cProgressive\u201d media outlet, Slate, once [ran an Op-Ed](https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2013\/09\/intactivists-online-a-fringe-group-turned-the-internet-against-circumcision.html) where they characterized and straw-manned the entire anti-circumcision movement as nothing but unhinged freaks, comparing them to anti-vaxxers. The article goes into great length smugly psycho-analyzing the motives of these activists, not even pretending to show balance or their side of the argument.\n\nThe United Nations absurdly claimed that [women would be the most impacted](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/03\/11\/un-women-says-russia-ukraine-war-exacts-high-price-from-women-girls.html) in regards to the invasion of Ukraine, despite men (some still being in high school) being banned from leaving the country. Evidently, men being forcibly conscripted to fight and possibly die doesn\u2019t count as gender-based violence. It\u2019s also worth noting that the UN emphasizes girls specifically, rather than all child refugees (boys and girls). Again, this is the same institution that tells men they just need to \u201cdo better\u201d and stand up against inequality. \n \nVice, another \u201cprogressive\u201d outlet, [recently wrote an article](https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/y3vx8k\/south-korea-incel-gender-wars-election-womens-rights) about the South Korean election, titled \u201cYoung, Angry, Misogynistic, and Male: Inside South Korea\u2019s Incel Election\u201d. \n\nTo summarize, the article describes how anti-feminist rhetoric has emerged as an electoral campaign topic among the populist candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol (in fact, he won the election as of writing this). The article mentions how these male voters feel disenfranchised from South Korean society, given the blatant double standards. For instance, military service is mandatory for men when they finish high school, but not for women. This means men have to abandon their families for 1.5 years while women get a head start in their careers. The candidate, Yoon, vowed to abolish the Ministry of Women, a division of the government concerned with women\u2019s issues. Aside from some vague mentions of political bias and claims that the ministry \u201ctreats men like criminals\u201d, the article never describes why he wants to abolish it, or why the voters want him to abolish it, it\u2019s just taken as a presupposition that the Ministry is fair and just. \n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the entire article. This, according to Vice, makes you a \u201cmisogynistic incel\u201d. We\u2019re so deeply-entrenched in \u201cprogressive\u201d gender politics that merely pointing out the double standard that men must do mandatory service is enough for \u201cprogressive\u201d outlets to label you a women-hating incel. There\u2019s not a single man they interview in the article that express any entitlement to women. Just being opposed to the hypocrisy makes you an incel apparently.\n\nIt\u2019s totally possible that the candidate is indeed a misogynist or has sexist policy positions - I don\u2019t know much about South Korea - but the greater point here is that the article never mentions any of this. According to the internal logic of Vice, men merely being upset at blatant double standards is enough for them to be labelled misogynistic incels. It\u2019s also worth noting the hypocrisy of these \u201cprogressive\u201d media outlets in labelling young men who are rightfully upset about being discriminated against as incels, despite these same outlets decrying how widespread \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d is, completely oblivious to how they reinforce it by characterizing any man who points out male discrimination as being a bitter, angry virgin.\n\nNone of these articles were hard to find. I found the first one through a basic google search, and the other two from trending twitter\/reddit posts. There are dozens of more like this written every year, this was just a small sampling of how ridiculously hysterical progressive media is towards men\u2019s issues.\n\n**Nice Guys**\n\nSpeaking of incels, the entire phenomenon of \"nice guys\" (men who disingenuously befriend women in an attempt to sleep with them) is ironically exacerbated by the very same \"progressives\" who claim to want to \"liberate\" men from their confined gender roles.\n\nProgressives, and mainstream media as a whole, demonizes male sexuality, characterizing it as creepy or predatory. Consider again the controversial Gilette ad from a few years back. There's a [scene where a man goes to approach a woman](https:\/\/youtu.be\/koPmuEyP3a0?t=56), and then is stopped by his friend. It's the middle of the day, broad daylight, busy street, etc. so the woman is in no danger, yet according to progressives, even approaching women in public is problematic nowadays.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that teenage boys take these messages to heart - that they\u2019re inherently predatory and must suppress any desire to be blunt or forthcoming with what they want. They act amicable, nice, and passive, because that\u2019s what they were told to do, and more importantly, they don\u2019t want to risk being branded as a creep or sexual predator. When this inevitably doesn\u2019t work out, they express frustration, and then the very same group that told them to act that way demonizes and mocks them for it.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then why figures like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate get popular. The right-wing gives an alternative to alienated young men that doesn\u2019t demonize them for being born with a penis.\n\n###Conclusion\n\nThe message from progressives\/feminists is clear. Women\u2019s issues are caused by society, and so society must change to accommodate women. Men\u2019s issues are caused by men, and so men must \u201cdo better\u201d and change to accommodate society. Women\u2019s issues are systemic - men\u2019s issues are individual failures. Social change for women - pull yourself by your bootstraps for men. \n\nUnder the feminist framework, sexism against men is framed as male privilege, whereas sexism that benefits women is framed as female oppression (consider the term \u201cbenevolent\u201d sexism - even when women benefit, they\u2019re still victims). Their rhetoric and language portray a victim narrative for women, and an oppressor narrative for men, no matter the circumstance.    \n\nAt the heart of progressive gender ideology is this absurd notion of trickle-down equality - that if we just focus on fixing women\u2019s issues, men\u2019s issues will just magically solve themselves. As time has come to past, it\u2019s clear that this is simply not true. Women have made great strides in almost all sectors of life, whereas men have stagnated or even regressed, usually as the result of questionable social policies created in the name of \u201cequity\u201d. It is now blatantly clear that schools discriminate against male students for the same work compared to women, that universities and employers favour female candidates, and that ironic misandry is tolerated (even encouraged) in the public sphere, but even mentioning this is considered controversial. \n\nProgressives and feminists fundamentally view gender equality as a zero-sum game. Attention and resources given to men\u2019s issues are resources that could be used towards women\u2019s issues. In doing so, they must frame any good-faith opposition to their absurd ideology as right-wing reactionaries (take the \u201cManosphere\u201d for instance - a new buzzword that lumps mass murdering incels with pick-up artists and men\u2019s right\u2019s activists - despite these groups having almost nothing in common). \n\nAll of this goes to show what is essentially tantamount to gaslighting on a global scale. \n\n\u201cThe patriarchy hurts both men and women\u201d - but women\u2019s issues are the only one\u2019s taken seriously, whereas men\u2019s issues are treated with condescension (or ignored). \n\n\u201cBoth genders reinforce harmful gender norms\u201d - but only men are told to change, whereas women are assumed to be perfect.\n\n\u201cWe should encourage men to speak up about gender issues\u201d - but if they do they\u2019ll be labelled a misogynistic incel.\n\n\u201cFeminism is for men\u201d - but feminist organizations actively support blatantly anti-male legislation and policies (eg, UN financing male circumcision in the Third World).\n\nThe progressive hostility towards men\u2019s issues is directly responsible for the rise of people like Andrew Tate, and I fully expect more figures like him to gain popularity in the near future. It\u2019s hard to express just how frustrating it is to see even the most trivial of women\u2019s issues discussed ad-naseum by progressives and mainstream media (eg, female multimillionaire actresses make slightly less than their male counterparts), whereas some of the most egregious human rights violations still being legal to commit against men is totally ignored, or even supported. The progressive failure has obviously reached a tipping point now - red pill content has exploded in popularity over the last year, and when the pendulum swings back, I expect there will be a fierce overcorrection from progressives. Unless progressives become willing to actually discuss men\u2019s issues, things are only going to get worse, but chances of that seem slim.","title":"[Essay] Progressives\/Feminists are bad at talking about men\u2019s issues","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/12bka99\/essay_progressivesfeminists_are_bad_at_talking\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

This male-on-female construct remains the dominant paradigm through which sexual victimization is understood and addressed. [...] **We and other scholars have pressed for an expanded understanding of sexual victimization** (Smith, 2012; Turchik & Edwards, 2012; Stemple, 2009; Denov, 2003a, 2003b). New research findings that run counter to gender stereotypes fuel this imperative. While in no way seeking to minimize the very real phenomenon of male perpetration, we examine female perpetration so as to explore the gender dynamics at play and to understand sexual victimization more fully. In so doing, we argue that new attention to female sexual perpetration serves important feminist goals.\n\nStemple has outdone herself! This lit review is packed with studies and references, including perennial favorites (NISVS, NCVS) as well as excellent lesser-known surveys of perpetration, prisons, and youth. For example:\n\n>A 2012 study using data from the U. S. Census Bureau's nationally representative National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 2001-02) found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u201cever force[d] someone to have sex against their will,\u201d 43.6% were female and 56.4% were male (Hoertel, Le Strat, Schuster, & Limosin, 2012).\n\nReassurances that \"We call for feminist approaches - expansively interpreted\" coexist with ~~sick burns~~ pointed criticism:\n\n>The 2010 and 2011 reports also estimate that men who experienced sexual coercion and unwantedsexual contact were more likely to report female rather than male perpetrators. **Despite this study's own findings**, CDC authors emphasize the prevention of male perpetration (Breiding et al., 2014).\n\n>Perhaps even more troubling than misperceptions concerning female perpetration among the general population are misperceptions held by professionals responsible for addressing the problem. **Female perpetration is downplayed by those in fields such as mental health, social work, public health, and law, as a range of scholars have demonstrated** (Denov, 2001; Saradjian, 1996; Mendel, 1995). Stereotypical understandings of women as sexually harmless can allow professionals to create a \u201cculture of denial\u201d that fails to recognize the seriousness of the abuse (Hetherton, 1999).\n\nCould these misperceptions have something to do with the aforementioned feminist theory blaming sexual violence on \"male power and privilege\"? Do Stemple and Meyer hit a sweet spot between criticizing and placating feminists? Are there any rigorous studies out there contradicting all this evidence of significant (1\/3 to 1\/2) female perpetration of sexual violence in USA?","title":"Sexual Victimization by Women Is More Common Than Previously Known","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/762ucs\/sexual_victimization_by_women_is_more_common_than\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

Some issues- particularly those around reproduction- are informed by different biological realities (being capable of impregnation and being capable of pregnancy are not the same- reproductive freedoms can only aim at comparability, not equivalence).  Women don't worry about disposability, or if they do- they worry about it in a different way than men do.  Men don't worry about being hypersexualized in the same way that women do, because we have different norms that we struggle with that limit our freedoms in different ways.  We have different contexts, and our issues arise from those contexts.  Feminists haven't principally concerned themselves with winning *empathy* for women, they are concerned with winning *respect* for women.  MRAs haven't principally been concerned with getting respect for men- they've been concerned with getting empathy for men (well, that's a bit of a reduction- writers like\/u\/yetanothercommenter spend a lot of time trying to pointing out that the respect that men get is highly conditional).\n\nIMO: the lack of a direct comparison does not mean that an issue isn't real.  It doesn't invalidate other issues, but it's common to act as if they do.  I cringe when I see men's issues reframed as women's issues, or trivialized because other men bear some responsibility for those issues.  I don't understand how things like [this](https:\/\/debunkingmras.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/12\/debunking-the-mens-rights-movement-x\/) aren't an embarassment for people ostensibly interested in gender equity.  Similarly, I know that the distinction between antifeminism and misogyny is an important one that is erased as often as possible by those who want to paint antifeminists in a bad light- but some issues highlighted by feminists aren't feminist issues so much as they are *women's* issues.  I think that almost everyone is more interested in a better future for everyone than they are a gender war, and that an expectation of symmetry creates a bias which can get in the way of that.\n\nSpeaking as a MRA, I find that there are much more compelling arguments to be found in taking something like the male gaze, acknowledging the problems it presents women, and then thinking about it from a male-sympathetic viewpoint (could that cinematic technique play into how we [value the sexuality of men and women](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1ucb0s\/male_sexual_currency_your_moneys_no_good_here\/cegpk99)?  Does it reinforce a cherishable\/disposable dichotomy?)  One of the reasons I find the MRM so interesting is because it really seems to me that there is a feminist tradition which has generally treated masculinity as a (frequently unsympathetic) constitutive other, and that the same material hasn't been examined yet with a masculine center.  To me, that indicates that there are a lot of interesting ideas (particularly interesting to me because they can contribute to my own self-discovery) just waiting to be found, and that it's basically well-demarcated yet unexplored territory.  Feminist criticality doesn't always need to take the form of rejection- sometimes it takes the form of providing additional commentary that can transform the lessons you take from it.  And sometimes feminist-criticality involves just acknowledging that the way an issue is presented is a fair ball.  Discounting legitimate issues can be harmful, and undermines your ability to advocate effectively for other issues which may be closer to your heart.  Obviously which issues I find legitimate and which issues you find legitimate may vary, but a lack of symmetricality doesn't indicate a lack of legitimacy.","title":"Men's Issues and Women's issues are sometimes complimentary, not symmetrical.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/34k80f\/mens_issues_and_womens_issues_are_sometimes\/","upvote_ratio":0.96,"over_18":false}

I thought it would be useful to share some background to you people. \n\nIn a lot of English speaking countries Blackstone was the one who made the definition, him being a 1700s English lawyer, and the local or state law was generally similar to his in the USA. Blackstone and English Common Law defined rape as a crime against a person which was \u201ccarnal knowledge of a woman, by force and against her will.\u201d\n\nThis applied even to unmarried women with no male guardians and children, and was a pretty standardized view of rape. It wasn't seen as a property crime against a male guardian, doing stuff against the woman's will was seen as bad. Rape of men was not considered a crime, except as assault or kidnapping if it were sufficiently violent, or as a homosexual act.\n\nSlaves and black people had laws to punish them in many USA states, of course, and sex workers and children often had their testimony valued less highly and were at risk.\n\nThe Romans understood rape in the light of the idea of stuprum per vim, aka a degradation of the honour of a Roman citizen by use of violence. There were varying attempts to mix in the idea of assault as well. The male guardian would certainly be considered wronged, but even an unmarried woman without a male guardian could be subject to a loss of her dignity. \n\nMarital rape was not cared about of course because it didn't reduce a citizen's honour, and rape of those without what they saw as honour, sex workers and actors, was not viewed as a crime because they had no honour to lose. Forcing a man to penetrate wasn't seen as a crime because it wouldn't reduce a man's honour. \n\nOld laws were bad, but they were pretty bad for men and women, and recognized that women were people with dignity and honour. When critiquing old laws it's better to look at the reality than just make claims about women being property.","title":"Women historically were treated as people, not property","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/11wq17m\/women_historically_were_treated_as_people_not\/","upvote_ratio":0.81,"over_18":false}

This really seems like an extension of the provider role, where men are judged for their usefulness to others. In relationships, men get judged much more by women on how useful they are, than vice versa (while women are judged more on their looks).\n\nI would argue that the male equivalent of 'objectification' is thus not when men are judged primarily as sex objects, but rather when men are judged as providers. Not a limited definition of 'providing' that is just about earning money, but a broader definition which also includes doing tasks for her\/the household, providing safety and being an unemotional 'rock.'\n\nNow, up to a point I'm fine with judging (potential) partners by what they do for their loved one(s) *, but I believe that women are conditioned to demand more from men than vice versa, which is a major cause of gender\/relationship inequality.\n\nSo I think that a proper gender discourse should address both issues, while IMO right now there is too much focus on 'objectification' (& the discourse around that issue is too extreme) and far too little on 'providerification.'\n\n(*) and just the same for looks","title":"Why don't men like fictional romance?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4gyqmu\/why_dont_men_like_fictional_romance\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

I used to be a very active queer activist in my previous country and hence had a lot of ties ideologically with feminism but as well the actual local feminist activist of my country because the two communities are so interwoven. And back then I used to think MRAs are just right wing traditionalist who just want old traditional gender roles back, maybe with a sprinkle of incels. Needless to say that I know now I was very wrong. I nonetheless ponder how I came to think that way about them, and the only answer I can get to is that I just yielded to group think, when it comes to gender politics I was reading only queer\/feminist medias, and I was talking only to my friends, which were queer\/feminist as well, and the \"common knowledge\" is that MRAs are just right wing traditionalist who want old traditional gender role backs, and I never really questioned this common knowledge. So if the topic of MRAs would have came up, I guess I would have passively agreed to the general narrative for a lack of having more information myself.\n\nI see something similar happening with the TERF discourse, where TERFs are just assumed to be just radicals who think transmen are traitors and trans-women actually predators who wants to infiltrate women's spaces, although when watched a couple videos from labelled (by others) TERFs, I actually discovered that they are much more subtle arguments such as just not wanting to be expected to have sex with women which still have a penis and being shamed for not doing so, or not wanting to accept \"trans-women\" who are clearly not making any effort\/move towards actual transition (but still trans-women who are indeed transitioning, or part transition). All these are very different positions than what I usually see people think what the TERF arguments are.\n\nAnd finally I think I see it happening a bit as well in the MRM movement, especially more with the people in the Mensright sub, where there is just this assumption that feminist is just really pro-actively, and the general population, by feminist influence, is passively, against men's rights, where in fact, feminist\/general public is just guilty\/victim of group thinking by lack of education what MRA arguments really are.\n\nThe biggest problem though is that it creates a nasty feedback loop. Feminist\/general population believe (erroneously) that MRAs are right wing\/traditionalist misogynists against women's rights, they end up depicting and distorting MRAs arguments according to that in the general discourse (more out of ignorance and the group think described above rather planned action). MRAs, seeing, feminists completely distorting MRA arguments to the general public, become understandably angry and fixated at feminists. Feminist see MRAs being angry and fixated at them and just deduce it must be because MRAs are misogynists against women's rights, and we're back to the start of the circle","title":"Stereotypes and group thinking in both Feminist and MRM circles and how influences the \"war\" between them","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/lr9x9m\/stereotypes_and_group_thinking_in_both_feminist\/","upvote_ratio":0.95,"over_18":false}

The response is usually that feminism is about how gender roles harm everybody, and that feminism is not about women. My only question in response to this is \"where are they?\"\n\nThere are very very few feminists who make men's issues their primary interest (at least from what I've seen). Most focus on women's issues and make men's issues a secondary side-project. Whenever men's issues are discussed by feminists, it goes one of two ways. They say either \"this issue exists but if you think it's serious or you try to do anything to stop it, you're an evil MRA.\" or \"this issue exists but it's because of patriarchy\/male privilege.\"\n\nOne example of this is male circumcision. I know that most feminists are at least surface-level oppose to circumcision, so I won't claim that feminism is pro-circumcision. I'd like to look at two articles from mainstream (I think) feminist sources: Everyday Feminism and Feministing.\n\nhttp:\/\/everydayfeminism.com\/2016\/05\/mens-rights-circumcision\/. I'll highlight a few paragraphs here\n\n>Other visual props include a stop sign placard that reads, \u201cStop Cutting Babies,\u201d a clear echo of the iconic \u201cStop Abortion Now\u201d signs that have become a hallmark of anti-abortion protests. Other signs read \u201ccircumcision is a sex crime\u201d and \u201csex abusers for hire.\u201d\n\n>Like anti-abortion extremists, who frame their argument around the idea that abortion is murder, intactivist extremists contextualize circumcision as a sex crime to motivate a vigilante-style roundup of criminals.\n\n>Oddly, while mirroring tactics of the extreme right, they simultaneously co-opt marginalized narratives for their own ends. Phrases like \u201cgender equality begins at birth\u201d and \u201chis penis, his choice,\u201d mimicking feminist slogans, can also be found sprinkled amongst intactivist protest signs.\n\nThe article is saying that taking a strong stance against circumcision makes you an extremist and comparable to a right winger.\n\n>Comparing cis men\u2019s \u201cmutilated genitals\u201d to cis women\u2019s \u201cwhole and protected genitals\u201d is a default argument for intactivist extremists as a way to cast circumcision as evidence of men\u2019s oppression.\n\nThis is plain refusal to acknowledge legal genital mutilation as systemic oppression. If it were legal to mutilate girls, they would use that as evidence that women are oppressed, but because it happens to boys it's somehow not oppression.\n\nThe vast majority of the article is just shitting on intactivists and MRAs. The point of this article seems to be \"Circumcision is bad, I guess, so I will give token lip service to bodily autonomy, but if you take a firm and vocal anti-circumcision stance, you're a bad person and you need to shut up.\"\n\nhttp:\/\/feministing.com\/2015\/07\/15\/circumcision-is-a-feminist-issueand-so-is-how-we-talk-about-it\/. The Feministing article is slightly less egregious, so I will just highlight some key phrases.\n\n>Male circumcision is symbolic of men\u2019s power.\n\n>Circumcision has always been symbolically connected to male privilege.\n\n>Medicalizing circumcision also served male power.\n\n>A final point about circumcision\u2019s medical history; it has not only been about male privilege, but white male privilege.\n\n>But, what they are missing is that harm has historically and symbolically been in service of men\u2019s power.\n\n>Circumcision has been American society\u2019s way of readying individual men for group power and privilege.\n\n>circumcision is a feminist issue because circumcision is about patriarchy.\n\n>We must acknowledge its connection to men\u2019s privilege, even as we acknowledge men\u2019s pain.\n\nThis one isn't to do with circumcision but it mirrors the sentiment of the rest of the article.\n\n>Yes, individual men die as soldiers, but the reason they are sent to battle is because society views them as stronger and more courageous, as leaders. It is precisely because we value masculinity that we send men to war.\n\nThe problem here should be very obvious. The author of this article only views circumcision in terms of patriarchy, of male privilege backfiring. They even state that circumcision is done intentionally to privilege men. This is not what compassion looks like. When you want to help somebody with a problem they had no part in creating (Such as circumcision. No baby ever chooses to be circumcised), you do not start by blaming them for their own problems. The article also does its fair share of MRA-bashing.\n\nHere is what I want to see. I want to see feminists start seriously tackling men's issues. I want them to acknowledge male problems without comparing them to female problems. I want them to address the problems without blaming them on patriarchy or saying that the problems are a symptom of male privilege. I want them to acknowledge that men are capable of being systematically oppressed because of their gender. If you can't or won't do this, then stop hurling insults at the people who do and stop claiming that feminists care equally about men and women.\n\nIf you think I'm full of shit and there are tons of feminists who do what I've requested, now is the time to post some links. I want to see these feminsts. The only one I've seen so far is Christina Hoff Sommers. I'm sorry if this post is rambly; If anything is unclear just ask me.","title":"Where are the pro-male feminists I keep hearing about?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/5rjocz\/where_are_the_promale_feminists_i_keep_hearing\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

I'm new to this community and I wanted to take a quick paragraph of my first post here to introduce myself and give a brief explanation of my views on gender politics. I try not to give too many personal details out online. But I am a woman. And I am on the autism spectrum. For most of my life I have identified as a feminist. And I've participated in feminist clubs and several marches. Though recently a couple of my male friends spoke to me about being mistreated by members of another feminist club. This was what pushed me to make this account so that I could research the MRA and Antifeminist perspectives. And what I've found has made me deeply question feminism. I still believe in equality. But I believe that the feminist movement is in great need of reform before it can accomplish this. And the following article explores a large part of why I feel this way. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/233717660_Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment\n\nI finally took the time to sit down and read through this article while having a cup of tea so that I could really digest what it was covering. \n\nBy the time I made it to the end of the first page I found something that was interesting. That being how brazen and abrupt this article is about making it's point about the denial of it's findings. \n\n>The second objective is to document the fact that the deniers of the research\nshowing gender symmetry in PV have dealt with the denied research results by sci\u0002entifically unacceptable tactics such as concealing those results, selective citation of\nresearch, stating conclusions that are the opposite of the data in the results section and intimidating researchers who produced results showing gender symmetry.\n\nThis feels rather shocking for a scientific article. But considering the depth of what this entails I can understand the gravity that would elicit such strong wording. \n\nI also found it interesting that it appears that even the author had begun his research from the opposite perspective. \n\n> Bit by bit, my original assumption that\nPV was about men dominating women has been contradicted by a mass of empirical\nevidence from my own research and from research by many others, which found that\nwomen physically attack partners at the same or higher rate as men and that that\nmale dominance is only one of the many causes.\n\nI also find it interesting that the paper notes that domestic violence is most often reciprocal. And the methodology of how they found this out. \n\n\n>Equal rates of perpetration do not necessarily mean mutuality in the sense of both\npartners engaging in physical attacks. An epidemiological survey might find ahout\nthe same rates for men and women-for example, 12% in the previous 12 months.\nHowever, the 12% of men could refer to one set of couples, and the 12% of women\nmight be occurring in another set of couples. Theoretically, there could be no couples\nwhere both are violent. Again, the analyses in Behind Closed Doors (Straus et al.,\n2006) led the way by developing and presenting statistics that showed that, when\nthere is violence, it is most often mutual. And again, like the results on symmetry in\nperpetration, the profound implications ofthe results on mutuality were not explicitly\ndiscussed in that book. Since then, other studies have also found that, when there is\nPV, it is most often mutual.\n\nThough it also notes that there is differences in how men and women are victimized. Something that feminists have long spoken of.\n\n>Attacks by men cause more injury (both physical and psychological), more deaths,\nand more fear. In addition, women are more often economically trapped in a violent\nrelationship than men, because women continue to earn less than men and because,\nwhen a marriage ends, women have custodial responsibility for children at least 80%\nof the time. On the other hand, the adverse effects of emotional abuse, while not a\nfocus of this article, are often greater than those of physical PV, with a comparable\nimpact on both men and women victims (Hamel, 2009; Lawrence, Yoon, Langer, & Ro,\n2009; Taft et aI., 2006)\n\n>the greater adverse effect on women is one ofthe things that underlie denial of the\nevidence on gender symmetry. However, empathy for women because of the greater\ninjury and the need to help victimized women must not be allowed to obscure the\nfact that men sustain about a third of the injuries from PV, including a third of\nthe deaths from attacks by a partner (Catalano, 2006; Rennison, 2000; Straus,\n2005). PV by women is therefore a serious crime and a health and social problem\nthat must be addressed\n\n\nThe rest of the section talks about the number of factors that go into perpetration of domestic violence and how these factors are often balanced between men and women. This is something that I think is very important but it is not something I can capture as efficiently in a small tidbit like the above. As such I will be moving on to the next section of the article which details the methods of denial of the evidence. \n\nOne of the more interesting things that stands out in this section is the author pointing out his own previous bias. \n\n>The data analysis for my coauthored article on the \"Drunken Bum Theory\nof Wife-Beating\" (Kaufman Kantor & Straus, 1987) included women who were\ndrunken bums as well as men, but the paper submitted for publication included\nonly data on men's drinking and men's violence\n\nThis to me is an incredible sign of intellectual and academic honesty. Any good scientist or researcher should be able to admit that their findings in the past were incorrect. And that this is done more than once by the author of the paper drives me to trust their academic\/intellectual integrity much more than their laundry list of past works. But this is only my opinion. \n\nThere is also this part further down which I found very eye opening wherein the author describes the creation of public bias through the inability of the general public to accurately parse data in research. and instead simply trust what they are told by the researchers who have been found to misrepresent their findings. \n\n>and because most readers of the article are unlikely to carefully examine the tables\nor compare the path coefficients with what is said about them, the erroneous conclu\u0002sions are what will be cited as though they were scientific evidence. From then on,\nthere will be citations such as \"a study by Kemsmith of 60 men and 54 women in a\nbatterer counseling program found differences in males' and females' motivations for\nusing violence,\" even though the article shows similar motives. And because the ar\u0002ticle is in a reputable peer-reviewed journal and has an appropriate sample, readers\nofthe subsequent articles in which that is cited will accept it as a scientific fact.\n\nThere are also more egregious examples of outright biased and academically dishonest practices by institutions further down. The following was rather surprising as I've never seen it brought up. But the clear one sidedness of it is honestly appalling.\n\n>In December 2005, the National Institute of Justice invited grant proposals to inves\u0002tigate PV and sexual violence. It stated that studies involving men victims are not\neligible for funding\n\nI also felt that this was worth including as the irony is almost seeping from the page.\n\n>The most extreme example was the experience of Susan Steinmetz. When she was\nat the University of Delaware and was being reviewed for promotion and tenure,\nthere was an organized attempt to block her appointment through unsolicited letters\nto her department and the university president. They asserted that Steinmetz was\nnot a suitable person to promote because her research showing high rates of wom\u0002en's perpetration of PV was not believable. In short, they accused her of scientific\nfraud\n\n\nI also really enjoyed the section on biased media coverage. As the popular media is something I have long learned to distrust. initially it was through my family but as I went through college a similar message was echoed. So it is nice to see such a thing covered here as well. I honestly also believe that the following should be broadcasted on television before any news report so that the public can be better educated. \n\n>Media coverage is influenced by many things, including the beliefs and perceptions\nof reporters and editors and by what they think will sell papers or increase viewers,\nboth ofwhich have led to biased reporting of crime\n\nThe results of this are mentioned in the following. Which were surprising to me to say the least. \n\n>A study of newspaper coverage of 785 homicides in Cleveland, Ohio, from 1984 to\n1992 (Lundman, 2000) found that, of homicides in which a man killed a woman, 79%\nmade it into the newspaper, whereas only half of homicides in which a woman killed a\nman were covered. Of those that were reported, much more space was given to cases\nof men killing women: an average of 3.6 articles for male homicides of females and\n1.7 articles for female homicides of males. Women kill partners in a third of the in\u0002stances of partner homicides, but the biased coverage makes it seem even more rare\n\nFinally there was something referenced that I've heard echoed across the spheres of MRA's and antifeminists. \n\n>Defense of Feminist Theory. I suggest that one ofthe explanations for denying the\nevidence.an gender symmetry is to defend feminism in general. This is because a key\nstep in the effort to achieve an equalitarian society is to bring about recognition ofthe\nhann that a patriarchal system causes. The removal of patriarchy as the main cause of\nPV weakens a dramatic example of the harmful effects of patriarchy. Any weakening\nof efforts to achieve greater gender equality is unfortunate but by no means critical,\n\nAnd finally. I'd like to finish off my comment with a paragraph from the conclusion of the article as I feel it does an excellent job at getting everybody on board with the necessity of what it promotes. \n\n>It is time to make the effort to end all family violence, not just violence against\nwomen partners, because this is morally and legally necessary and because it is crucial to protect women. This must include PV by women, which is widely viewed as\nmostly harmless (Greenblat, 1983), because physical injury inflicted by women is\nmore rare than physical injury inflicted by men (Stets & Straus, 1990). On the contrary, even when attacks by women result in no physical injury, ending PV by women\nis a basic prevention step to reduce violence against women and all other humans.\nThe research shows that this so-called harmless violence by women because a metanalysis by Stith and colleagues (2004) found that a woman's perpetration of violence was the strongest predictor of her being a victim of partner violence","title":"Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/w81p02\/thirty_years_of_denying_the_evidence_on_gender\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

However It's not all about sex. I don't think it's even mostly about sex. In my nice guy phase, my goal wasn't sex, it was a relationship. If I had been given the choice between 1) sleeping with the woman I was interested in and never seeing her again or 2) dating her but never having sex I would have chosen option 2 every time.\n\nMaybe I'm not representative of all nice guys but I doubt that most are at all interested in one-night-stands.\n\nThere is massive external and internal pressure on men to have female attention. A man's status and, as a result, frequently his self-esteem depends greatly on his success with women. Also, there is a level of emotional connection which men in general cannot get from other men.\n\nAs such, female attention is a major motivator for men in general. Not just \"nice guys\". A great deal of male behavior, whether consciously or not, comes from this. Why is this desire only considered sinister when it is expressed by being nice?\n\nThe explanation seems to be because the niceness comes with strings attached, that the nice guy feels he is entitled to what he desires because he is nice. Again, this makes no sense. If a man goes to the gym every day to perfect his body in order to impress women, does he feel entitled to have sex with them? What about the man who buys a nice suit, or expensive car for the same reason? Why is it only the nice guy who is feeling entitled?\n\nPersonally, I never felt entitled to anything for my being nice. It wasn't a transaction, in crass nature-documentary terms it was a mating display. A mating display can be accepted or rejected and the one performing the display accepts that. They will naturally be disappointed when met with rejection but disappointment does not imply that they felt they were owed anything. In a race, everyone but the winner will feel some disappointment. Does that mean they all felt entitled to victory?\n\nThe only real difference I can see between nice-guy behavior and other types of mating display is that the nice-guy technique is rarely successful. Women tend to label men who make unsuccessful advances as creepy.\n\nFrequently the disappointment \"nice guys\" feel is expressed as complaints about women only wanting jerks. Women generally resent and deny this suggestion but it is an entirely reasonable reaction from the point of view of the nice guy and not totally inaccurate, although it misses some of the complexity.\n\nNice guys repeatedly hear from women that what they want a man who is nice. What they mean is that they want a confident, attractive and successful guy who is nice. They are only considering the men who meet their standards for confidence, attractiveness and success and looking for the guys who are nicest within that group. Women tell him they can't find a nice guy and he's left asking \"what about me?\" unaware that he's been eliminated from the running before niceness is even considered.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with having those standards. It just sets up a situation where the nice guy cannot see why he is compared unfavorably to another guy who isn't as nice.\n\nNice guys are generally men who lack confidence. This is probably the primary reason they are unsuccessful but it is also the reason they choose the nice-guy strategy. They don't feel they have anything to offer women except being nice.\n\nThis is why I am so upset by these attacks on nice guys. Do we build them up so they can be what women actually want? Nope. We kick them while they are down. Shaming them for daring to want a relationship with a woman and eroding the little confidence they have.","title":"Why is there so much hate for \"Nice Guys\"?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2rpl8r\/why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_nice_guys\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

Because I've wondered if it is more accurate to say women are wonderful when (they fulfill certain roles or functions).\n\nI found this paper: [Gender Differences in Automatic In-Group Bias: Why Do Women Like\nWomen More Than Men Like Men?](https:\/\/neo-masculin.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf)\n\nSince that's pretty interesting I'll post the abstract tho only a small aside in the paper interests me at the moment.\n\n> Four experiments confirmed that women\u2019s automatic in-group bias is remarkably stronger than men\u2019s\nand investigated explanations for this sex difference, derived from potential sources of implicit attitudes\n(L. A. Rudman, 2004). In Experiment 1, only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among\nin-group bias, identity, and self-esteem (A. G. Greenwald et al., 2002), revealing that men lack a\nmechanism that bolsters automatic own group preference. Experiments 2 and 3 found pro-female bias to\nthe extent that participants automatically favored their mothers over their fathers or associated male\ngender with violence, suggesting that maternal bonding and male intimidation influence gender attitudes.\nExperiment 4 showed that for sexually experienced men, the more positive their attitude was toward sex,\nthe more they implicitly favored women. In concert, the findings help to explain sex differences in\nautomatic in-group bias and underscore the uniqueness of gender for intergroup relations theorists.\n\nThis is the part that surprised the researches and I think explains something that has baffled me.\n\n> Thus, men supported our\nexpectation that if they associated women with sex (through sexual\nencounters that likely lead to emotional conditioning), they would\nprefer women to the extent they liked sex. By contrast, men low on\nsexual experience implicitly disliked women to the extent they\nliked sex.\n\n\n> Although we did not expect the latter result, in hindsight it\nsupports emotional conditioning as a source for implicit attitudes.\nA plausible interpretation is that men who like sex and have their\nsexual needs fulfilled by women tend to automatically favor\nwomen, whereas men who want but are deprived of sex may\nimplicitly resent women. That is, if we assume that sexual gratification (or its absence) is an affective experience for men, the\n506 RUDMAN AND GOODWIN\npattern of results is not surprising. **Moreover, this interpretation\ncoheres with Glick and Fiske\u2019s (1996) argument that men may\nexpress benevolence toward women because they depend on them\n(e.g., for sexual relations). If women are not forthcoming, their\ndyadic power over men may backfire, resulting in implicit sexism**\n\nSo, I've sometimes wondered why men who apparently loathe women seem hyperfocused on sex.  Like Incels.  I'm wondering now if it's no more complicated than that's the way people roll. That it's a type of bias that is difficult for the person experiencing it to analyze. \n\nI also agree with the bolded part which I think relates to \"women are wonderful **when**\".  It also seems to me that the power women have as the gate keepers of sex isn't empowering.\n\nSo, I guess I wonder if I'm alone in seeing a hostility towards women from men in certain circumstances.\n\nDoes this type of bias, dislike of a group seen as withholding what another group wants, show up in other circumstances.\n\nDo you agree women are wonderful only when.....\n\nAnd, finally, given that a lot of people feel empathy for the suffering of men who feel angry and bereft of sex and companionship, how would knowledge of this type of bias assist in helping them?\n\nEdit:  women who like sex also like men better too. \ud83d\udc40","title":"Women are wonderful when....","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/nsj16e\/women_are_wonderful_when\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

I call it Silence Culture but feel free to debate any other acceptable semantics.\n\nI believe Warren Farrell described it partly already, and I'm pretty sure any hetero guy will confirm it, there is this hidden expectation for men to do the pick up\/courting process without never ever saying\/asking out loud what their actual desire is, in the particular case of potential hook up, sex, in order to not break the mood. \n\nFor a more illustrative example, I'm a transman and my biggest worry in the flirting\/pick-up process is not being rejected in the first part based on my appearance\/character, if anything, it's actually going to the stage where said lady is probably interested in going back home. I've transitioned nearly 10 years ago so I present fully despite not having a bottom surgery, and hence having the original plumbing down there, I hence need to disclose to my potential future hook up what she is going to get. A clear discussion about my genitalia is unavoidable. Here comes the problem, me talking about how I am down there directly signals that I want to have sex with said lady and it's an actual serious discussion which requires her to think more deeply about the implication of it, and ultimately what she wants to do. It is the kind of discussion which is not sexy by itself, a total mood breaker. I feel like the  serious discussion itself about our expectation of possible future casual sex (independently of the problematic of being trans now) is a no go, asking after some heavily flirting in a bar: \"hey, I really like you, would you like to come back to mine and have sex?\" is shooting oneself in the foot, when it should not be. And even afterwards, once in the cab, or in the couch back home, asking \" Do you wanna have sex?\". Any of those healthy questions will get you on a scale of at best a bit weird to eventually creepy.\n\nOne of my very woke\/feminist friend actually tried it, ask, all the time, and even him, the most loud liberal person I know of (and I evolve in liberal circles), came back with the conclusion, that is just does not work at all, even for a relatively good looking guy, who is very good at speaking.\n\nHere comes the double bind, in general men are the ones expected to pro-actively seek consent, however in the current dating culture they are expected to basically \"mind read\" until they get to the actual sex. No one right in their mind will adopt a strategy (asking directly) not matter how right it is in theory, which will result in higher failure rates. But that's basically what we are asking of men nowdays.\n\nHere comes the more uncomfortable bit, hetero-women, as the selecting class (currently), is the one enforcing this culture. There are the ones which gets to decide which male behaviour is successful or not. And males, as a class, will adopt the behaviours which will get them success. I've heard in a lot of spaces \"consent is sexy\" often directed at men, I feel they're missing their target, I feel women really are the ones which need to learn that men asking consent are sexy. \n\nI'm bisexual, and I can tell you from experience, that if men are in an environment where they are allowed to(gay community), they will cut through all the indirect bullshit, state clearly what they want\/would like to do and just ask (consent) nicely.","title":"Silence culture in dating","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/kou7zx\/silence_culture_in_dating\/","upvote_ratio":0.98,"over_18":false}

Some were enlightening, some were tiresome. The consensus among many feminists seems to be that, while some men may be disadvantaged in some instances, these are not instances of men qua men being discriminated against. What is more, the corresponding advantage for women is not seen as a privilege since this is a concept reserved for the disadvantages that oppressed groups are facing. It is women, not men who are oppressed, ergo women are not privileged.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's a somewhat archetypical example of the argument:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [...] men, as a group, do not face systematic oppression because of their gender. Am I saying that literally no men out there are oppressed? No, I am for sure not saying that. Men can and do face oppression and marginalization for many reasons \u2013 because of race, class, sexuality, poverty, to name a few. Am I saying that every white cishet dude out there has an amazing life because of all his amassed privilege? Nope, I\u2019m not saying that either. There are many circumstances that might lead to someone living a difficult life. But men do not face oppression because they are men. Misandry is not actually a thing, and pretending that it\u2019s an oppressive force on par with or worse than misogyny is offensive, gross, and intellectually dishonest. [...] You know what\u2019s actually to blame for a lot of these issues? Marginalizing forces like class and race, for one thing \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s not rich white men who are grappling with homelessness or dangerous workplaces or gun violence. You know what else is to blame? Our patriarchal culture and its strictly enforced gender roles which, hey, happens to be exactly the same power structure that feminism is trying to take down.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom: http:\/\/bellejar.ca\/2014\/03\/28\/why-the-mens-rights-movement-is-garbage\/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI would like to assert that this idea stems from a rather simplistic understanding of intersectionalist thought. In the following, I will attempt to explain why, and present a more comprehensive alternative that much better serves the goal of obtaining gender equality.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote: This has gotten quite long. I have added TL;DRs to the individual sections.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# 1) Male disadvantage and discrimination as reverse-privilege, smashing the patriarchy\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen the discussion comes to disadvantages that men are often facing (e.g. involuntary military service, or the sentencing gap in the US), some feminists respond by saying that this is simply the flip side of male privilege. The phrase \"patriarchy backfiring\" is often uttered in this context. In essence, it is the idea that the underlying cause of the disadvantage is a social idea that is also responsible for a heap of male disadvantages. In the case of military service, one could argue that this institution is tied to the idea that men are capable and useful - a notion benefiting them in many other instances.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis insight is often coupled with the advice to join the feminist cause and help them to \"smash the patriarchy\". The problem here is that (many) feminists seem to equivocate between at least two different meanings of patriarchy. Patriarchy is seen as a) a social system in which gender expectations and stereotypes exist that harm both men and women, and b) a social system in which men are privileged and call the shots while women are oppressed and disadvantaged. The appropriate response to Patriarchy A is to tackle these stereotypes and expectations individually and try to establish egalitarian standards wherever possible. The appropriate response to Patriarchy B is to take privileges away from men and establish compensatory systems for women. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nImagine a man upset about his having been subjected to the male-exclusive draft. He seeks to remedy this situation and is consequently told to support the feminist movement in order to get rid of Patriarchy A (the cause of his troubles). This movement, however, mainly focuses on Patriarchy B, and seeks, say, to establish policies like fixed gender quotas for high-status professions. In essence, in trying to combat a discriminative policy, our man would then be expected to fight for policies that disadvantage him further. Doesn't this seem slightly kafkaesque to you?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut apart from the asserted relation between a disadvantage and a corresponding privilege often being hazy at best, I think there are several other things wrong with thinking about male disadvantages as reverse-privileges.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst of all, men are treated as a homogeneous group in which every member has the same access to the same set of privileges. For example, it is often argued that the sentencing gap (men being incarcerated more often and for a longer time than women who committed the same crimes) and the respect gap (men being taken more seriously in formal workplace settings like meetings) have the same root cause: the presumption of male agency. In a way, it is implied, the disadvantage men face is somehow offset by the corresponding advantage. Now, take a black man from a poor neighbourhood. All of these three characteristics (male, black, low socioeconomic status) contribute to him being at a much higher risk of being incarcerated than if he were either female, white, or rich. In what way does it help him that men might be taken more seriously in boardroom meetings? The privileges of a tiny subset of men do not translate to a global advantage for men everywhere. Not, this is not simply a matter of class or race disadvantage. Yes, we will come to a discussion of intersectionalism in a minute.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSecond, it is often assumed that the disadvantage is a *necessary* effect of the corresponding privilege. However, if it is possible to remove an unfair disadvantage, one should do so. One should not have to wait until unfair social institutions that are loosely related are removed as well. In other words: being upset about the draft, arguing about its unfairness, and seeking to dismantle it is a legitimate course of action even if one does not simultaneously seek to increase the number of women in boardrooms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThird, the reverse-privilege argument often comes across as empty sophistry. Even if this is not its intended use, this argument often functions in a way that diminishes the lived experiences of disadvantaged men and silences the voices speaking out against the social institutions that put them at a disadvantage. It also comes very close to blaming the victim. Let me explain my points with a gender-swapped example. Imagine a woman being denied a job because the employer has fears relating to her becoming pregnant. Imagine we told this woman that the regrettable disadvantage she faced was really the flip side of the female privilege of being seen as the primary care-giver of children. Imagine we further told her that this role was tied to a number of disadvantages for men: them having a harder time obtaining custody, them often being seen as creepy when interacting with strange children, them being regarded with suspicion when working with children etc. So really, she should stop complaining and join the cause of fighting for male custody rights.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, if you reject the above argument (I know I do), but insist on using the reverse-privilege argument in other instances, you need to have a good reason why. This reason, I suspect, would probably relate to the assertion that women are a oppressed group in Western societies, while men aren't. Which brings me to my second point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR: Explaining social disadvantages faced by men by relating to them as reverse-privileges or \"the patriarchy backfiring\" does not a good social theory make. The connection between the disadvantage and the privilege is often unclear, and in practice, the notion diminishes male experiences of oppression.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# 2) The oppression\/oppressed binary, mono-directional vectors of oppression\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe main achievement of intersectionalist theory was to point out that simple dichotomies (male\/female, black\/white, hetero-\/homosexual etc.) are not sufficient to explain all dimensions of social oppression and disadvantage. A gay black person may face issues that neither non-black gay people nor non-gay black people face. There might be a different quality of peril at the intersection between these two identities. Now, as important as it is to regard the multiple dimensions and intersections of social disadvantage, advocates of intersectionalism often do not go far enough in analysing the complexities of social roles. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn particular, many intersectionalists seem to treat the vectors of oppression as monodirectional. They may take into account many dimensions in their analysis, but each dimension represents a simple binary. Men are privileged, women are oppressed; whites are privileged, people of colour are oppressed; heterosexuals are privileged, homosexuals are oppressed; etc. Because this dichotomous model doesn't allow for multidirectional vectors of discrimination and oppression, any given class is either privileged or oppressed, while its inverse always occupies the opposite state. Men can only be oppressed if one of their other identities can be said to be a causal factor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, some intersectionalists go to rather great lengths to protect this binary. In discussions about male disadvantages, such as the sentencing gap, or involuntary military service, it is often asserted that these issues are representative of class oppression, not of systemic discrimination based on gender. What is done here is that a mitigating factor such as access to monetary resources is interpreted as being the decisive factor in the equation. Now, while it is true that some rich men may have access to tools that allow them to reduce some of these factors (it is arguably be more easy for rich men to dodge the draft or to pay for a good lawyer), this does not mean that men are not subjected to systemic discrimination qua their being men. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst, using these tools is still costly. If you have to pay for an expensive lawyer in order to offset the function of a discriminatory institution, then you are still being discriminated against. You are simply transforming the cost of the discrimination to you - in this case, from time spent in prison to money spent on lawyers. Second, being male is still the decisive factor for both examples. Where the draft is in place, men of all classes are subjected to it, while women of all classes are not (Israel is the only exception of which I am aware, and even here, men have to serve for a longer period of time). The sentencing gap seems to be stable across socioeconomic milieus as well. Third, even if a discriminatory practice only applied to individuals with the intersecting identities 'male' and 'other identity', this doesn't make the problem any less of a gendered issue. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAgain, let me illustrate my last point by using a gender-swapped example. Let's suppose a study finds out that obese women are subject to fat discrimination much more often than obese men. Would you argue that this is not a gendered issue since slim women aren't facing this problem? Would anybody put forward the argument that \"fatphobia trumps gender\" and insist on gender not being a decisive factor here? Why do people do it the other way around then? Whenever we are dealing with disadvantages that are exclusively located at the intersection of two identities, *both* identities are a factor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR: The simplistic idea that any given social identity group can either be oppressed or privileged (but not both) gives birth to a framework that does not allow for instances in which members of the \"oppressor group\" face oppressive social structures qua their being a member of said group. The model is ridiculously underequipped to explain these instances in a meaningful way and has to handwave them away.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# 3) A simplistic understanding of oppression and power\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf one wants to uphold the assertion that women cannot be privileged because of their oppression, one has to ask by what metric oppression is measured. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI can not overstate how hard it is to find a workable definition of what feminists actually mean when they talk about oppression. Most of the time, the concept of oppression (of women by men) appears as an unsupported assertion, the presumption of which is then used to prove its existence. Seriously, the best summary I could find was this one:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttp:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/feminist-power\/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nand even that article plunges into non-committal, obscurantist gibberish at every second turn. Oppression very rarely appears as a *testable* and *falsifiable* social theory, it is almost always presumed as given. But enough about my frustrations. As far as I can tell, most feminist conceptions of oppression seem to fall into one of two categories, one relating to the sum total of structural obstructions or disadvantages one social group faces, the other relating to the fact that people in positions of power tend to be recruited from certain social groups disproportionally often (vulgo: white men have all the power).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first view was expressed refreshingly clearly by Ann E. Cudd in her book \"Analysing Oppression\". Her position is summarised nicely in this review:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Ultimately, Cudd defines oppression as \"the existence of unequal and unjust institutional constraints\" (Cudd, 52). These constraints involve harm to at least one group on the basis of a social institution that redounds to the benefit of another social group. This harm comes about through coercion, or the use of unjustified force (Cudd, 25). Institutionally structured constraints include \"legal rights, obligations and burdens, stereotypical expectations, wealth, income, social status, conventions, norms, and practices\" (Cudd, 50).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps:\/\/ndpr.nd.edu\/news\/25211-analyzing-oppression\/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, how do we determine oppression? Is there a threshold at which the burden caused by these constraints becomes oppressive? Then the model would certainly allow for men and women to be oppressed, albeit in different ways. However, Cudd seems to hold on to a oppressor\/oppressed dichotomy. If women are oppressed, men must be the oppressor group. Now, how does one determine which group is oppressed and which group is the oppressor if one doesn't just want to presume it? One would have to actually evaluate the burden of the constraints faced by each group, of course!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote that if one accepts this view, one forfeits the possibility to dismiss a priori the constraints that are faced by men as non-oppressive. Very crudely put: If oppression is determined by tallying the unfair burdens faced by each social group, then one has to take them into account before the verdict is given. Otherwise it would be like saying \"Well, Barcelona scored 4 goals in this game and Madrid 5, but the latter clearly don't count because Barcelona won the game, as evidenced by them scoring 4 valid goals more than Madrid\". Yet I encounter this amazing display of circular reasoning quite often when male disadvantage is discussed. The existence of male disadvantage can't possibly be due to systemic oppression, the argument goes, since men are not an oppressed group, as is evidenced by the lack of them facing systemic oppression! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, for the sake of argument, let's say that we have actually come to the conclusion that the burden of constraints faced by women is heavier than those faced by men (I think that this is actually true, by the way). Why would that lead to us calling the constraints faced by men non-oppressive? The burden faced by women doesn't erase the constraints faced by men by one bit. It doesn't make having to spend time in jail any less horrible. It doesn't make an involuntary soldier's life any less terrifying. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, why exactly is it so important to be able to call a homeless man a member of the oppressor class and Hillary Clinton a member of the oppressed? What insight do we gain from this? Unless you wanted to diminish male experiences, keep a scoreboard for political reasons, or have a good excuse for animosity towards men, I really don't see the point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am simply not a big fan of the oppressor\/oppressed model. It encourages a victimhood competition, promotes the notion of gender relations as a zero-sum game, and dampens compassion for the plight of the respective opposite sex. Rejecting the idea that oppression is a binary would really do wonders for working towards a more egalitarian society, but let me come to this in a bit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo far, I feel like I haven't done a good enough job to present the 'male oppressor' view in a good light. So let us take a look at the strongest argument in its favour: That most high-profile positions of power are occupied by men. This is undeniably true, but what exactly follows from this observation? Certainly, the president of the United States being a black man does by no means mean that black people in the US are not subjected to oppressive social structures. The same is true for men. People seem to assume that powerful men seem to play for \"team men\", when in reality, they most often play for \"team me\". It is not men who have all the power, it is a tiny elite of people who have all the power. A majority of these people is male, but they certainly don't have the interests of all men in mind!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPowerful men are simply not interested in helping other men, and, in fact, have a lot to gain by looking women-friendly: Women are the biggest voting bloc in Western states, and companies have a lot of social capital to gain by establishing female-friendly policies. There are actually quite a few instances of powerful men working on social rules that favour women and disadvantage men. Male politicians advocating for and voting in favour of fixed gender quotas for glamorous positions, for example. And, of course, a political decision that sends men to die in trenches is oppressive no matter if the person signing off on it is male or not. The homeless man gains nothing from there being a man in the white house.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBear with me for a little counter-factual thought experiment here: Is a state possible in which a small number of men shape society in such a way that screws over the majority of men while women are, on average, better off? If so, then female oppression does not necessarily follow from institutional power being largely in the hands of men. Yes, this would of course be a class issue as well, but not only. If a male governor promotes an incarceration state that primarily screws over men, then this is not only a matter of an oppressive institution working on the dimensions of race and class, it is *also* a gendered issue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, I think that the discussed view on power is over-emphasizing institutional, \"hard\" power, and neglecting the soft power of social norms. Now, many feminists have embraced the idea of focusing the discussion on gender equality on social mores. Since formal gender equality seems to be largely achieved in the West, this makes a lot of sense. In fact, the only instances where formal inequality persists (e.g. conscription and rape laws) seem to put men at a disadvantage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, for a movement so keen on discussing the pervasive power of social mores and norms, feminism as a whole seems to be largely blind when it comes to their genesis. Especially with the role women play in child care and education, it seems foolish to pretend that women are *not* heavily involved in establishing and perpetuating social mores. But if gender relations are to a large extent governed by these norms, and women are heavily involved in preserving them, then the binary oppressor-oppressed narrative falls flat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR: Oppression is usually not very well defined. The oppression of women by men is often simply presumed as a given. Arguments in support of a binary oppressor\/oppression structure are often circular. The actual world is too complex to be accurately described by such a simplistic binary. To presume that women are oppressed and men are privileged because most positions of power are occupied by men is to promote a simplistic perspective on social dynamics as a zero-sum team sport.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# 4) An alternative way to think about oppression\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn fact, I would argue that it is entirely possible for two distinct social groups to oppress each other and themselves. I would further argue that there can be oppression without an oppressor. Take the stereotype \"men don't cry\". It forces men into adopting a stoic fa\u00e7ade, possibly leading to mental health problems and contributing to the large number of male suicide victims. The inversion of the trope, of course, transports the notion that women are fragile and emotional, which may lead to them being seen as a worse fit for leadership roles. Why do we need an oppressor-oppressed binary here? Why do we have to frame one group's advantages and disadvantages as privilege and \"side effects of privilege\", respectively, while we label the other group's disadvantages as \"oppression\" and handwave the advantages away? \n&nbsp;\n\nA multi-dimensional, multi-directional model of oppression allows for a much more precise analysis of power relations, it doesn't promote victimhood competitions, and facilitates more amicable gender relations based on mutual compassion. It would help us acknowledge other people's vulnerabilities without worrying about the other team scoring against us. It would help us to unite, whereas the binary model only divides.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR: The binary model of oppression sucks. It doesn't offer any valuable insights and only promotes discord. Acknowledging that both sexes can be subject to gender-specific oppressive constraints offers a much more comprehensive view of social dynamics and promotes mutual compassion.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# 5) Questions\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are some of the questions I have. They are basically intended as a conversation starter. I would appreciate any kind of feedback.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- 1) Is the above a fair account of feminist thought or am I strawmanning? If so, how and where? And what would a more accurate account look like?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- 2) Are there any flaws in the arguments presented above? To what notion would you object?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- 3) What advantages does the binary model of oppression have over the multi-dimensional, multi-directional one? Can you make a strong case for the mono-directional model?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- 4) Why do many feminists insist on the binary model of oppression? Why is it so important not to call the constraints faced by men oppressive?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- 5) Suppose a large number of activists (feminist and non-feminists alike) adopted the multi-directional model described above, how would the conversation change? Would it change for the better?

This (long) post is going to be about how I decided to join this community, ending up with a question.\n\nI\u2019m a 50-something man in London. Middle class, white, attractive enough. For most of my life, without thinking about it too much, I\u2019ve called myself a feminist. Retweeted #HeForShe. I didn\u2019t always get the arguments I\u2019d see advanced by feminists in the media (what actually is wrong with the principle of equal pay for work of equal value?), and it seemed the concerns were often very middle class when the middle class women I knew were doing fine, but I liked the idea of equality, that everyone should be free to be who they want to be. The history was very clear and I remember one quiet pause during a dinner party when I was about 25 when I realised that every female friend from university who\u2019d come to London had been subject to some kind of sexual assault like flashing or groping on the tube. How could one not be a feminist? Also, I will say that for more than a decade I owned and ran a medium-sized company, and about half the senior staff were women, and despite having many young women on the staff, I never made a pass at anyone. In short, in middle-class London around the turn of the century I tried to be a good person.\n\nAnd then about 15 years ago I met the woman who would become my wife. You could not be any more in love than we were. But it was not all plain sailing. It turned out she had been sexually abused by her father and raped as a student. With her encouragement, I succeeded in getting her father out of her life but over time she became resentful and then controlling. The love I had for her, the commitment of the vows, my stoicism were used against me. Looking back I can see it started with the silent treatment and moved on to full-on gaslighting and manipulation of the body. She hit me once. As she admitted at the end, she lied her way through years of couple therapy; the truth was she got a kick out of seeing how completely she could control me. She had earlier daughters and they were drawn into it. It was like living with the mean girls from school. When I explained to my own children why we were leaving, I said it was like being married to a frenemy.\n\nPart of this campaign was a constant undermining. And in that her most effective weapon was feminism. I would hesitate to describe my wife as a feminist, and certainly she had no interest in activism. But as time went by, the more she brought up the oppression of women, society\u2019s misogeny, patriarchy. She would return frequently to the idea that men regarded women as prey. Knowing what she had suffered, you would have to have a heart of stone not to sympathise. But there was a lot of the crimes of \u201cmen\u201d in general. As the only man around, I was invited to apologise, and so another evening would pass. It was very effective at keeping me on the back foot.\n\nI got out from that about three years ago and recently started dating again. I follow some people on Twitter who tweet about that, including Binx, and her retweets led me to an account called men\\_are\\_human. Scrolling back through this guy\u2019s tweets (it seems to always have the same voice), I found them raw, exasperated, and often hitting my own buttons. To sum up his position, I\u2019d say he wants i) the basic dignity of men to be respected; ii) compassion for the suffering of men; iii) an end to forms of inequality that disadvantage men. In this, he sees the biggest obstacle as feminism, which appears to him as a massive dominating bloc. What I experienced in my own life, feminism being used to bully and control me, he sees at the social scale. From memory, some of his topics:\n\n* That feminist organisations undermine International Mens Day by trying to turn it into a day about women\u2019s suffering, including the UN\u2019s #HeForShe and by launching a day for women entrepreneurs on the same day\n* That the genital mutilation of boys should be treated with the same horror as that of girls\n* A visceral insistence that women are capable of violence and abuse\n* Calling out misandry\n* That women have been schooled to treat men as a general and ever-present threat.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I think about the circumcision thing, but even if I disagree his position is not mad. It has an obvious logic to it. Otherwise, these all strike a chord with me.\n\nmen\\_are\\_human wants, in effect, to fight a war on Wikipedia to get a swathe of pages re-written and freed from, as he sees it, feminist control. An example is the one on Men Going Their Own Way. For 20 years I have off and on contributed edits to Wikipedia, so I was intrigued and took a look. The page starts like this:\n\n\u201cMen Going Their Own Way (MGTOW \/\u02c8m\u026a\u0261ta\u028a\/) is an anti-feminist, misogynistic, mostly online community advocating for men to separate themselves from women and from a society which they believe has been corrupted by feminism.\u201d\n\nThis was quite a shock. Partly because men\\_are\\_human is frequently at pains to explicitly assert that he is anti-misogyny and not against feminism per se, partly because I was expecting to find a page describing a group that is for men but instead found one describing a group that is against women. So, I went to Google Scholar to look at the research. Question 1: Is MGTOW misogynist? Given the dispute over the authoring on Wikipedia, I was keen to find my own sources and the article I ended up being most interested in was a master\u2019s thesis that had a clear and, to me, neutral methodology for examining the subreddit r\/MGTOW, [\u2018Female Nature, Cucks, and Simps\u2019: Understanding Men Going Their Own Way as part of the Manosphere](https:\/\/www.diva-portal.org\/smash\/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1331052&dswid=1156). I don\u2019t think the author, Zhan\u00e9 Hunte (literally, no idea whether this is a man or a woman), could be accused of misogyny-hunting and is interested in the men as men, for example including quite an interesting discussion of hegemonic as opposed to inclusive masculinity in the subreddit.\n\nHunte\u2019s answer to my question? Yes, MGTOW is misogynist. So my conclusion is that even though men\\_are\\_human\u2019s basic wants are reasonable, there\u2019s a lack of ethical due diligence there. For all I know, MGTOW is as Wikipedia describes it. At this point I look for scholarly articles trying to sketch a basis for common ground and reconcilliation between feminism and the mens groups. I don\u2019t find any. Being a practical person, I then look for somewhere where it might be possible to make some progress. And so I end up here. I hope I\u2019ve found the right place.\n\nMy question is, is there a manifesto anywhere for this kind of reconcilliation or, even better, a framework for achieving it? For example, this community bans derogatory generalisations about any group.

The CEO of Egard watches put together a responding [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/x_HL0wiK4Zc) that focus a lot on the statistics showing that point to men suffering in society in a way that is positive in regards to masculinity as a part of men.  In an [op-ed](https:\/\/www.westernjournal.com\/ceo-risked-everything-stand-gillettes-ad\/) about why he made the video, the CEO has this to say about why he disliked the Gillette ad and what he wanted from his ad:\n\n>The Gillette ad rubbed me the wrong way. I, like the overwhelming majority of men, am absolutely disgusted by sexual assault, rape, bullying, so why throw it in my face as if my \u201cgender\u201d as a whole is toxic? Using terms like \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d is using too broad a stroke to address specific issues \u2014 issues which I agree very much need to be addressed, especially after all the crazy stuff we\u2019ve seen in Hollywood.\n\n...\n\n>My belief is that if you want to \u201cmake men better,\u201d as Gillette claims it wants to do, then the best way to do that is to show the best of us, not the worst. When I see a man risking his life running into a burning building, it makes me want to be better. When I see a father who will stand by his kids no matter what, it makes me want to be better. When I see a soldier putting everything on the line to preserve my freedom, I want to be better. That\u2019s what a man is to me and they represent a far greater majority of men than what Gillette portrayed a man to be.\n\n>I don\u2019t feel I want to be better when an ad starts off with \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d or a bunch of boys bullying each other and portraying men as caricatures of sexual deviants. I simply close off. Call me triggered, say I \u201cmissed the point\u201d but it was my visceral response to seeing it.\n\n-------------\n\nWhile risking getting essentialist, I'll add a caveat that I'm talking in generalities so this doesn't apply to everyone and isn't unique to either gender.  Men and women can both be affected by shame, but there is evidence that men are motivated in many ways by the competing impacts of respect vs shame.  As a veteran therapist speaking to a group of therapists is [quoted](https:\/\/menscenter.org\/shame\/):\n\n>\u201cYou know, first, it\u2019s really not hurt, fear, and shame; hurt doesn\u2019t go so deep; it doesn\u2019t sear like fear or shame. And second, it\u2019s really not fear and shame, it\u2019s fear of shame.\u201d\n\nFrom the same source:\n\n>So, many men not only have been regularly shamed, but they live in the incessant anxiety that they\u2019ll be further shamed. They live in fear of embarrassment, intimidation, humiliation. They are watchful, guarded, vigilant, they keep their distance, they act much more confident than they really are to avoid further shame. When they are shamed, they act out in their own bullying, abuse, and violence to deal with it or avoid it.\n\n>Men go through life as if they\u2019re on patrol in a war zone, and they never know when they might get ambushed. Because they\u2019re so frequently ridiculed and mocked and bullied in their daily lives, they come to see the world as a deeply unsafe place. Brene Brown points out that, over their lifetimes, when men are repeatedly shamed they either get pissed off or they shut down, and sooner or later, some way, some how, some time, many of them explode.\n\nNow, marketing has made a weapon out of using shame to get people to make purchase and that has been turned on men and women alike.  But the underlying message of 'toxic masculinity' that was used in the ad is about shining a light on the core of masculinity in the hopes that highlighting the less desired portions will lead to them being socially eschewed, but there isn't a way to do this without invoking shame.  Instead of holding up a high standard and daring men to live up to it, it sets a bar and demands that men not only surpass that bar themselves but police the same behavior in other men.\n\n-------------\n\nThis brings me to the second part, the behavior shown in the Gillette ad and the general shape of advocacy around 'toxic masculinity'  reflects the feminine approach to social networks and not the masculine.  Men tend to form tight social circles with a variety of meshed hierarchies (based on various relative abilities), and it is within those circles that men build enough trust to be able to infringe on the individuality of each other without challenging the respect of the person.  Social capitol doesn't matter as much as saving face in front of a band of brothers.  In contrast, women tend to form broader but looser social networks that are made up of the tight knit group of close friends and extending out to subsequently looser connections.  For women, it is the social capitol within the network that acts to control behavior since social cohesion or harmony matters more than any individual saving face.\n\nThe result of this difference is that men are primarily responsible for themselves with some ability to influence those in their immediate group.  Trying to influence someone outside of that group would be an assault on the individuality of the other man and is likely to be seen as a personal offense, even if both men agree on the intervention.  So a man that is challenged to step up and do something to fix society will look to themselves and those in their close group and, finding none of the toxic behavior present, says \"what more is there for me to do?\".  But the push in the Gillette ad and things like HeforShe is a call for men to apply social pressure to any man that is misbehaving, in essence the feminine approach to social pressure.\n\n-----------\n\nTL:DR  Part of the issue with the Gillette ad and the 'toxic masculinity' activism it is itself an unhealthy application of shame instead of respect, but also that the solution it advocate represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how men interact with each other by trying to solve the problem in the way that women would.\n","title":"Shame vs respect and the way men interact.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/ahp6hq\/shame_vs_respect_and_the_way_men_interact\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

I've edited it to be more palatable here.** \n\nWhen some feminists address the crisis of men or masculinity, their boilerplate answer is 'men need more feminism to get rid of their toxic masculinity and update their role to a new society where gender roles are no longer the same'.\n\nFor example. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/think\/opinion\/father-s-day-men-are-experiencing-crisis-masculinity-solution-more-ncna884051\n\nMy problem with this logic is that it won't help men to find romantic and sexual companionship from women. At the end of the day, much of what men do is to find female companionship, whether it's Chad who wants to slay pussy like a champ or it's someone else who wants to find his one and only true love and everything in between these two extremes.\n\nI believe that being more feminized and being more like women won't help men in this pursue because women still value traditionally masculine men. The example of androgynous teen popstars is not a valid one: those people are famous and status and celebrity are definitely traits pertaining to the essence masculinity. Getting to the top requires that kind of competitivity that is one of the core elements of traditional masculinity.\n\nBut some feminists seem to be oblivious to that. I'm not sure if it's because they believe in the almighty power of socialization and they think we can fix sexual preferences in a couple of generations with the right amount of social conditioning (something I can't really agree with) or it's because they don't really care about men anyway.\n\nHowever one thing you can easily observe is that whenever they argue that men should drop their toxic masculinity, they never acknowledge how women are responsible for creating TM in the first place with their sexual preferences. Providing qualities like confidence, self-reliance, assertiveness, stoicism and even physical strength is not easy per se but the stressful competition to be the best provider of the above mentioned things is what creates TM or at least it's what some feminists believe and I can get behind that to an extent.\n\nYou would expect to see each and every article or debate condemning toxic male behaviors to be associated with pleas asking women to change their tastes in men and start showing a real interest in those who don't possess traditional masculine core values\/qualities: they should exhort professionally successful women to look for partners who earn substantially less than them or who are even jobless so they could rely on a stay at home father to raise children and focus on their career. They should encourage tall women to look for shorter men, they should encourage women to actively initiate with strangers etc. All I've seen so far are complaints of a lack of 'eligible' men for successful women in urban areas. It's like they don't want to give up anything.","title":"Why don't more feminists address the role of women in causing toxic masculinity and ask them to radically change their preferences in men?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/8wi0w5\/why_dont_more_feminists_address_the_role_of_women\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

Also gone is their acknowledgement of a \u201chistorical debt to feminist-inspired scholarship on gender\u201d.\n\nThis in my view largely seems a positive step, though as the article also notes:\n\n> It is not clear from the mission statement how soon \u2013 if ever - corresponding changes will be made to the APA Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men, but I eagerly await news of such changes. ... The APA view of masculinity has been much criticised not because of their previous mission statement, but because of the Guidelines on working with boys and men, first published in August 2018.\n\nI'm curious if you think that this marks the beginning of any substantial change in the society's approach or just tinkering about the edges.

We used these data to examine the prevailing assumption that men rarely experience sexual victimization. We concluded that federal surveys detect a high prevalence of sexual victimization among men\u2014in many circumstances similar to the prevalence found among women. We identified factors that perpetuate misperceptions about men\u2019s sexual victimization: reliance on traditional gender stereotypes, outdated and inconsistent definitions, and methodological sampling biases that exclude inmates. We recommend changes that move beyond regressive gender assumptions, which can harm both women and men.\n\nReasons proposed for the paradigm that men rape and women are raped include a belief that men are sexually insatiable, men experience less harm than women do when raped by the opposite sex,  and women rarely or never rape.  Also included is the idea proposed by feminists that rape is a means to subordinate women.\n\nTheir conclusion:\n\n> While recognizing and lamenting the threat that sexual victimization continues to pose for women and girls, we aim to bring into the fold the vast cohort of male victims who have been overlooked in research, media, and governmental responses. In so doing, we first argue that it is time to move past the male perpetrator and female victim paradigm. Overreliance on it stigmatizes men who are victimized,8 risks portraying women as victims,52 and discourages discussion of abuse that runs counter to the paradigm, such as same-sex abuse and female perpetration of sexual victimization.\n\nThey also suggest that agencies change definitions and begin to include prison rape in statistics.","title":"The Sexual Victimization of Men in America: New Data Challenge Old Assumptions","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/f71eff\/the_sexual_victimization_of_men_in_america_new\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

The original claim has ambiguous parts to it.  The hearing failed at the most basic levels of due process, including not allowing the accused to have a copy of the complaint, denied the option to question witnesses*, and completed in five weeks from the complaint to the ruling.\n\nWhat is different in this case is:\n\n1. At the hearing for the motion to dismiss from the school, the judge felt that the evidence was so overwhelming against the school that he made a ruling on the motions from the bench instead of releasing a ruling later.\n\n2. The judge indicated \u201cI can\u2019t for the life of me find any other explanation\u201d other than gender bias for guilty finding. [from third party observer not court records].\n\nThis marks a potential change for these cases as proving gender discrimination in these hearings has been very hard to do unless you can show that women who have been accused are treated substantially differently.  Now the judge is stating that, in the sum of the evidence provided in the complaint, there is a reasonable conclusion to be made that the ruling was gender discrimination.\n\n[Additional Source](http:\/\/archive.fo\/H93dq#selection-907.713-907.1037) breaking down the complaint.\n\n*The accusation came only after the woman started living with her boyfriend.

You'll hear that women suffer abuse, violence, get raped, and so on. You never ever ever hear that men get raped more than women [[1](http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-2449454\/More-men-raped-US-women-including-prison-sexual-abuse.html)] [[2](https:\/\/www2.fbi.gov\/ucr\/cius2009\/data\/table_07.html)] [[3](http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/justice\/gender-equality\/files\/2007report_on_equal_pay_for_pub_-final_en.pdf)]. Statistics about men's issues are almost never mentioned. \n\nI don't know of any source that quantifies this data, but I think that beyond the experience of probably most of us, it lends a lot of support for this observation of mine that feminism is an absolutely enormous and powerful resource to spread gendered information but men have no reciprocal entity. [[1](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_women%27s_organizations) [[2](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?search=list+of+men%27s+organizations&title=Special%3ASearch&go=Go)]. While not fully verified, these observations are at least supported.\n\nAs an MRA, I'm always shocked at how unable to see sexism men so often can be. ~~Many men don't question why they have to spend $X.XXX on a wedding ring when the woman isn't expected to.~~ (EDIT: Wedding rings are probably a bad example). Many men don't question why it's okay to hit boys but not girls. Few are shocked or appalled at men's statistics. It almost just seems expected that men will see violence, end up in crime, pay alimony, etc. Society doesn't seem pissed (in my personal experience even happy) that women are 50% more likely than men to go to college. I always wonder why this is.       \n\nMy thought is of course that there's a strong causal link between the large and accepted narrative and men failing to see the sexism in their lives. How could the narrative thrust upon us since a young age not cloud our judgment here? If you're told since infancy that sexism won't really affect you then you won't be conditioned to see it affect you. \n\nContrarily, I see women reflect on sexism. Women seem to see sexism much more in their lives than I do. For instance, I'd never in a million years imagine that people sitting with their legs spread open is sexism. Likewise, I'd never see [cat calling as violence on the same spectrum as rape](http:\/\/www.ebony.com\/news-views\/street-harassment-catcalling-rape-culture-476#axzz3SjEN1VZf). I'd never think the culture endorses rape, especially after the DOJ found only 1\/166 women to have been raped in a survey much more respected than the CDC. I wouldn't generally think being underrepresented in a field means I'm discriminated against (in fact, I never hear about men getting discriminated against in nursing, women's studies, or biology.) A lot of this stuff just wouldn't register for me. \n\nHowever, for women the narrative is totally different. It's flipped. Women are told from a young age that there's  patriarchy, men are privileged and the world is male dominated, they hear about rape culture, violence against women (even as the name of a law), and about how the deck is stacked against them. Is it wrong to hear a causal link?\n\nI look at the quantifiable evidence of sexism and I'm just not seeing that most sexism is faced by women. However, the narrative is that it is. Is it unreasonable for me to suspect that a lot of the seeing sexism in women comes from a widespread societal narrative telling women that they're oppressed and a lot of men not seeing sexism comes from a widespread societal narrative telling men it's all hunky dory? As far as what I've seen, this is  a much better explanation for perceptions of sexism than are studies about quantifiable sexism faced by either, since it fits the perceptions much more clearly.

More parents will be stuck with children they never wanted, forced to raise a child alone or pay child support.

I claim that the threat to abortion is NOT old white men politicians. Gerrymandering is part of the problem, but also there are plenty of anti-abortion voters (half of them women) who would have their voices represented in any democracy. I think we need to change their hearts and minds, and perhaps genuinely including men's family planning interests in the conversation would help us feel more invested in reproductive rights. Abortions are overwhelmingly motivated by family planning (see literally any study on the topic, such as [this](https:\/\/bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1472-6874-13-29) and [this](https:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/pubs\/psrh\/full\/3711005.pdf)), not the physical effects of pregnancy, and family planning is in the best interests of men and women equally.","title":"Despressing News in USA","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/rbscll\/despressing_news_in_usa\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

It was really sad for me to hear how things are and what happened to her.  I did not really the entire Twitch chat, but it seems that the overwhelming majority of people (presumably many of them male) felt the same way.  The YouTube channel is not hers, but I think the surprisingly low number of dislikes shows that people do care about this issue if you approach it the right way.\n\nShe analyzes the situation as follows:\n\n* People who are serious about chess spend a lot of time among other chess players.\n* Most chess players are male.\n* Men do get horny, but the low number of women makes them desperate.\n* Some jerks decide to go for the youngest girls who seem most vulnerable, as they are the \"easiest prey\".\n* For those who do not engage in such behavior, it is really hard to understand the mindset that leads people there.\n\nNotice that this analysis does not involve the word \"patriarchy\".  I wonder if this is because she does not believe in it, or if she does not want to lose her male fans over this.  In my personal opinion, you do not need the \"patriarchy\" as an explanation, but it is yet again just a consequence of the asymmetry in sexual attention that men and women receive.  An adolescent boy in a group of thirsty women would probably have similar experiences.  This does not excuse anything, but I think it is important to put the blame on the individual, not the gender.\n\nAnyway, I still think something needs to be done in order to protect people (in this case, young women) better.

Messages were collected showed it was likely a setup and the boy and family are suing multiple entities involved. \n\nThis is being described on social media to be the \"Mean Girls\" lawsuit as it revolves around a influential group of girls bullying others and having a poor reputation with students but a good reputation with the school admin. Some of the parents of the girls involved are on the school board.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=do2CILfW8Jg (youtube video describing some of the situation)\n\nArticle: https:\/\/triblive.com\/local\/regional\/14142176-74\/lawsuit-accuses-seneca-valley-mean-girls-of-targeting-teen-boy-with-false\n\nAnother Youtube Video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kHPH3grlgSk&feature=youtu.be\n\nOne of the reasons why this case is so interesting is that the charges are still being levied against the boy and the charges were promised to be dropped by the school district but they have not done so. A case was made to the DA to pursue the girls and the DA declined to pursue criminal actions against the girls.  However the boy was pursued and was forced to be on probation and kicked off school teams before by the DA based on the initial allegations by the girls of the boy. The school did not punish the girls, yet the majority of the student body upon seeing leaked snapchat and other social media info that allegedly showed the girls setting the boy up and lying about it, are in support of the boy.\n\nSo you have a student body united in support of a boy against the 5 girls and against the school which did not pursue the incident and against the DA who choose not to investigate. This lack of doing anything in the face of evidence is what caused massive support for the incident.\n\nSome of the girl's parents are on the schoolboard. There is a large social media hashtag in support of the boy. Boy's family savings spent lots of money on a lawyer and facing against a lawyer representing girls (and the school) that is very expensive.\n\nDiscussion:\n\n1: Do school systems have a bias to believe a certain gender when there is a sexual allegation? In what direction?\n\n2: Is the DA refusing to procecute due to a discresionary reason a good thing for justice? Is gender a good reason? How about money or influence involved?\n\n3: How do we encourage a neutral position for schools? What kinds of policies should be put into place?\n\n4: What would be a just resolution to this case? If this is shown to be a false accusation setup by 5 girls to ruin a boys life, what should the resolution be? Should the girls be punished? School? Admins individually? DA? School board members?\n\n5: Read the comment section of the article linked above.

Why aren't they making fun of millionaire misogynists?\n\nWhy are people in this feminist age (when men are supposedly no longer required to be strong and tough) so fond of hating weak men and then pretending that they hate them because they are (supposedly) misogynist?\n\nThere is a disgust directed towards all weak men who desire any contact with women. Or simply towards all weak men, regardless of whether they desire contact with women. And this disgust is justified with accusations of misogyny.\n\nWhat is it? What's behind all this? What perverted subconscious processes lead to this 21st century disgust with niceguys, creeps, neckbeards, geeks, nicels, chuds, virgins, manchildren....?\n\nIs it because our reptilian brains are coming back and telling us that weak men don't deserve women (in this supposedly feminist age)? That they don't deserve anything?\n\nAnother issue is using these terms as simple slurs.

Race, Gender, and the Business Case for Diversity](http:\/\/www.uww.edu\/Documents\/diversity\/does%20diversity%20pay.pdf) claimed to show that gender and racial diversity results in better performing businesses, having more sales revenue, more profits, more customers, etc. In total, Herring had 8 measurements for company performance and found significant positive correlations to gender and racial diversity for 7 of these.\n\nThis study has been used to argue that diversity makes companies perform better.\n\nRecently, an attempt has been made to replicate this study, resulting in the paper [Does Diversity Pay? A Replication of Herring](https:\/\/db.tt\/MWK1yNUr62). The replication attempt was based on the same data, but it reran the statistical analysis. During the analysis, it was found that Herring had made two big errors.\n\nOne error was that the data had special codes for missing values, like 88888888888 when the value is unknown and 99999999999 when people had refused to answer. Herring used these as the actual value, so he treated these companies as if they had $88,888,888,888 and $99,999,999,999 in revenue.\n\nThe second error was that big companies are known to both be more diverse and have better performance. Herring had not corrected for this sufficiently.\n\nAfter fixing these two errors, only 1 of the 8 measurements correlated positively to gender (but not racial) diversity (more customers). The total number of tested hypotheses in the paper is 16 (8 measurements tested against 2 parameters, race and gender diversity, gives 8*2=16). Using p < 0.05 you'd expect one random significant outcome for every 20 tested hypotheses. 16\/20 = .8, so there is an 80% chance that the one significant outcome was random.\n\nThe replication paper concludes that after correcting the errors, there is no business case for diversity. Of course, one can still value diversity for other reasons.","title":"Study on diversity in the workplace fails to replicate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/6ns5s1\/study_on_diversity_in_the_workplace_fails_to\/","upvote_ratio":0.94,"over_18":false}

Recently some feminists tried to put blame on all males as being responsible for a toxic environment in which male rapists and sex offenders flourish. Obviously there is no such thing as this toxic environment in which all men stimulate or facilitate sex offences. Blaming all the men for this is discriminatory and should be penalized.\n\nI was thinking about this lately and I read an article of a dutch doctor ( Andre de Zutter ) who claimed that police believes to much false accusators and disbelieves to much real victims. Building further on this I thought about the fact that if we want to blame enablers of sex offenders, we should blame false accusers. After thinking this through I also thought the reverse is true. Female false accusers (of sex offenses) and male sex offenders are kind of living in symbiosis. Here is why:\n\n**Sex offenders need false accusers**, because the existence of false accusers helps rapists etc. to claim their victim (who is a real victim) is a false accuser. Moreover the fact that a lot of police officers, judges, psychologists encounter false accusation cases makes them more suspective towards real cases. The fact that difficult questions will be posed and that their experience will be questioned by professionals induces some victims to keep it secret. Moreover some real victims fear they will not be believed at all by the authorities. This will helps the sex offender, as these victims will not file a complaint. Additionally the resources spent on false accusations help real sex offenders as these resources could not be spend on real rape cases.\n\nMoreover people who first-hand wittnesed a false accusation will be very suspicious towards real victims and may not provide the support these victims need and deserve.\n\n**False accusers on the other hand also need sex offenders.** They need the prevalence of this crime in order to damage their victim. They try to hide in between the real rape and sexual offense cases. The more real cases there are, the easier it gets for them to hide. People who have wittnesed a rape case may somehow be very biased and suffering from a tunnelvision, willing to punish a victim of a false accusation.\n\nAs you can see both kind of criminals make use of the prevalence of eachothers crime and the fact that is very difficult to clearly determine who is lying.\n\nIn my opinion we should convince feminists to tackle the issue of female false accusations and the damaging impact of this on sexual offense victims. Instead of blaming innocent men for creating a non-existing toxic athmosphere, feminists should start to blame cruel women who spread untrue rumours about men and in this way enabling real sex offenders to get away with their crimes. I think this goes further than sex offenses alone, as other issues with similar dynamics like  child abuse or domestic abuse, may as well benefit from a harder stance on false accusations.\n\n**What is your opinion about this statement: Sex offenders facilitate false accusers and vise versa.**\n\nNote: I do know that there are a lot of male victims of sexual offenses. However false accusations are less an issue in these cases. In fact, there are not enough male victims stepping forward.\n\nNote 2: Numbers about false accusations: 11% of the US men and 6% of the US women have been falsly accused of  domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, or other forms of abuse. This include all false accusations and allegations, not only those filed to the police ([http:\/\/www.prosecutorintegrity.org\/pr\/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse\/](http:\/\/www.prosecutorintegrity.org\/pr\/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse\/)). The main perpretator of the false accusations were women (for both male and female victims). It is estimated that in between 5-10% of the rape accusations filed by women at the police are false. However it is also expected that only 10% of the rapes on women are reported. Both of these numbers indicate a huge amount of suffering and injustice.","title":"The symbiosis of false accusers and sex offenders","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/mndpt5\/the_symbiosis_of_false_accusers_and_sex_offenders\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

A left-winger is an egalitarian who advocates reducing inequality through social change. This community aims to fill a void in the political landscape, by incorporating male issues into left-wing thought.  \n>  \n>We believe men are not being well-served by either side of the mainstream political spectrum. We oppose right-wing exploitation of men's issues as a wedge to recruit men to inegalitarian traditional values. But we also oppose feminist attempts to deny male issues, or shoehorn them into a biased ideology that blames \"male privilege\" and  guilt-trips men.  \n>  \n>We have no objection to the genuinely egalitarian aspects of feminism, but we will criticize feminist ideology wherever it is inegalitarian and\/or untruthful. Even a historically liberating ideology should not be considered above criticism, now that it holds institutional power. Too often feminism has promoted a one-sided  \u201cequality\u201d, dismantling male advantages while exploiting, reinforcing, preserving, and downplaying female advantages - particularly in cases involving alleged abuse.\n\nAnd the much longer full version of the Mission Statement can be read here:  [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/wiki\/missionstatement](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/wiki\/missionstatement)\n\n(EDIT: And just to make sure I'm not violating Rule 2, let me clarify that I'm not describing ALL right-wingers or ALL feminists, just criticizing general trends that I see in those groups.)\n\nI know from past discussions that there are some people here who might be interested.

However, I also have certain problems with feminism and I would like to expand on them. \n\nI think feminists , while they're theoretically against benevolent sexism, in practice they often take advantage of it. Benevolent sexism is of course the idea that women are more virtuous and less dangerous than men and that they should be given special treatment and that men and society should basically take care of women and protect them.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lSomgylk9X8\n\nWatch this video for example. They're arguing that women should be given less harsh sentences for petty crime and drug offenses. Okay, fine. However, why are they not pushing for the same thing for men? The excuse is that women should be treated less harshly because they're the \"primary care-givers\"? Well, isn't that exactly a sexist stereotype? Maybe men would be the primary care-givers too if they could stay with their families instead of going to prison. \n\nAnother example is how military service is treated here in Greece. Men are obligated by law to serve the army for at least 9 months. (basically legal slavery) Women are not obligated. Feminists are theoretically against military service all together, but there are *barely* any campaigns to abolish it. How isn't it sexist to assume that women are not suited for the army? In my opinion, feminists should either push for making military service mandatory for women too or at least try to abolish military service. In my experience, Greek feminists will just give a nod at the idea that military service should be abolished , but \u0399 don't see any serious feminist campaigns for it. \n\nAnother thing is that I believe feminists demonize the behavior of the working-class male. Things like cat-calling, using inappropriate language etc. seem to be stereotypical behaviors of the lower classes rather than the manners of the upper class. I am *not* saying that cat-calling should be tolerated. I just wonder if criminalizing such behaviors will only make things harder for men of the lower classes. I think they already criminalized cat-calling and \"aggressive flirting\" in France. However, think about it for a second. Who will these laws mostly target? Will they target men of the upper and middle classes? Or will they be used mostly against uneducated males of the lower classes? Again, I am not saying that cat-calling should be tolerated, I just don't know if criminalizing it is the right approach.

So based on this study, they are strongly motivated to be benevolent sexists.  Yet benevolent sexism perpetuates gender inequality.\n\n* Should we focus on getting women (feminists in particular) to change their mate preferences?\n* Should we focus on getting men to be non-sexist (even though we know that means that many will therefore end up alone)?\n* Should we just abandon the goal of gender equality?","title":"Another study showing women prefer benevolently sexist men as relationship partners","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/8xpv5p\/another_study_showing_women_prefer_benevolently\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

This includes every single man that has said something openly in public (not on some obscure sub). There is near universal disgust at the comments. Many people within his own party are even calling him to step down over the comments.\n\nIn a rape culture, he would be celebrated and people would repeat the comments openly. Therefore, we are not in a rape culture.\n\n2) Trump doesn't talk about just ANYONE'S ability to go around grabbing vaginas, but rather HIS ability to do it because he is famous. \n\nWe do have a 'star culture' in this country, which is in stark contrast to rape culture, in that star culture pervades our media, our attention, our conversations, and we actually worship stars and give them special privileges.\n\nTrump could kiss girls and grab their vaginas because he's famous, not because he's a man. Just the same way that OJ Simpson can slash two throats and walk free because he is a wealthy athlete.\n\nBut where this article really loses ALL CREDIBILITY is in this line: \n\n>Rape culture is what allows famous men like Bill Cosby to remain untarnished in the public eye until more than 50 women publicly accused him of sexual assault. \n\nUntarnished? Does the author read anything or have a TV?\n\nInstead of using terms like 'rape culture' which have no coherent meaning, how about focusing on the issue at hand. In this case, Trump's wealth and star power give him a pass to do horrible things to women. It's the same problem that lets stars get away with a list of other crimes.","title":"Wrong, HuffPo, Trump's comments aren't rape culture in a nutshell as they are universally reviled, they are actually evidence of the problems with celebrity worship","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/56h9vb\/wrong_huffpo_trumps_comments_arent_rape_culture\/","upvote_ratio":0.81,"over_18":false}

He gives a reasoned explanation for why his problem with the movie is not that it looks bad - and the trailer is absolutely awful - but that it's a shameless reboot using the title of simply \"Ghostbusters\" to try to trade on the reputation of the original classic without giving any respect to that classic, or to Ghostbusters lore. The only time he even mentions that it's an all-female cast is as a factual statement, pretty much an aside, and casts no value judgement on this casting choice at all. \n\nQuite a reasonable video, no? Even if you disagree with him, he clearly lays out where he's coming from, and in the end he is exercising his rights as a consumer not to support a work he has a problem with. But the way 'feminist Twitter' - for want of a better term, has been [acting](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LbUEcl8.jpg), you'd think he'd just called for the simultaneous repeal of Roe vs Wade and the EPA. And then of course this has triggered yet another wave of clickbait \"articles\" from all the usual bloggers and so-called 'journalists' all about how it's impossible to hate the Ghostbusters trailer without being a misogynistic troglodyte. \n\nI think the one that pissed me off the most has to be [this one](https:\/\/archive.is\/s4UuX#selection-829.0-1213.124) (archived because I refuse to support clickbait BS), where Devin Faraci - who, by the way, is [this guy](https:\/\/s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com\/736x\/a7\/d2\/4c\/a7d24cc96b8ca75a2a253edb88e426a6.jpg) (NSFW) - acknowledges that nothing Rolfe said was the least bit sexist, admits that the trailers and everything we've seen out of the movie looks like a hunk of garbage, and yet still concludes that Rolfe's video must be motivated by subconscious sexism because reasons. Oh, Devin's allowed to hate the movie, but how dare others have the same opinion? They must hate women. \n\nThis has gotten absolutely ridiculous. Since when was it impossible to hate a movie without being declared a filthy misogynist man-baby neckbeard MRA loser? And why do these clickbait bloggers and armchair activists have to turn everything in geek culture into a gender war battleground? It's like when the new Mad Max came out. Men loved it because it was a high-octane action-packed thrillride. Women loved it because it had a strong female protagonist. Feminists loved it because it explored feminist themes. So everybody's happy, right? No, instead the bloggers and activists had to focus on the three people who refused to see it because it had a strong focus on Furiosa, and stir up a big nontroversy about a boycott that never existed.\n\nIf anyone wants my opinion on the new Ghostbusters, the original is quite possibly my favourite movie of all time, it (and the sequel and the cartoon series and the toys) was a huge part of my childhood, and judging by the trailers this new movie is an absolute travesty that shits all over that legacy. And I'd feel exactly the same way no matter what the main cast had between their legs. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let faux feminists and activist bloggers shame me into not voicing that opinion.","title":"[Rant] Since when was it impossible to hate a movie without being declared a filthy misogynist?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4k10a3\/rant_since_when_was_it_impossible_to_hate_a_movie\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

When I take a look at feminist media, these words are pretty commonly used, and those who refuse to do so are usually shunned as \"not real feminists\".\n\nSo what do you think?  Are the words \"patriarchy\" and \"toxic masculinity\" and the theory behind them essential to feminism, or does it only appear to me like that because I spend too much time online?","title":"Do you consider the concepts of \"patriarchy\" and \"toxic masculinity\" as essential to feminism?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/h7mhiy\/do_you_consider_the_concepts_of_patriarchy_and\/","upvote_ratio":0.95,"over_18":false}

One of the models was a handsome, fit man.  The mentor of the show kept making remarks about his chest and whether it could fit into the shirt he was going to wear.  The camera and the other participants were drooling over the guy's abs.  Then, when it came time for judging, it continued on the stage.  For instance, the model was wearing pants that showed his ankles and one of the judges remarked that's what he called 'man cleavage'.  So, the model couldn't even stand on stage in clothes designed to show his ankles without people making uncomfortable remarks.\n\nI thought the behavior was so outrageous, that I googled to see if any outlets were talking about it.  There weren't any I could find.  But, I did find this piece.\n\nThe letter the model in this article wrote is very poignant.  It really gave me a feeling of how sexual harassment and abuse happen in the industry.  How scared and naive the victims are.  He's the one that started the mentoo hashtag.  \n\n\n\nProject Runway used to be associated with Harvey Weinstein.  How the producers looked through hours of tape and thought it would be a hoot to show a male model getting harassed I don't know.  It is just so normalized still.

Even by posting this I feel vulnerable to being branded a misogynist.\n\n# [Education](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/education\/archive\/2014\/09\/why-girls-get-better-grades-than-boys-do\/380318\/)\n\n[Teachers give higher marks to girls](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/education-31751672)\n\n[Boys get penalized a lot more than girls for the same behavioral problems](https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/articles\/2016-06-22\/boys-bear-the-brunt-of-school-discipline)\n\nWomen fare better than men in **all** levels of education. This not only seems to be the case in virtually all western nations, but on a majority of nations worldwide. This is statistical fact, and not something to be debated. Yet we \"need more women in STEM\".\n\n# [Health](https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/newsletter_article\/mars-vs-venus-the-gender-gap-in-health)\n\nWomen have it much better when talking about overall health, (ecompasing biology and violence for example). Off hand, it's far more dangerous to be a man, as you're more likely to be a victim of violence, but you're also more likely to be homeless, more likely to be a danger to yourself, more likely to die on the job, will retire later than women despite living less than them, more likely to die in wars, etc. Worst of all, all of these problems will be dealth with poorly, or worst case scenario, completely ignored or even denied (like [being almost half the victims of domestic violence](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2010\/sep\/05\/men-victims-domestic-violence)).\n\nPersonally I find health to be the **worst example of gender disparity** in society, given how many areas it includes, and how many double standards, neglect or overal hypocrisy can be found on these subjects.\n\n# Government and social resources, and (consumer) spending [\\[1\\]](https:\/\/www.libraryindex.com\/pages\/901\/Who-Receives-Benefits-AN-OVERVIEW-WELFARE-PROGRAM-PARTICIPATION.html) [\\[2\\]](http:\/\/www.genderleadershipgroup.com\/the-inclusionary-leadership-blog\/210)\n\nPretty self explanatory I feel.

The old \"reversing the genders\" is one of the ways to easily reinforce this. Domestic violence and pedophilia just to name two big examples of this. Male disposability in general. We can expand on this subject a lot if needed.\n\n# Rights\n\nNot much to say here, in places were abortion exists, women quite literally have more rights than men. Not only that, but they have methods and resources to help them renounce motherhood at every stage of it (Safe Haven laws). Men usually have \"man up\", or jail (no way to sever link of fatherhood, forced to provide child support, no matter the context, like reproductive coercion, being proven as not being the father, or [**even if they have been raped**](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2014\/09\/02\/statutory-rape-victim-child-support\/14953965\/)).\n\nWomen can vote without signing up for the Selective Service.\n\nThey have the right to genital (bodily) integrity (FGM is illegal, MGM is not).\n\nOn the other hand, a common feminist point is to fight for women's rights they either don't have or are afraid of losing, while mantaining that men already have \"all\" their rights.\n\nIt's apparent that while men have it worse in just about every major metric in our society, we still get told it's the other way and usually shamed badly for even daring to question the narrative.

The argument is basically \"it's different because patriarchy\": a supposed \"power imbalance\" makes it okay or impossible for women to objectify men \n\nThe problem with this argument is threefold:\n\nFirstly, the claim that women having less power makes it impossible or okay for them to treat men as objects is erroneous. It's like saying less power makes it impossible for women to be sexist against men, or less physical strength makes it impossible for a woman to abuse a man\n\nAnyone who perceives another person as an object to be used as a tool is by definition objectifying this other person; supposed power imbalances have nothing to do with it. If objectifying people is a bad thing, accepting it from women but not from men doesn't address the problem of objectification. It only discourages objectification of women while encouraging objectification of men\n\nSecondly, the claim that men can't be objectified because they're already inherently perceived as human beings, while women are not, and therefore can't be reduced to mere objects even when they are sexualized is wrong. Men are often perceived as tools rather than human beings with inherent worth\n\nOne can see this in how they're the ones with the social duty to risk their lives to protect women; how men are expected and sometimes forced to go into war or do dangerous, life-threatening jobs in order to keep the women safe and taken care of. In this climate, it is not abnormal for people to objectify men as cannon fodder: tools that's purpose is to protect women; or ATM's: tools that's purpose is to provide for women\n\nThere are men who see women as sex objects, just like there are women who see men as free meals or free gifts and who only value them for how useful of a tool he is for her and how much he can do for her\n\nThirdly, the claim that men have more power and therefore are not affected or negatively impacted by sexual objectification is false. Men don't have more power than women in every area, especially not in the area of sexual mistreatment--objectification, harassment, or assault. A man can be sexually victimized by a woman the same way a woman can be victimized by a man. Some women can and do treat men as sex objects, sexually harass men, touch men without their consent, coerce men into sex, etc.. The difference, socially, is that female-on-male sexual mistreatment typically gets even less consideration\n\nSociety doesn't perceive it as a serious crime the way it does male-on-female sexual mistreatment; male victims are told by society that because we're male we should be grateful for the female attention; men who do speak up about it or the discomfort it causes them are silenced or shamed for complaining about it; and, of course, we're told it's not important because we're supposedly privileged and empowered and therefore can't truly be victimized in this way\n\nConsidering this kind of social environment that routinely marginalizes female-on-male sexual mistreatment does not indicate males having more power than females. When it comes to how society treats victims of sexual objectification, harassment, etc., that's one area where it seems males have even less power than females","title":"The issue with \"men can't be objectified\" or \"it's not harmful for women to objectify men\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/8gr7dj\/the_issue_with_men_cant_be_objectified_or_its_not\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

What do you have against us? \u201cWe are fighting to end hate, to unite as one and love each other. We are fighting to be treated right without discrimination and for everyone to have equal opportunities.\u201d**\n\nto which the reply was.\n\n>Bullshit. You have no quantifiable metrics for injustice, so you have no victory conditions (for a very simplified example, when blacks hold X% of all engineering jobs and are only Y% of all prisoners, racism is ended). That would be fine by itself, but you believe in fighting injustice with injustice (gays have historically been denied gay marriage? let\u2019s get random CEOs fired for opinions they held six years ago). You don\u2019t seek converts, you seek to punish and bully \u2013 straight white males who disagree with you must be purged and publicly humiliated. Even the jihadists will spare you if you convert; no apology or future correction will satisfy a SJW.\n\n>I could forgive that too if you weren\u2019t all hypocrites and liars. Your treatment of women and minority dissenters is appalling; if they don\u2019t want you acting on their behalf, that\u2019s their choice, not \u201cinternalized patriarchy\u201d or whatever. You rob them of moral agency. When called out for these behaviors (as you always insist on calling out others), you lie. You strawman your opponents (criticized a woman? misogynist!), you group them with the worst (you\u2019re a gamer? you\u2019re as bad as the anonymous rape threateners!) and when confronted with your own flaws, you restate them less threateningly (motte and bailey argument). You phrase all arguments as kafkatraps (disagreeing with your assertion that we are evil is taken as proof that we\u2019re evil). You publish manipulated and misleading statistics, then lambast anyone who questions them.\n\n>You insist on vigilante justice against random acts of the week for your two-minutes hate. Why is it the NFL\u2019s business to punish domestic violence? And, if it is their business, why isn\u2019t Hope Solo receiving the same attention from your side?\n\n>Then you claim to be arguing for equality, but you\u2019ve taken the idea of racism (hatred based on skin color is bad) and replaced it with a new concept where only one race can be guilty of racism. You excuse racial prejudice and hatred based on what I\u2019ve already explained are arbitrary, unmeasured states of being. Your solution for the unequal treatment of whites and blacks is to hold whites to a higher standard. Your side lobbied the FBI to redefine rape so more women victims would be counted, but also so that \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d does not count, leaving male victims in the cold. Because male privilege, apparently.\n\n>Historically ignorant SJWs think whites hold collective guilt for the awful things our ancestors have done. But they don\u2019t care about the unspeakable atrocities by other races. The only difference between whites and others was that whites had the social and technological prowess to do evil efficiently; Africans, Asians, Indians, and everyone else practiced genocide and slavery, they were just less adept at doing it right. Given the means, they would have done the same. But nope, only whites are guilty; Arab oppression of blacks and caucasians never happened, not to us, nope.\n\n>I\u2019ve been lucky enough to grow up in America, so this shit is new to me. But I\u2019m descended from puritans, and I know my history; I know how they treated dissent. I also know how commies treated dissent; I grew up next door to a grizzled old Russian who barely avoided the gulag by smuggling himself out of the country. I know what you petty tyrants have turned into every time you gained enough power.\n\n>Worst of all, you turn the very principles of freedom against us. We tolerate you because we believe in free speech and civil discourse, not bullying and violence. But that means we have to watch you advocate against that very freedom. We don\u2019t believe in ruining a stranger\u2019s professional life over an opinion, but that means that we can\u2019t punish your actions.\n\n>We believe that the rightness of our actions should speak for itself. You believe in bullying, even as you claim to love the oppressed.\n\n>Funny how the evil and all-powerful patriarchy has seen fit to act according to SJW whims for all of recent memory, punishing those they hate and protecting those they love. Funny how the evil oppressor males have to speak anonymously, while the SJWs fighting the power can use their real names and get mainstream media coverage for fun and profit. How when a million straight white male nerds get bullied, no one cares, but the minute one gay guy hangs himself, suddenly bullying matters \u2013 and the solution, of course, is more bullying, but by the \u201cright\u201d people.\n\n>That\u2019s the arrogant core of it. You do the same evil, in the same pattern, as so many before you, because mob justice, punishing dissent, and repression of others is just fine and dandy so long as the \u201cright\u201d people are doing it to the \u201cwrong\u201d people.\n\n>Eat shit and die.

Because one spokeswoman says \n>each case will be considered separately, regardless of whether the organization's membership is male or female. \"Harvard College will look at the individual circumstances of each currently unrecognized single-gender social organization, irrespective of gender, and provide assistance to organizations who request assistance to help them make the transition to a more inclusive organization,\" Dane said.\n\nwhich seems to contradict what the deans have said\n>Khurana said he will look to recommendations from one of the two committees in particular.

Currently, because they do not take into account context and instead have neutral guidelines, their automated and human reviewed bannings end up punishing women who use gendered comments about men. Author notes that white men are considered a \"protected group\" by the facebook platform and commentates based on that. \"The system is far from perfect\"; Context matters and automated services should recognize that. The author defends some speech against men, calling it \"Ironic misandry\" as a method to deal with \"frequent abuse at the hands of powerful men\". As a last point, the author talks about the chilling effect on social media where each comment feels like stepping into a minefield, not knowing if it is ok or it will result in a ban.\n\n\nMy analysis: There are lots of platforms that have unclear rules, and while I am sure that Facebook's rules have their own problems, it looks like the examples brought up here seem to be equal enforcement of threats or hate speech rules. If the platform is going to ban slurs or disparaging comments about women, it seems fair to ban them when they concern men as well. The author is arguing for an unequal enforcement of rules or to exclude white men from a protected group.\n\n\n\"Ironic Misandry\" seems to be going for that \"its just a prank bro\" excuse. Either it is or it is not a violation. Asking for context just adds bias to the system. Systems that take into account factors such as race or gender will end up biased. \n\nAs for the minefield that it can create, absolutely. Try stepping into a default sub as a conservative. Or try being that in certain circles online. I know many conservative people who work in these fields and they complain that they can't showcase their views without retaliation...not even just at work, but anywhere on social media.\n\nSince the article mentions both viral movements, #MeToo and #Pizzagate are both calling individuals out about possible crimes they could be linked to. Now if you believe one and not the other or you are skeptical about both, fine. However, the author wants one banned from the platform completely and the other is an important method of publicity.

Because that's how it sounds to me to say \"yeah, they cause harm to their victims, but think about how hard they have it; all the restrictions placed on them\" \n\nI'll admit a slight personal prejudice, as the women who abused me were never brought to any kind of legal justice--and that even now that seems to be a common theme, judging by the cases I read and the other former-victims who I know--I'm hostile to anything resembling giving female sexual predators even less punishment than they already get. But I analyzed this as level-headedly as I could\n\nBut still, especially for the grown woman who knowingly abused her 16-year-old student, the therapist who abused her 17-year-old client, and the woman who raped an 11-year-old boy, any negative consequences are practically self-inflicted. They committed horrible acts of sexual abuse, and this whole thing sounds to me like they're complaining that people treat them differently because of it\n>She finds men are either repulsed by it or begin to fetishize her.\n\nIt's a repulsive act; why is it wrong when people are repulsed by it? They don't have to be okay with it\n\nOn the other hand, the stalking and actual physical harassment is a valid concern. But even then, it doesn't justify the gendered approach\n>Logue said he has never known any male sex offender to attract the type of attention described by the six female registrants I interviewed for this piece...\"The 10 Hottest Women on the Texas Sex Offenders List\"\n\nThis is the difference between male and female offenders. Male offenders get 'attention' like \"he deserves to be castrated and hung!\"; female offenders get 'attention' like \"she's hot; what a lucky boy!\"\n\nIn other words, both male and female sex offenders on the registry may face harassment. Women's may be more sexual in nature, but that doesn't change that men face violent assault, violent threats, and joblessness \/ homelessness at least as much\n\nTl;dr I don't believe a person being perceived differently (e.g. now people think he \/ she's repulsive or a \"sex freak\") because he \/ she is convicted of sexual assault is unfair in the least. A person being physically attacked or harassed is unfair, but that applies to both male and female offenders. So overall, this whole article still seems like a bunch of BS no matter how many times I read it. But what do you all think?","title":"So being labeled a sex offender is unfair punishment for female sex offenders?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/78m6cs\/so_being_labeled_a_sex_offender_is_unfair\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

There will be a lot of links, a lot of sourced statistics, and some of my hypotheses surrounding them.  It is meant to get a critical eye on my assumptions and hypotheses.\n\nThe subject is female on male rape.  This is a type of rape that doesn't get a lot of attention in the media or in activism.  That's for multiple reasons, which I will go into below.\n\nThere was some statistical data coming out in the late 80s and early 90s that female on male rape wasn't as rare as assumed, and that women are perhaps nearly as shitty as men in this regard.  This might have led to a bit of a knowledge revolution in the field and a refocus of activism if it weren't for the effort of one group.\n\nFeminist academics.  The spearheading of this effort was led by Mary Koss in 1993 with her paper \"detecting the scope of rape\".\n\nhttp:\/\/www.avoiceformalestudents.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf\n\nLink for you all.  In this paper, she clarified for researchers (down to this day) that rape should never include a man being forced to penetrate a woman.  This has been used in multiple follow up studies, including the widely cited CDC studies from 2010, 2011, and 2012.  Links here:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/pdf\/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/ss6308a1.htm?s_cid=ss6308a1_e\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/pdf\/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\nI will be referencing those later.  Suffice to say, the media doesn't turn a critical eye on these things (generally) and points out that women are basically all the rape victims and men are pretty much all the perpetrators.  What they neglect is that the definition itself is sexist, and that's why you get that result.\n\nNow enter the MRAs.  MRAs should be pushing for this gender neutral definition of rape that includes male victims, yes?  Well, they're not opposed to it (generally, in my experience), but the main activism point seems to be false rape accusations instead.  I'm not saying that's an invalid line of inquiry (as several recent cases have showed), but in my view, it would be far more important to start getting these female rapists prosecuted for their crimes, and to do that, we need awareness, and to get awareness, we need to push back against sexist definitions in the statistics pushed by feminists.\n\nAnd without that awareness, things get even worse.\n\nIn the aforementioned CDC studies, you'll notice something odd.  In the 1 year data (for 2 years straight) men reported being made to penetrate about as often as women reported being raped (including attempts).  In the third year, more men reported being made to penetrate than women reported being raped (I consider that a questionable result personally as it doesn't match previous trend data, but we'll see what the next year brings).\n\nHowever, in the lifetime numbers, you find much much less men made to penetrate.  In fact, the numbers are so disparate, if you add up the 3 years, you'll find over 60% of men made to penetrate in their lifetime were made to do so in the last three years of the survey.  This is a strange (borderline unbelievable) result.\n\nSo why the disparity on lifetime numbers?  I think another paper linked here on FeMRADebates finally gives me the insight:\n\nhttp:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/84762\/1\/Revised_IJLC_Towards_a_case_for_recognising_forced_to_penetrate_cases_as_rape.pdf\n\n>As such, in their experiences some of the men explicitly documented that they did not report their experience to the police or indeed to anyone else for fear of stigmatisation and disbelief: \n\n>It\u2019s one thing to deal with the aftereffect of being raped, but it also was a secondary hit for me \u2014 oh, you\u2019re a guy, how could you be raped by a woman, that makes no sense \u2026 I was afraid to talk to anybody about it because of the stigma I felt I would receive in talking about it (Anderson et al., N.D).\n\nNo surprise but had to be sourced.  Society mocks men for getting raped.  So how do men respond?\n\n>Finally, one compelled penetration victim noted how he did not truthfully disclose what had happened, instead framing his experience to others as one that involved consensual sex in order to maintain his masculinity:\n\n>At that point, I decided to own it. Because if I owned it, it wasn't embarrassing and it didn't strip me of my masculinity. I had never heard of this happening to anybody else, and researching it online made my problem seem more real to me, which was frightening. Panic flooded me and all I wanted to do was scrub my soul of everything that was demoralising and demasculinising about the experience. My interpretation became consensual sex, and I proclaimed that sex was awesome, even though I had no clue what it felt like at all. I bragged to my neighbors, who could hear her wailing through paper-thin walls. The more I bragged, the more the agony subsided (xojane.com, 2013)\n\nWow.  He re-imagined his rape as consensual sex to try and make the problem go away.  And this is not actually ineffective, incidentally.   It turns out, we don't actually remember an event we remembered before.  We remember the last time we remembered it - so frequently remembered events drift further and faster than those remembered infrequently.\n\nhttps:\/\/news.northwestern.edu\/stories\/2012\/09\/your-memory-is-like-the-telephone-game\n\nMy hypothesis:  These men are mentally erasing their own victimization just because society mocks them.  Men are probably raped about as much as women over their lifetime, but society shames them into literally changing their memories to fit the social narrative pushed by traditional conservatives and feminists both, and the MRAs, as a group, are doing little to address it besides lip service.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nFeMRADebates, you analyze.\n\n\nEDIT: Well, this post got me banned from \/r\/AskFeminists and a \"fuck off\" from the moderator.  I really wanted their opinion.

But it *was* a little refreshing to see Michael Moore and Louis CK corrected.  Although- I think that maybe 2 examples may be a little shy of the requisite amount to start making generalizations about \"liberal men\", or that it is \"rising\".\n\nAnd it brought about an issue of framing.  I'm pretty sure that if the genders had been flipped, the women would have been accused of \"internalized misogyny\".  But there are a number of cultural biases which make the decision to frame this as \"benevolent sexism\" rather than \"internalized misandry\".  It's no surprise with Louis CK- the poor guy has a sketch about [how uncomfortable he is with his sexuality](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FzkeHzrTUm8).  Certainly his analysis of the unimportance of fathers kind of breaks my heart given that his sitcom focuses so much on him as a single father.  I really don't have any anger and resentment to offer louis, I just feel very sad for him.  A lot of his [other](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b4hNaFkbZYU) [comedy](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZZRqM1QICbo) [depicts scenes](http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2015\/05\/did-louie-get-raped.html) which make me feel like he's just constantly on the verge of (to steal a silly SJW phrase) \"becoming woke\" but he just can't take that step.  Louis just strikes me as this guy whose inner voice is yelling at him as loud as it can, but he just can't find it in himself to defect from social custom.\n\nBut there also seems to be a certain amount of \"it's only wrong when liberal men do it\" at play here.  It's anecdotal, but I have vivid memories of an ex-girlfriend marshalling the exact same argument one morning in one of those playful conversations that gets serious out of the blue.  Neither of us could believe how sexist the other was being- me for thinking that women had the same potential for hawkishness that men did.   The Huffington post [claims that women are more moral than men](http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/06\/19\/men-less-moral-women-ethical-standards_n_1609426.html).  So does [the telegraph](http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/science\/science-news\/9206176\/Women-are-more-moral-than-men-survey-says.html).  We know that internalized misogyny is the common term for women who are sexist against women, but what do we call it when women show benevolent sexism towards women?\n\nI don't think this bias is just a liberal man thing.  I think it underpins the traditionalism found in conservatives, and that it is found in men and women alike.  In some cases, it is tolerated or encouraged because it is seen as a positive bias which would hopefully counter a pre-existing bias *against* women.  For instance google searches for [women make better leaders](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=women+make+better+leaders&oq=women+make+better+leaders&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i61j0j69i60j69i61.4327j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and [men make better leaders](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=women+make+better+leaders&oq=women+make+better+leaders&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i61j0j69i60j69i61.4327j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=men+make+better+leaders) both agree that women make better leaders, and I suspect that most of those articles are actually written hoping to balance the scales rather than actually push women ahead of men.  \n\n[There was a debate.org thing over this subject](http:\/\/www.debate.org\/opinions\/are-women-more-moral-than-men) which showed that the split over whether people thought that women were more moral than men won by a slight (54%) majority.  But it's a little sobering to realize that the minority position was the *neutral* position, not the *opposite* position.  The only options are a) women are more moral than men, and b) men and women are equally moral.  It's a fringe view to consider the opposite- that men might be more moral than women- and that's pretty telling.\n\nAnd then- to get all [nietzchean](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/On_the_Genealogy_of_Morality) for a moment- what are morals?  Morality is often seen as being culturally dependent and something which is not fixed, but rather is fluid in response to the times.  Nietzche saw morality (at least in terms of good\/bad) as the rationalization which justified the exercise of power by the strong against the weak.  If women *are* in fact \"more moral\"- what does imply that we have constructed a moral code which favors women?  Then again, as the vox article points out- that perception of moral superiority is a hazard for women seeking equality.  \n\nthoughts?","title":"Louis CK, Michael Moore, Hillary Clinton, and the rise of benevolent sexism in liberal men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/5b4opz\/louis_ck_michael_moore_hillary_clinton_and_the\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

It's late in the evening, around midnight or slightly later, and I'm keeping an eye on the donation-honor bar.  As I do so, I'm hanging out with a friend of mine, a woman who is pretty center-mass mainstream feminist by inclination. There's these two guys who showed up some time earlier that nobody seemed to know really well.  Both guys are drunk, the one guy is stumbling drunk.  So I cut him off.  I was cordial and friendly and non-confrontational about it.  These two are far from the first drunks I have dealt with in a public space.  \n\nThe guy I cut off is fine, or maybe just too incoherent to mount a protest.  His friend, however, decides he's going work the issue.  He starts off friendly, \"having a good night?  Were you born here? (a common question in Seattle).  No?  Midwest, right?  Yeah, I could tell.\"  Then he flips the switch into belligerent drunk mode.  \"Well, I think you should give us another couple drinks.  Don't be a god damn faggot.  [to my friend] Look at this guy.  Hope you're not with this guy, fucking Wisconsinite, probably gets of sucking cows.\"  And so on and so forth.\n\nThe nerve of the guy....thinking I'm from Wisconsin!\n\nAnyway...point of the story is after they went away, my friend commented \"that's the first time I've ever seen a man harassed.\"  My response was \"wut?\"  \"Yeah,\" she says, \"that's what it's like.  They're friendly one minute, but you don't say the thing they want to hear or whatever, so they just switch and get violently confrontational.\"\n\nThis made me literally pause.  Had she not been standing there witnessing and later commenting, I would never, ever have thought to use the word \"harassment\" to describe the situation.  To my way of thinking, this was merely 'interaction with belligerent drunk; episode 12,749.'\n\nI'm not really saying she's right and I'm wrong.  Nor am I saying the opposite.  It did make me think, though, that whatever frustrations we feel about the dynamics of gender politics are probably exacerbated by not having a shared vocabulary.","title":"A thing that happened this past weekend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/54lhts\/a_thing_that_happened_this_past_weekend\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

The underrepresentation of men in college began in the 1990s and has frequently been discussed in national policy debates. To date, there is no comprehensive explanation as to why the underrepresentation of men is more severe in some countries than in others. Using data from 18 nations, we show that the underrepresentation of men is related both to secular changes in attitudes toward women\u2019s education and to boys\u2019 disadvantages in reading comprehension. Increasing men\u2019s engagement in postsecondary education will require significant improvement in boys\u2019 reading competencies.\n\nIf I'm understanding this paper, they say that women's reading ability is tied to their school performance.  And when it became acceptable for women to attend college, that skill enabled them to outperform men.  \n\nThis is the simplest explanation I've ever heard for the differences in college attendance.  \n\nThere's two ideas they present. One, to help boys with reading, of course.  The other is to:\n\n> Visuospatial and mechanical reasoning abilities are important for achievement in the physical sciences and engineering, as well as in many vocations that require some tertiary education, but not necessarily a university degree (19\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u201325). Individuals who excel in these areas (i.e., they are relatively better at spatial\/mechanical reasoning than mathematics or reading) are more likely to be disengaged from school, less likely to attend tertiary education, and often less accomplished professionally, even if their overall mathematics and reading competencies are above average (19, 25). There are more boys than girls with this profile, and curricula changes that provide opportunities to capitalize on their strengths and corresponding interests might improve their overall engagement in primary and secondary schooling, as well as increase their numbers in tertiary education (26, 27). This is not to say that reading competencies are not critical: they are. Rather, improvements in overall reading competencies might not need to be as substantive as our models suggest to increase men\u2019s engagement in tertiary education if there were more opportunities for boys and men to capitalize on their spatial and mechanical strengths in educational settings.\n\nThey don't think the numbers are going to change any time soon though.\n\n> The practical implication of our model is that equity in tertiary enrollment is well out of reach at this time. There is no good reason to expect that national reading levels (for either sex) will be raised much in the coming decade. \n\nWhat they didn't measure, and what may have some effect, is whether the school environment is more geared towards girls aptitudes and behavior than it is boys.  Of course, this has to be approached without denigrating girl's abilities to thrive in school.  Such as by saying they are more obedient or compliant.  Girl's success in school should be seen as something to be emulated and admired, even if boys need a different way to achieve their own success. And I think things that make school more interesting to boys would probably help girls also. \n\nAnyone have their own ideas of what could help boys, what might be holding them back, etc.?  How important do you think reading is to school success?","title":"Gender differences in the pathways to higher education","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/nxusky\/gender_differences_in_the_pathways_to_higher\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

However, when used more carefully, it does describe real problems with the socialisation of men. \n\nThis is closely tied to another concept known as \"precarious manhood.\" The idea is that, in our society, manhood and the social benefits which come along with it are not guaranteed. Being a man is not simply a matter of being an adult male. Its something which must be continually proven.\n\nA man proves his manhood by performing masculinity. In this context, it doesn't really matter what is packaged into \"masculinity.\" If society decided that wearing your underwear on your head was masculine then that's what many men would do (Obviously not all. Just as many men don't feel the need to show dominance over other men to prove their manhood.). It's motivated by the need to prove manhood rather than anything innate to the behaviors considered masculine.\n\nThis leads to toxic masculinity. When we do things to reinforce our identities to ourselves or prove out identities to other people we often don't consider the harm these actions might have to ourselves or others. We are very unlikely to worry whether the action is going to actually achieve anything other than asserting that identity. The identity is the primary concern.\n\nThe things originally considered masculine were considered such because it was useful for society for men to perform them. However, decoupled from this motivation and tied instead to identity, they become exaggerated, distorted and, often, harmful. \n\nBut I think everyone reading this will be familiar with that concept. What I want to introduce is an analogous idea: Toxic feminism.\n\nBeing \"woke\" has become a core part of many people's identities. \"Wokeness\" is a bit hard to pin down but then so is \"manhood\". Ultimately, like being a man, You're woke if others see you as woke. Or, perhaps, if other woke people see you as woke.\n\nCall-out culture has created a situation similar to precarious manhood. Let's call this \"precarious wokeness.\" People who want to be considered woke need to keep proving their wokeness and there are social (and often economic) consequences for being declared unwoke.\n\nPerforming feminism, along with similar social justice causes, is how you prove your wokeness. Like masculinity, feminism had good reasons for existing and some of those reasons are still valid. However, with many (but certainly not all) feminists performing feminism out of a need to assert their woke identity, some (but not all) expressions of feminism have become exaggerated, distorted and harmful. \n\nI've deliberately left this as a bird's eye view and not drilled down into specific examples of what toxic feminism looks like. I'll leave those for discussion in the comments so that arguing over the specifics of each does not distract from my main point.","title":"Toxic Feminism and Precarious Wokeness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/b6ei0e\/toxic_feminism_and_precarious_wokeness\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

One says: \n\n>That chick can shake her ass all she wants it's that dude I'm trying to keep my kids safe from in that situation\n\nSo the woman's stripping in a deliberately sexual way, the man's chilling on the couch shirtless in a completely nonsexual way, and somehow he's the biggest threat. How does that make any sense? Additionally, do you think there's a reason so many people are more concerned about him than the woman, other than just because he's a man and she's a woman? \n\nBecause I'd really like to think there aren't so many people who still think that way.

He was fired and opened up a case. Case went to arbitration and preliminary hearings. Retired judge overseeing arbitration found his story more credible then the accusations. University ended up settling with him. Students, accusers and university continued to bring up allegations as truthful. He has opened up various arbitration settlements against the university over the same case and won them due to continued publishing of material related to the allegations. He continues to be termed as a rapist over social media and is now suing the accusers and student body as well as individual university employees for continued defamation.\n\nThe accuser here still believes she was raped by this professor. He believes that it was an affair and consensual. Being an employee of the university, he went to arbitration because that was likely a contract term and he received a settlement. Despite said settlement, the accusations continue. However, he can sue now that the defamation occurred after his employment.\n\nThere is defamation law that is very similar to the US in Canada where this took place.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1: Lots of times these settlements happen outside of a court room and while they make the main entities themselves (such as the university and the accused student) be silent as part of the settlement. The articles that came out about this in 2014-2015 had the accused names posted prominently and intentionally withheld disclosure of the accusers (although this articles has at least the main names for accusers and accused). What do you think the policy should be for censoring or posting names to the public about ongoing hearings?\n\n2: If the accusations are false, who is (or should be) liable for the comments? The university itself? The employees? The accusers? The student body? None of the above? If for example a professor says that this person raped someone as part of a lecture and one of those students goes on to repeat that statement on social media, should that student be liable if that statement turns out to be false?\n\n3: If the lawsuit is successful, do you think continued false statements from the same or additional entities will stop? What do you think the punishment should be? \n\n4: The article mentions the suit is seeking:\n>\u201crequiring the defendants to remove the defamatory words from the internet and every other public postings\u201d and restraining them from any further publishing.\n\nHow harsh would a social media ban be for students? As the internet has grown, this penalty has gone from \"who cares\" to impacting quite a number of actual positions and jobs. How would you (personally) feel about receiving a social media ban based a statement you made online?\n\n5: Any other thoughts?","title":"UBC professor accused of sexual assault, had settlement in his favor, now suing again due to continued allegations against him","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/9sh8jv\/ubc_professor_accused_of_sexual_assault_had\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

Not at all unreasonable.\n\nIt is unreasonable to hate men *in general* because *some* men in her life abused her \n\n - \"Misandry is rare.\"\n\n>i think actual cases of \"misandry\" are very rare. When they do exist, it may be a legitimate response to male violence.\n\nWhat is his metric for misandry being rare? Judging by the [amount of violence against men](http:\/\/www.unodc.org\/gsh\/en\/data.html), the [perception of violence against men](https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/MenAreTheExpendableGender), the negative stereotypes against males (e.g. that men are pigs, men are dogs, men are trash, boys are stupid, boys drool, men are violent \/ abusive, men can't be trusted with children [either because they're pedophiles or they're incompetent], etc.), I would say misandry isn't rare at all\n\n - \"Males are the oppressors in power and females are the oppressed with no power.\" \n\nIt's something many people take for granted, but it's highly debatable. In terms of who generally has more power, that depends on the situation. A man may generally be taken more seriously in the workplace or politics. A woman may generally be taken more seriously where it comes to children. A man may have more credibility than a woman where it comes to explaining a computer program. A woman may have more credibility than a man where it comes to making a rape accusation, or denying a rape accusation\n\nAnd often any kind of \"gender power\" is trumped by other factors. Generally a parent has power over its offspring, a teacher over a student, a supervisor over an employee, an adult over a child, etc. and any of these roles are held by either sex. For example, politicians being mostly men doesn't mean other boys or men aren't at risk of being abused by their mothers; or taken advantage of by female supervisors; or abused by their gf's \/ wives, having no shelters to go to, and losing custody of his children to a violent partner\n\n>Men have the power to abuse, rape and kill women. And too often, we get away with it.\n\nWhat does it even mean by \"men have *the power* to\"? The physical ability? The social ability? Either way, evidently women have the power to abuse, rape, and kill men, as well, since many of them have done precisely that. And when there is someone getting away with abuse because of gender, [it's not males](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002)\n\n - \"Men aren't at risk of violence by women.\" \n\n>Men have never been threatened by women to the extent that we threaten women. Women are more at risk to be raped and killed by men than vice-versa. And the comparison is not even close\n\nThis is not even close to the truth. It's just another thing people take for granted without thorough investigation. There is evidence of symmetry in both [domestic violence]( https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1854883\/) and [sexual violence]( https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/opinion\/2014\/09\/22\/rape-cdc-numbers-misleading-definition-date-forced-sexual-assault-column\/16007089\/). Of course statistics on these issues can never be completely accurate. But considering some factors that might make these numbers flawed (underreporting, how the questions are phrased in the study, respondents not wanting to perceive themselves as victims, etc.), if anything it seems more likely the amount of female abusers is underrepresented since [people abused by women tend to have a harder time talking about it](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14533025) than people abused by men\n\n>Women have reason to be angry (or \"hate\", if one insists) men. Men do not have any justification that is equally compelling. \n\nHe hasn't given a compelling reason for the former. The fact that a minority of men abuse women is no more compelling of a reason for women to hate men than the fact that a minority of women abuse men is a reason for men to hate women\n\n>Misogyny is predicated on lies and fictions about women; so-called misandry is predicated on the truth that men inflict incredible violence against women, and have done so throughout history.\n\nUnless he actually believes no women are evil and all men are evil, he's basically interpreting the fact that a minority of women do wrong to mean \"it's a lie that women are detestable\" and interpreting the fact that a minority of men do wrong to mean \"it's a truth that men are detestable\" \n\nIt's no more wrong for me to say \"misandry is based on false, prejudice negative stereotypes about men; so-called misogyny is based on that truth that women abuse men, rape under-aged boys, murder their children, and routinely get away with it\". And for my justification to be: most men aren't the negative stereotypes, so the basis of misandry is false; some women are abusers, so the basis of misogyny is true","title":"Quora feminist answers \"Why is misandry okay for some feminists?\" (My response)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/9izm0x\/quora_feminist_answers_why_is_misandry_okay_for\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

I reposted it to r\/MensRights and they generally didn't like it. I'm genuinely fascinated by gender politics and the bizarre battle of the sexes thing that goes on in society and especially the internet.^(1)\n\nHowever, I think many (though not necessarily all) of the issues between men and women discussed online are trivial and that many of the complaints both men and women in rich countries have are exaggerated. The average man and woman in the Western world both have a similar and relatively high standard of living (by global historical reckoning) and have achieved equality under the law.^(2)\u00a0Most complaints about unfairness are overstated and there are relatively few truly sex-selective issues, rather there are issues that disproportionately impact one sex. There are probably no issues that are truly 50-50 in how they impact men and women. Ultimately, the differences are more marginal, and thus the debates\u00a0*should*\u00a0be more on the margins and not the extremes. Many important gaps can be explained by rather benign factors related to individual choices (more men end up in prison but men are much more likely to be criminals) rather than patriarchy or misandry. I would be willing to forward that there are no decisive advantages to either being a man or woman, rather there are many small advantages and disadvantages that roughly balance out. For almost any complaint one group has there is a roughly parallel complaint the other group can throw back, although they are not always morally equivalent.^(3)\u00a0My ideal would be for feminists and MRAs to focus on creating a more fair society for everyone which means at times prioritizing women's issues and at other times prioritizing men's. This is closer to genuine egalitarianism.\n\nThis list illustrates how for every way one group struggles, there is a reasonable explanation, and\/or a counter complaint from the other group. Regarding all of these facts, there are deeper subtleties and nuances. A few sentences devoted to each issue can't fully capture all of the dynamics at play.\n\n* Men view women as\u00a0[sex objects](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2933005\/).

There is even an entire\u00a0[Wikipedia article](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orgasm_gap)\u00a0on it.\n\nThere are some caveats. My general views are really only applicable to the Western world and maybe some non-Western developed and OECD nations. There are some places where being a feminist is something I would support. I do think that at present men in the Western world have a\u00a0*slightly*\u00a0lower standard of living on average than women, at least by certain measures.^(4) I think male issues are taken less seriously and that generally speaking society has an\u00a0[innate pro-female bias](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00792.x)\u00a0that existed prior to and independent of the feminist movement (which has compounded it) and this results in much of our mainstream discourse focusing on women's issues. We simply spend more time focusing on unfairness towards women. I think that mainstream narratives have thus made it more difficult to discuss male issues let alone generate concrete solutions for them.^(5)\u00a0I'm unsure if men have an equivalent advantage. This does not mean there aren't a few areas where women have it worse but if women just one key advantage I do think this is it.\n\nAlso, there are some women's issues that are the result of biology that have no male equivalents such as\n\n* Menopause\n* Menstruation\n* The risk of getting pregnant from unprotected sex\n* Permanent damage from pregnancy\/childbirth\n\nSo, as it happens. I see men and women in the Western world as having it pretty good. Neither has a decisive edge over the other and both groups are politically empowered. The majority of issues that are discussed and debated are social and cultural issues not directly related to politics or law (I make exception for things like debates on the legality and ethics of circumcision, abortion, and medical autonomy). I worry about a [growing gap](https:\/\/www.economist.com\/international\/2024\/03\/13\/why-the-growing-gulf-between-young-men-and-women?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&utm_source=google&ppccampaignID=17210591673&ppcadID=&utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxeyxBhC7ARIsAC7dS3-RCKOz1TxrC3nXmyyIhkEpwtYr_sxxlJYiaDdL-lFMLI_43bh2f8caApYxEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) between the sexes ([that might be exaggerated](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/politics\/2024\/3\/13\/24098780\/politics-gender-divide-generation-z-youth-men-women)) as both male and female\u00a0[happiness declines](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/the-highlight\/2019\/11\/13\/20959863\/women-happy-chores-gender-gap)\u00a0and would encourage more empathetic discussion that revolves around fairness and not self-pity narratives where one group has to feel hopelessly victimized in a never ending victim Olympics.\n\n1. My post here is partially influenced by the book\u00a0[Don't Be a Feminist: Essays on Genuine Justice](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dont-Be-Feminist-Genuine-Justice\/dp\/B0BD3DFMMH)\u00a0by economist Bryan Caplan. He does not argue that one should be an anti-feminist. I am not arguing that people should become MRAs or anti-feminists. I'm actually somewhat more favorable to the historical feminist movement than he is.\n2. Some of this is contingent on your views towards bodily autonomy and how you feel about\u00a0[abortion rights](https:\/\/reproductiverights.org\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/World-Abortion-Map.pdf)\u00a0for women and the\u00a0[conscription](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conscription)\u00a0of men (and in some rare instances for women). On other platforms the most common negative responce from women is the claim that unless some certain threshold for abortion access is achieved they aren't really politcal equals with men.\n3. Men complain that women \"[don't approach](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/the-how-and-why-sex-differences\/201104\/why-dont-women-ask-men-out-first-dates)\" and that men often go ignored in the dating market and that women have lots of options. The female parallel would be too much\u00a0*unwanted*\u00a0attention. Being lonely isn't good but I don't see it as morally equivalent to too many \"romantic\" advances that are just sexual harassment.\n4. The U.N's go to for measuring living standards is the Human Development Index (HDI). I used an [online calculator](https:\/\/www.calculatorall.com\/human-development-index-calculator) to compare the 2019 standard of living of American women and men. Women came out [slightly better off](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XdbZhV9.png). I used yearly income instead of GDP per capita which the UN does because I think it's a better proxy for individual living standards. If you use GDP per capita the gap actually narrows with men doing a bit better. A common complaint from men I get on this is that I'm too pro-woman and don't \"get\" just how awful being a man is and how massively privileged women are. The world is a lumpy, random, and asymmetrical place so it was unlikely that men and women were going to, on average, have it the same. As it happens women do have it a bit better (regarding the HDI) but it's not some colossal difference MRA's claim it is.\n5. Hyperbolic narratives about how men \"dominate\" society or are always privileged relative to women are very counterproductive because they make it seem unfair to ever consider male issues. Even if feminists pay lip service to caring about male issues by arguing that fighting patriarchy serves to benefit men they aren't actually predisposed to helping a group they think is already privileged. At best this has made people indifferent to disproportionally male problems.","title":"The online gender war is mostly nonsense and talking past each other.

First, convicted female felony sex offenders, on average, look substantially different than convicted male felony sex\noffenders. As a group, female sex offenders presented to the court as younger, more likely\nto be white, and less serious offenders overall than male sex offenders. ...\n\n>  These findings also suggest that perceptions of female sex offending as less dangerous\nmay reflect, in part, documented differences in patterns of offending. \n\n> 2. Second, when perfectly matched across a host of demographic and legally relevant\nvariables, females convicted of sex offenses were significantly less likely than males to\ngo to prison. In other words, even when convicted male and female sex offenders\u2019 criminal acts look the same, they are treated differently\n\n> 3. Third, the results indicated that the pattern of male sex offenders receiving harsher punishment outcomes than females holds across offense type and victim type. That is, regardless of the degree of seriousness or violence of the sex offense, and regardless of whether\nthe offense was committed against an adult or a minor, females were significantly less\nlikely to spend time in prison than to be assigned a community sanction\n\nOne thought I have is that though they were attempting to match like for like as far as crimes, criminal records for other serious offenses was not the same.  I know that Pre-sentencing reports and recommendations will take prior records into account.\n\nAnd, I'm pretty sure that if a male was involved in any way in her crimes, that's going to be a way to absolve her of some responsibility.  For instance, if she was creating child porn to send to a male acquaintance online, she will be seen as being manipulated or coerced.   \n\nI am also reminded of another way male and female criminals are treated differently, at least by the press.  We want to know \"why?\" a female offender committed her crimes, not so much with male criminals.  It could be that if this way of looking at things extends to the courts, the wonder why may lead them to believe mental health issues played a role for women but not for men.  Thus, the appropriateness of community treatment for women.  \n\nLastly, I'd be interested in seeing a breakdown of the judges' sex.

We've seen careers end for some male figures in Hollywood (both in the spotlight and behind the scenes), we've seen some manage to keep their status but not without detractors, and some seem to have got away relatively unscathed. However, I still haven't seen one female perpetrator receive anywhere near the level of outcry the male celebrities have. People who, for whatever reason, feel the need to downplay or question the idea that women who perpetrate sexual harassment or abuse generally get a pass might say the things they are accused of are less severe, but in the next paragraph let's have a look at some recent allegations that have come to light.\n\nEarly on we had Mariah Carey being accused of sexual harassment (and I guess racial harassment? as well), I posted a thread about it on this sub [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/7bpx9u\/mariah_carey_accused_of_sexual_harassment\/). Carey was accused of appearing semi-nude, engaging in sex acts, etc. in front of her security guard. I suppose this could be dismissed as not that significant (but Harvey Weinstein showing up in a bathrobe is significant so..), and her defenders seem to say Michael Anello was a disgruntled employee seeking money, and it's not like Mariah Carey is known for being a nice person anyway. Ok, whatever. Next, we had The Voice's [Melanie Martinez accused of sexual assault by her former best friend](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/7bpx9u\/mariah_carey_accused_of_sexual_harassment\/). My understanding, from [following the discussion about it on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=melanie%20martinez&src=typd), is that some fans of hers did announce they will no longer be fans of her but many also came to her defense either questioning Timothy's (for the uninitiated Timothy is a woman) accusations or calling for society to be more willing to forgive those accused of sexual assault and say they're sorry or are otherwise rehabilitated. Then we had lesbian porn star Lily Cade being accused of [sexual assault and rape by multiple women](http:\/\/therealpornwikileaks.com\/lily-cade-apologizes-amid-sexual-assault-allegations\/). Despite multiple accusers, this received nowhere near the attention and public outcry James Deen's accusations got. More recently, [it has been revealed Jamie Luner is accused of drugging and raping an underage male actor while she was in her 20s](http:\/\/people.com\/tv\/jamie-luner-accused-sexual-misconduct-minor\/).\n\nThere have also been cases of female celebrities bragging about behavior that sounds an awful lot like sexual harassment. [Jennifer Lawrence on how she enjoys making men uncomfortable with her flirting](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/80o42r\/jennifer_lawrence_interview_on_the_late_show\/) and [Mindy Kaling bragging about forcing her tongue in male costars' mouths for onscreen kisses and how she's the boss and can get away with it](https:\/\/www.today.com\/popculture\/mindy-kaling-talks-kissing-sexually-harassing-co-stars-mindy-project-1C6923753). I would also like to point out Kaling said this in 2012 is her career has only improved since then, she's now starring in A Wrinkle in Time alongside Oprah (another #MeToo champion for her Golden Globes speech).\n\nIn politics there have been more consequences. [Andrea Ramsey stopped her campaign after it was revealed she had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit against her](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/12\/15\/us\/andrea-ramsey-harassment.html). And then of course we have probably the case of female perpetrated harassment that has received the most attention: Cristina Garcia, prominent #MeToo figure, has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple male coworkers. [Though she now dismisses the accusations as politically motivated.](https:\/\/www.kqed.org\/news\/11651502\/garcia-camp-alleges-political-smear-while-alleged-harassment-victims-prepare-to-sue).\n\nAnyway, it is good that there is at least willingness to report on these instances. I thought it might be good to post here to highlight and discuss them. If anyone has read my posts on this sub they would know I have been skeptical of the #MeToo movement, as I said in [another post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/7go2hi\/im_not_ready_for_the_redemption_of_men_amber\/dqkjh6p\/): \n\n>Those involved aren't calling for just wealthy, famous, powerful men who have been accused of mistreating others to be brought down. They're going so far as to say [it's fine if innocent men get punished](https:\/\/twitter.com\/EmilyLindin\/status\/933073784822579200), [all men are complicit in this](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/10\/19\/opinion\/metoo-sexual-harassment-men.html), [all men need to confess their crimes against women](http:\/\/www.gq-magazine.co.uk\/article\/harvey-weinstein-men-sexual-assault), it goes on and on. Much like how many pointed out at least some aspects of gamergate weren't really just about \"ethics in gaming journalism\" some aspects of this movement aren't just about ending workplace harassment. If they were, why not include victims of female sexual harassers, why so much disregard and outright contempt for establishing proof of accusations, etc.? \n\nTo be fair, I will add some positive aspects of the movement from my perspective. Occasionally the Hollywood figures will give lip service to women outside of Hollywood and it's nice that the reporters inspired by the movement are covering harassment of women in more blue collar fields like [manufacturing](https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/show\/ford-tackled-a-factory-harassment-culture-before-why-is-it-still-happening) or women in the [U.S. Forest Service](https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/nation\/tony-tooke-head-of-u-s-forest-service-stepping-down-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations). There seems to have been some interest in male victims as well. Recently Korean news sources have covered a report claiming [1 in 4 Korean men say they've been sexually harassed at work](http:\/\/english.chosun.com\/site\/data\/html_dir\/2017\/06\/05\/2017060500483.html?related_all), but they assert the perpetrators are probably mostly male.","title":"#MeToo and female perpetrators","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/83x9q7\/metoo_and_female_perpetrators\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

Both the person seeking advice and the person providing the advice agree that at least most men are worthy of contempt. And not even for raping, sexually assaulting, harassing, etc. but just for not dating them the right way or ghosting on them. I realize this isn't new and many who post here have observed these kinds of articles from various publications online for at least the past few years at this point but I have to say the mainstreaming of this attitude is really seeping into almost every website, publication, forum, etc. that I read online. It's starting to feel like I'm under assault. There's only so many times you can hear (x aspect of your identity you have no control over) is worthy of hatred. I also worked in academia where much of this kind of thing is becoming quite common (maybe not necessarily always in your face, but events on campus, lectures given, workplace banter and the general mood definitely is in line with the sentiments expressed in this piece, though it is not the case everywhere in academia). I mostly avoid women, I don't date (I am heterosexual), am careful not to do anything that could be perceived as coming on or creepy or w\/e, and I think I mostly slip through the cracks in terms of being targeted for hate. I do get left out of workplace banter and I think I've experienced some things that were definitely sexist if not quite sexual harassment.\n\nAnyway, I think most readers here are against this kind of thing and there's not much need in repeating why we're against it. I guess what I'm wondering is: \nfor men (feminist or not): do you feel hated by women because you're a man? If you're heterosexual how does it impact dating? Has it changed how you view women in your day to day life or your relationships with women in your life? \nfor feminists (male or female): Do you see this as a problem? Do you see this as totally separate from feminism or do you see a relationship with the resurgence of feminism being popular (hell, probably more popular than ever it seems)? If you subscribe to the belief that it is merely punching up and therefore a good (or at least harmless) thing at what point or in what context is it not punching up anymore?

He appears to run a blog discussing finance, mathematics, and statistics. It is unclear if he is involved in neo-Nazism, though I highly doubt it.\n\nI can't say I shed too many tears for Anglin, but this episode has started to make me think. Google is exerting a near-absolute power over our lives, and is acting in bad faith time and again. Can you imagine losing your entire email account without warning? It would do irreparable damage to our careers.\n\nIn the last few years, it has become fashionable on the Left to celebrate corporate power (\"The 1st Amendment only stops the government blah blah\"). Of course, this argument isn't applicable to Google: the check on corporate abuse is that in a free market, you can choose new corporations to conduct business with. With Google being gargantuan enough to lose [anti-trust suits](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/06\/27\/technology\/eu-google-fine.html), it's obvious that we have a case of market failure. If the market doesn't work, then an all-encompassing corporation is simply a totalitarian entity.\n\nBut regardless, the \"let corporations have unlimited power\" argument is still fashionable on the Left. Noam Chomsky's (an anarcho-communist) critique of corporations as [\"private tyrannies\"](http:\/\/www.ontheissues.org\/celeb\/Noam_Chomsky_Corporations.htm) couldn't be written today. Whatever our disagreements, I hope we can come together and agree that no single entity should have the power that Google does without public oversight.

The tool that men have used to oppress women for millennia is hurting men in the process. Therefore men don't *need* their own movement, because feminism already covers it.\n\nThere was always something that irked me about this logic, and I've finally put my finger on it:\n\n (1). We can all agree that the 'Patriarchy' is not caused by a single gender: Women are just as complicit in slut shaming as men, and women who insist on dragging down women who want to be individualist and career oriented are just as bad as the men who do it. \n\n (2).  We all agree that the 'Patriarchy' hurts both sides: Women are told that an essential part of femininity is being dumb, infantilized, and having to suppress their own sexuality; Men are told that deviance from the hyper heterosexual, materialistic and violent norm makes you unmanly.\n\n(3). We all agree that ending the 'Patriarchy' requires the work of both genders. All the feminist activism in the world would be useless if men still didn't take women seriously, and it requires women to actively try and change the system for anything to work.\n\n**So why must we call it 'The Patriarchy', instead of just \"The status quo\"?**. Given the above, there's *no* reason it needs to be such a gendered term - both men and women are hurt and neither are in control. Calling it 'The patriarchy' *only* serves to point fingers and place the guilt on men - which achieves nothing, silences men's issues, and generally distances half the world's population from the movement. It boils down to the attitude that women, because they're the victims, *are incapable of being the main cause of a given problem*. Calling it 'the patriarchy backfiring' when there's a pro-female bias in divorce courts, or men are expected to be sole providers, or male rape is largely ignored by society, is a *total fucking cop out*. It's often *women* who laugh at male rape, or emasculate men who don't want to pay for the whole date. Calling it 'the Patriarchy' ignores the harm that *female* culture, not in any way coerced or enforced by men, can be doing loads of harm.\n\n**tl;dr 'Patriarchy' is just a fancy way of saying 'Status Quo' except it points fingers at men for no real reason, silences men under the guise of helping them, drives huge numbers of people away from the movement, and only serves to enforce the Feminist victim mentality.**\n\nThoughts?\n\n","title":"What is this damn Patriarchy, anyway?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2bon6b\/what_is_this_damn_patriarchy_anyway\/","upvote_ratio":0.81,"over_18":false}

MRA's defend against this claim by saying that while there are less pleasant elements of their movement, it doesn't diminish what they're actually trying to say.\n\nThe MRM, on the flip side, seems to believe that while Feminists say nice, politically correct things so they look good, in reality the movement manifests itself as a hateful, bigoted, anti-men movement that doesn't care at all for the wellbeing of anyone except their own gender. Feminists frequently defend against this claim by saying that while there are outspoken feminist extremists, it shouldn't demean what the main part of the group is trying to say.\n\nIs it just me, or is this whole ordeal *completely insane*? Both groups are building up their own self serving image of the other in order to legitimize themselves to themselves.

But there was a time when I was an anti-feminist. And when I think back, I do remember experiencing a lot of what people complain about on here--some feminists used to be very intolerant, impatient, and unfair to me just because I didn't agree with them.\n\n\nThis wasn't a situation of anonymous internet comments, either. The feminists that I feel bullied me were classmates and even a few of my teachers. In high school, it was a big deal to be labeled a misogynist by your peers. When I found out that people were calling me that behind my back and to my face, I was very hurt.\n\n\nAt the time, my anti-feminism was mostly rooted in the fact that I felt feminism was too limiting in what it found to be acceptable. I consider myself to be a very feminine person and in high school, I was interested in a lot of feminine things and I expressed myself that way. I believed feminists were against my lifestyle and femininity. What confirmed this for me was when I rejected the label \"feminism,\" the feminists I knew called me a misogynist. \n\n\nFor me this was proof that their worldview was actually oppressive to women. \"What's wrong with wanting to be a housewife?\" I asked them. I remember one argument in class over the book *Bridget Jones.* Our teacher (Ms. S) argued that it was a sexist book because Bridget ends up with a man at the end. \"What's wrong with her being with a man?\" I asked, taking it on myself to be the one person in class to defend the book. \"How can there be anything wrong with a woman wanting love?\" I never felt that I got an adequate explanation.\n\n\nThinking back on this time in my life, I feel that the feminists I knew personally were unfair to me and did a very poor job of representing feminism. (However, I should note that I was not always fair to them--sometimes I made fun of feminism in hurtful ways.) Overall, I think that they were unwilling and unequipped to deal with opposing views. People are not born feminists. Feminism needs to be explained thoroughly to people who question it, even when people are not questioning it nicely. Challenging prevailing viewpoints is an important part of being a critically thinking person, regardless of whether feminism is true or false.\n\n\nWhen I graduated from high school and went to college I met a lot more people, including many feminists. I also met more anti-feminists. But as I read about feminist theory, I started to realize that the majority of feminism is positive and true. Feminism was actually something I agreed with and it fit with my goals for the future of society--a world where people are treated equally regardless of gender. I had denied that sexism against women still existed, but when I was confronted with facts and hard evidence that it still existed (often unconsciously), I was forced to change my mind.\n\n\nI even started to realize that I had some gender bias in my own mind, and after learning about feminism, I had the tools to improve that about myself. In fact I credit feminism with helping to fix one of my biggest flaws--I used to dislike many women for being \"slutty.\" However feminism made me realize that there is nothing immoral about liking sex or being a sexual person. Sex is actually something positive. This helped me make more female friends, since I became a more accepting person.\n\n\nOnce you are on the same \"side\" as feminists, you can more easily debate issues and disagreements within feminism. I learned there were different types of feminism and that I could find my own individual viewpoint within it. No surprise, I gravitated towards sex-positive feminism and 3rd wave feminism. 3rd wave feminism specifically supported feminine women like me, despite my previously false belief that feminism rejected women like me. Femininity could be an empowering choice made as an individual, instead of a mandatory gender role forced on all women. Feminism wasn't really about individual personal choices anyway, it was about removing societal barriers preventing people from making free choices about themselves. I wanted to be a feminine person, yes, but I wanted other women to be free to be un-feminine.\n\n\nIn college people are into progressive causes and I learned a lot about other progressive issues, too. I also came to learn what progressive communities (known to some of you as SJW) are like. In my experience progressive people are critically-thinking and care about important causes that are larger than themselves. However for some reason this makes many of them self-righteous and intolerant of people who haven't caught up to their views yet. Even as I became one of them, I disliked the self-righteousness. In high school, I had been on the receiving end of that self-righteousness, and it was not good.\n\n\n**What those feminists had said to me had been wrong. But it didn't make feminism wrong.** Sure, it would have made me feel good to reject Ms. S and everything she believed in forever because of the way she had treated me. But that would not be intellectually honest. Ms. S was not a nice person, but she was right about some things. If only she had bothered to explain them to me politely and without judgment.\n\n\nNow that I'm a feminist, I am equipped to answer my younger self's questions about *Bridget Jones*. No, it is not wrong that Bridget Jones the individual wants to find love. No, it does not make someone a misogynist to like and appreciate the book. The issue is that a book like *Bridget Jones*, looked at in the context of so many other books which involve a woman hoping to get married and being rewarded with marriage, and the absence of many books like that with a male protagonist, contributes to a stereotype. Books should reflect the diverse goals of women in general. No one book can accomplish this, though, so it's something that has to be accomplished through cultural change.\n\n\nFeminism does not have to be as self-righteous as some of its members are. I know that a lot of the people here are still on the receiving end of that negativity and I sympathize. That is why now that I am a feminist, I want to engage respectfully with opposing views. I hope other feminists do the same. And I hope that people who have experienced mistreatment don't let that get in the way of becoming feminist allies.\n\nedit: thanks for the gold! <3 Your support is really appreciated","title":"Why I became a feminist even though I was bullied by feminists as a teenager","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/3vbugx\/why_i_became_a_feminist_even_though_i_was_bullied\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

Do 50% (or more) of physical work in your home and a proportional share to your job.\n3. Consume cultural products based on their artistic and intellectual merits, not their maker's gender.\n4. Give men space. He deserves a night with the guys!\n5. ...but insert yourself into spaces where you can use your femaleness to interrupt sexism against men.\n6. When a woman tells you something is sexist, ask her why and **critically evaluate her argument.**\n7. Educate yourself about sexual consent and remember that **maleness is NOT consent** - you need to ask too, ladies!\n8. Be responsible for contraception, because **your contraceptive options are less visible than your partner's.**\n9. EDIT: Support research into men's healthcare and male contraception, which are both under-funded.\n10. Put respect before politics: If you and your male partner get married, and having a common surname with your spouse is important to **either of** you, don't expect him to change his surname just for gender-political reasons.\n11. Advocate paternity leave, family court fairness, and shared parenting so that fathers can be equal parents.\n12.

Don't assume that every failure to obey you is malicious or lazy. **You might actually be nagging.**\n24.

Offer to accompany male friends if they have to walk home alone at night\u2026or in a public space where they may be ~~likely to feel~~ unsafe, remembering that men are especially vulnerable to street violence.\n30. Don't inject feminism into your daily conversations; for Gloria Steinem's sakes we get the idea already!

Quite a bit more frequently lately related to the accusations against Kevin Spacey.\n\nThe worst example I've seen was [an article](http:\/\/thoughtcatalog.com\/mike-damora\/2012\/06\/no-means-no-no-matter-who-says-it\/) in 2012 on Thought Catalog where the author recounted an harrowing incident where a woman he knew violently tried to rape him (including biting a chunk out of his cheek in the process). The highest ranking comment at that time was a comment stating: \n\n>The sad part is, no one will ever ask you what you were wearing and how much you had to drink\n\n\nThat that's considered *the sad part* rather than, you know, the violent rape attempt itself is quite indicative of the commenter's lack of empathy with the male victim.\n\n\nAs I said, lately after Anthony Rapp told his story about Kevin Spacey there has been quite a few comments and tweets like [this](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/0e8qB) gaining some traction.\n\n\n \nAside from the irony in basically blaming victims for not being blamed I have a quite different take on the point these people try to make.\n\nYes, too many people think that a woman wearing 'provocative' clothes implies her consent. That is why they ask the victim-blaming questions ranging from: \"What was she wearing?\" to the even more blaming \"What did she expect, wearing those clothes?\"\n\n\nA want to *not* believe that the perpetrator in fact did perpetrate (he seems like an upstanding guy etc.) also contributes to this.\n\n\nI find this connotation between clothes and consent to be harmful and I support attempts to fight this connotation.\n\n\n\nHowever, male victims (and perhaps in particular male victims of female perpetrators) have their consent implied *regardless* of what clothes they wear. To me and other survivors this comes across as \"consider yourself lucky\" which is awfully familiar to many male victims - perhaps in particular those with female perpetrators. It comes across as more of a #NotYou than a #MeToo. \n\n","title":"At least no one asked him what he wore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/7bsdwe\/at_least_no_one_asked_him_what_he_wore\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

Basically, the claim is feminism is needed and MRA's are not because every discrimination males face are really just extensions of misogyny, and feminism fights misogyny, therefore feminism (indirectly) fights men's issues\n\nThe issue I have with this and the whole discussion there is that it's entirely one-sided and presumptuous. I don't entirely disagree that misogyny is a factor in some issues, but it is not the only factor the way the OP and the people on that subreddit claim\n\nExamining some of the issues mentioned:\n\n- \"Men shouldn't play with children.\" They claim it's misogyny because of the idea that a woman's role is to be with children. This is partly true, but it's also true that one reason men aren't trusted or are looked at suspiciously for liking kids 'too much' is because of the fear that such men are covert child molesters trying to get better access to children, and the reason women are so easily trusted with children is because of the idea that women don't do things like that\n\nThis fear of males as being potential predators (and ignorance about the possibility of females of being potential predators) is certainly misandry rather than misogyny. It's based on negative stereotypes about males--that they're predatory and dangerous--and positive stereotypes about females--that they're loving and nurturing\n\n- Clothing restrictions, or not precisely \"restrictions\" but how a lot more styles are socially unacceptable for men. They don't get into details, but some things I can think of are how men with long hair are stigmatized, where women can have short or long hair; men can't wear dresses \/ skirts but women can wear suits; men can't wear makeup; boys can't play with dolls but girls can play sports; etc. \n\nTheir conclusion is that this is misogyny because people don't like seeing males behave as females because femininity is seen as inferior. Again, this could play a role, but saying misogyny is the sole cause of why society is so restrictive towards what behavior is acceptable in males is very limited thinking\n\nIt's a bit like saying \"women in Saudi Arabia must wear hijabs when going out to avoid sexual assault. This is actually all misandry and not 'misogyny' because it stereotypes all men as rapists and really it's done to protect women, not because they hate women!\" \n\nClearly such a sentiment would be biased, because even though it may be partly true that part of it is because of the stereotype that stranger men are dangerous for women to be around thus women need to be protected by covering themselves, concluding that it's *entirely* because of this and none at all because of misogyny is only looking at part of the picture. This person does the same thing by concluding that restrictive gender roles for males is *entirely* because of misogyny and none because of misandry \n \n- Marginalization of male sexual assault victims of female perpetrators. One popular comment is:\n>If he's mocked for being assaulted by a woman, it's a result of misogyny, because women are 'supposed' to be the weak victims, not men.\n\nThis is a fairly common argument: female-on-male sexual violence is not taken seriously because people say women are the weak ones. This is partly true, but it's also true that it's not taken seriously because of the negative stereotype that all males are sex crazed perverts who are \"always willing\" and therefore can't be raped by women, because they're always looking to get into women's pants anyway. This prejudging all males as always being after 'one thing' from women is misandry, not misogyny\n\nI believe both misogyny and misandry play a role in many men's issues and women's issues, and not accepting the existence of misandry will hinder ever being able to fully understand and address these issues","title":"Most popular post on 2XC claims all men's issues stem from misogyny, thus men also need feminism and not the MRM.

This morninga n article titled *When Girls Attack* published on *The Good Men Project* was posted to [\/r\/mensrights](http:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/2ennz4\/victimblaming_good_men_project_article_tells_men\/), I thought this article would be a good discussion topic for this sub. By the time I got to work, the article had been deleted from *The Good Men Project*, it took place less than 2 hours after being posted to the mensrights sub. I think that this article warrants discussion so I have included it's contents in this post, even though a cached version of the article is still currently available via Google, it won't be available forever.\n\n> ##When Girls Attack##\n> \n> AUGUST 25, 2014 BY TALISA 3 COMMENTS\n> \n> ###How to let the gentleman inside you shine through in times that may make you feel like being anything but.###\n>  \n>  She may scream, punch, take advantage or just quietly manipulate you.\n\n>  The stereotype may be used against you by being told to provide or take care of needs; making you feel guilty, ashamed and less of a man\u2014but please don\u2019t feel this way.\n\n>  It may have nothing to do with you or maybe you did do something to provoke; either way how do you handle the attack?\n> \n>  If the \u2018attack\u2019 on you is a once-off behavior there may be something deeper going on resulting in this. In this instance it might be best to leave the situation in the heat of the moment and try coming back at a calmer time to talk it out\u2014this conversation can be started by simply asking how everything is going.\n>  \n>  However, if an inappropriate behavior is continually received you have to handle it. We are adults and whilst we don\u2019t always act our best, mature conversations when things are not quite right is the outcome we need to strive for, whether it is in the workplace, home or a social setting.\n>  \n>  Manipulative or snide comment behavior needs to be confronted with a calm approach. Find an appropriate setting, maybe invite the other out for a coffee or the like, and simply bring up the behavior, how it isn\u2019t acceptable and ask \u2018how can \u2018we\u2019 work this out?\u2019 This approach, whilst often difficult is one of the best deflators.\n>  \n>  Unfortunately sometimes the other party isn\u2019t willing to move towards a mature attitude. In that instance it is best to remove yourself from this association as much as possible when you have made reasonable attempts to work it out. If someone doesn\u2019t have your best interest at heart than it isn\u2019t healthy to continue to let him or her be an influence in your life, as we are all influenced by those around us.\n>  \n>  And this is hard, walking away always is because there were good reasons you walked into it. But that is part of being a good man, knowing when to walk away at a mature time, not letting it get to a point that grinds you down, as this is when regrettable behaviors come out.\n>  \n>  Remain calm, take moments to keep you together and mentally prepare yourself for these hard talks. As even when the mud is slung, you need to be prepared to be the one to show compassions, care and maturity.\n>  \n>  Often bad behavior can gain momentum with others and you need to be able to hold strong to your mature approach even when it is not visible to others, especially then, keep strong.\n>  \n>  But in your humanness, if you do falter in this you need to acknowledge it.  Apologies are in order no matter hard you may find them.  You need to acknowledge when your behavior isn\u2019t at its best, confirm you know this and are working on it, and try to explore the trigger so both parties can better understand and prevent this next time.\n>  \nThere is such strength in acknowledgment and acceptance, this paves the way for growth; it almost always ensures it.\n> \n>  Don\u2019t starve the world of your growth and the gentleman inside you\u2014don\u2019t run or fight back from situations where possible. We don\u2019t need any more immaturity, we need wisdom, and a gentle touch, and if need be, we need to move on from things that may no longer serve us. \n> \n> ---\n> \n> ###About TaLisa###\n> TaLisa is the author of blog [SenseOfYou.com](http:\/\/senseofyou.com\/), where she shares her articles on everyday experiences, minimalism, and on the relationships we have with ourselves and others.

[1]\n\nThe whole article seems to blame the victim of the abuse and make it their responsibility to deal with the issue. \n\nDon't defend yourself, just be calm and walk away. Remember, you may have done something to provoke the attack. If you do defend yourself, raise your voice, or say something in the heat of the moment, then you need to be the one that apologises.\n\nIt's not that simple, if you look at the stories told in quantitative studies of male victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) you'll see that expressed in their *own words*.\n\nJust being calm can actually make things worse.\n\n> Steve: She\u2019d come up very close to me and she kept on saying, \u2018go on, hit me, that\u2019s what you want to do, hit me, go on\u2019. I was trying to get her to calm down. But she couldn\u2019t stand that \u2013 it would make her twice as bad if I spoke in a calm voice. [2]\n\nIn fact, being calm and reasoned in the face of abuse is one of the identifying characteristics of male victims.\n\n> ###4) Characteristics of Male Victims###\n>\n> O\u2019Donnel feels that female abusers tend to look for male victims who are either very logical or very idealistic. The abusive woman needs something immovable in the man\u2019s mind which she can destroy. An English research study on thirty eight battered men states: \u2018the majority of men who are abused are not seven-stone weaklings with Amazonian partners. They tend to be well built, but not aggressive. They\u2019re the sort of men who don\u2019t want to hit a man, let alone a woman. So when the violence starts they know they are just going to have to stand there and take it, and that tension produces its own kind of terror\u2019 (Wolff 1992 cited in Peloche 1999 p.6). Detective Inspector Sylvia Aston describes the victims of female violence as the most decent kind of men, the kind who would not hit back. But they feel weak because they think that they should hit back (Thomas 1993 p.213).\n> \n> Elizabeth McMahon, a counsellor of sexual abuse victims in Melbourne, states \u2018In the case of women who sexually abuse, the victim is in years of sexual bondage before telling anyone\u2026. The male being sexually abused by a female is usually a very vulnerable personality who feels absolute shame and worthlessness\u2019 (Thomas 1993 p.138).\n> \n> Many of the participants in the study fitted the above descriptions. They were quietly spoken, non-aggressive men. When they were being attacked they exercised restraint, either removing themselves from the vicinity or reasoning with their partner in an attempt to calm her down.\n> \n> The situation of powerlessness in which the men found themselves both enabled the abuse to occur and was an integral part of the way in which they responded. [2]\n\nWalking away is actually easier said than done in a lot of cases.\n\nSometimes they stay to protect their children from abuse.\n\n> Husband: I could not leave her despite all this.... I often relied on her support, sometimes even for the food I ate and the house I lived in. This is when I was unemployed, but most of the time I earned enough to support my family. But my most serious concern was the children.\u2026 Well, a kick and a punch and a bruised eye ... so what, I can handle this, I thought then. I thought at least I was close to my kids who need me, and that was enough for me!\n> \n> Wife: He drank a lot and used to spend my money, the hardearned money to drink with his friends.... Not much, but enough to make me angry. Well, I was not violent against him; I just pushed him around a bit, that is true, but he made me really angry and I had to do something about it, and I had to protect myself, because he beat me badly several times, and I had to go to the hospital, ... and I had to go to the police several times ... I had to stop him from doing this to me.\n> \nSon: He was a pussycat; that\u2019s how his friends used to call him! He never stood up for himself, and he had to take it the hard way.\u2026 A slap and a kick would have been a blessing. The only teeth he lost all his life were those punched out by Mom.\u2026 Things were rough those days, and all of us suffered, most of all Dad.... He had to be hospitalized twice; that\u2019s what I know of, at least\u2026. I remember Mom stressing when we went to the hospital that if we were to be asked about dad\u2019s injuries we had to say he fell down the stairs.\u2026\n> \n> Mother: He was a bit of a nuisance, sometimes, not violent but irritating! Annoying, yes, but not dangerous. [laughs] I had him often in my house after he had a \u201cbang\u201d [fight] with Lalitha. He used to come to me because he didn\u2019t want to worry his parents and because the first place for her to look for him would have been his parents. He was hurt a lot, the poor guy, and they [abused husbands] have nowhere to go, do they...? [3 pp 285]\n\nSometimes they stay to attempt understand the abuse and to get help for the perpetrator.\n\n> his focus really was what is actually happening for her ... he certainly wanted to check out what was going on for her probably more than what was going on for him (SO05) [4 pp 43]\n\nIf they do leave or try to get help it is often denied to them by those in a position to be able to assist them.\n\n> so he went for a restraining order he walked into the court and the judge turned around and told him you\u2019re a big boy you can take care of yourself, so basically he walked out of that and he felt like a bloody idiot (SO5). [4 pp 37]\n\nAnd in the words of an IPV service provider, other providers intentionally withhold information on some of the resources available to male victims of IPV. \n\n> So if there is going to be a any kind of relationship issue that legal aid might be required or a legal centre or any service they are always going to be the first ones there because they know about it and the other person is dependent on the information that is given to them and that is another form of abuse like withholding information and that happens a lot as well that you to maintain power and control they only give the information that it suits them to give so you have got people that don\u2019t have all the choices at their finger tips and they aren\u2019t even aware of it (SP06) [4 pp 20-21]\n\nAnd some service providers such as state run health services don't even acknowledge that male victims exist, again in the words of an IPV service provider.\n\n> My health service does not recognize intimate partner abuse of men. Our admission assessments provide specific screening tools to identify female victims, but completely ignore males. This is despite the admission of males who clearly are victims of intimate partner abuse, sometimes witnessed by staff on the Unit. As far as I know there are no services up and running who do effectively help male victims of IPV. [4 pp 61]\n\nAnd where children are involved, walking away or leaving the family home can have a significant impact on who gets awarded custody of the children.\n\nAll the advice contained in this article encourages male victims of IPV to stay in an environment where they will be exposed to further abuse.\n\n1.

The main issue that I have with the article is how the author presumes that it's a one-sided decision: that the man forces the woman to take on the childcare role against her will so that he can work instead. She pretends as if it's never the case that...\n\n1. ...it's a mutual decision that the couple came to\n2. ...the man would also like to spend more time with his children, but is expected to provide for the family\n\n>Americans need to stop believing that women do the majority of care work because we want to.

There are indeed some women who enjoy being housewives, who take pride in being mothers and raising children, etc.. It's simply unrealistic to pretend all of them are forced into that role, and that they'd rather be working (esp. considering how often people don't even like their jobs, either)\n\nSecondly, her claim can just as well be reversed.

That is not the case.\n\nThat is 100% the case. In terms of everything from what's socially acceptable for men to wear, to what hobbies a man can have, to what toys a boy can play with, to how much interaction a man's allowed to have with children, to how much flirting he's allowed with the opposite sex before it's considered creepy, to what modifications his parents are allowed to force on his genitals when he's born, to how many rights he has as a citizen before signing up to offer his body to the government, men and boys are certainly policed and constrained even more so than are women\n\n>[Internalized misogyny] is as simple as a woman being prouder of her feminine side, than other qualities which appear to be more masculine. \n\nIt's funny how when people dislike feminine qualities in men, it's blamed on \"misogyny\". And yet when people dislike masculine qualities in women, it's still blamed on \"misogyny\"\n\n>It is very evident that the courage of women has grown. It is now easier for women to shout out \"male tears\", \"I hate all men\", and the infamous, \"All men are trash\".\n\n\"Misandry doesn't exist, and when it does it's courageous\"\n\n>What women have done is to humorously attack men. This defense mechanism is as a result of the centuries of oppression that has been lashes out against the female.\n\nSo it's okay to be prejudice, if a person feels it's faced prejudice\n\n>It is too simple for a woman to walk around boldly with a blouse with the word misandrist, clearly printed on it. Let a man do the same, and watch his world and credibility crumble to bread crumbs. The difference with these two situations, is the relativity of power held by one.\n\nRight. Considering that a man will have his world crumble for being a proud misogynist and a woman will face relatively no consequences for being a proud misandrist, it's very clear who has the power in this situation\n\n>Women have not been the ones imposing dangerous stereotypes on men.\n\nYes, a lot of times they do. It's not just men who say things like \"it's men's duty to protect women\"; that if a woman's violent towards a man, \"he did something to deserve it\"; that \"guys are always willing\"; etc. \n\n>The female\u2019s very reputation, credibility and capability hinges on the words uttered by men\n\nAnd the inverse isn't true? There aren't men who's reputations are ruined because a woman accused him of rape or domestic violence? \n\n>Ironic misandry uses humor as a defense mechanism to greatly satirize the perception that the growth of mainstream feminism has led to women now hating men...Whenever a woman says all men are trash, all men are evil, it is not representative of the whole.\n\nNo, whenever a woman says \"all men are trash\" or \"all men are evil\" or \"all men are pigs\" she's being prejudice and misandric. It's motte and bailey to claim \"they don't really mean it\"\n\n>By effectively using all, it not only represents a majority, but it is also a call for change.\n\nExcept that it's a minority of men, not a majority, who abuse or subjugate women. Even in an article claiming to denounce misandry, the author can't help making misandric claims\n\n>I believe that though it may be harsh it pushes for more accountability.\n \nThere is an accountability gap between men and women. But it's not men who are the ones generally not held accountable for their actions due to their gender\n\n>While being demeaning and defamatory doesn\u2019t solve the injustices, it comes out of a place of powerlessness\n\nNo it doesn't, because women are not powerless. Mothers have power over their children, female teachers have power over their students, female supervisors have power over their employees, a lot of times women have power over their SO's, and whatever abuse a woman can't inflict personally often she can manipulate white knights or the system (e.g. false accusations, custody battles) to inflict for her \n\n>When a woman says, \u201cmen are trash\u201d, it is in no way an indicative of a less superior.

[Here's](https:\/\/www.judiciary.gov.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/equal-treatment-bench-book-february2018-v4.pdf) the full book\n\nAs if the [disproportionate sentencing disparity](https:\/\/www.ussc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf\/research-and-publications\/research-projects-and-surveys\/miscellaneous\/15-year-study\/chap4.pdf) between men and women weren't already wide enough, it seems this \"equality\" group wants to widen it farther\n\nEven if financial hardship, drug \/ alcohol problems, taking care of kids, or trouble pasts were valid mitigating factors, then the guidance for sentencing should be to take into consideration those mitigating factors, not gender. Because there are surely male criminals with those problems and female criminals without them\n\nTreating those situations as mitigating factors could still mean disproportionately less women in prison, if it were true that female criminals were more affected by them. But it would infinitely better than saying \"because you're a woman, I'm going to *assume* you're a pitiful victim of circumstance and so deserve a lighter sentence\" \/ \"because you're a man, I'm going to *assume* you've always had a perfect privileged life with no drug \/ alcohol problems and no kids to take care of, and so deserve to be punished more harshly\"\n\nThe claim that prison is \"more damaging\" to women is also something that would have many better solutions than simply not putting female criminals in prison. Where the \"damage\" is objective, as in there are actual things that make it more difficult--e.g. I heard something about pads \/ tampons being difficult to obtain; or women's prisons more often being farther away from their actual homes--then the solution is to fix those problems within the prison system [the obvious solution to the latter being to open up more women's prisons, to send a female criminal to one closer to where she lives], not to allow criminals to go free with no consequences\n\nIf the damage is subjective (e.g. female criminals reporting feeling more traumatized after prison than men) then that's really too bad, but ultimately irrelevant. Any one can report feeling any kind of way. A female criminal could just be playing the victim, giving some sob story about how hard her life was and how horrible prison is, hoping to get off easily. A male criminal can say that he's less affected by the experience than he was or not mention past abuse in order to not appear or feel like a victim. Since there's no certain way of knowing, how a prisoner feels about prison should not be used as a measure of what a person's prison sentence should be\n\nWhy should a prisoner's sentence not be based on the severity of the crime she committed, rather than how prison affects her? Criminals are imprisoned for the benefit of society, not for their own well-being. And some could argue for a more rehabilitative system, but again: not a women's issue\n\nThe overall idea of women getting leniency to make up for social disadvantages is presumptuous. It's not as if women are disadvantaged in all areas, and one area where they're generally not, and are more likely treated unfairly favorably, is the [Criminal Justice System](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002)","title":"\"New guidance states real equality means favouring women and minorities.

I don\u2019t think this is a controversial observation. If you\u2019ve had sex more than once, and especially with more than one partner, you\u2019ve probably noticed this dynamic. If you haven\u2019t, or if you\u2019re here to argue basic observations without engaging meaningfully, this post probably isn\u2019t for you.\n\nFor those still here, let\u2019s talk about the societal pressures this creates for both men and women. Men are often shamed for not \"lasting long enough.\" Terms like \"3-second man\" or \"2-pump chump\" are thrown around casually, attaching a value judgment to something that\u2019s supposed to be about connection (though I\u2019d argue it doesn\u2019t always have to be). On the flip side, if a woman doesn\u2019t climax, it\u2019s also seen as a failure\u2014but the blame can fall on either her or her partner. We don\u2019t blame women when men climax quickly, so why is there this asymmetry when the roles are reversed?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of nuance here. Women might not orgasm for a variety of reasons: lack of communication, stress, or simply needing different stimulation. And yes, there are stereotypes like \"pillow queens,\" but even when these are discussed, it\u2019s rarely in a way that shames women\u2019s sexuality. Meanwhile, men are often ridiculed for not meeting unrealistic expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s important to bring up a key issue related to feminism\/blue pill ideology\u2014it has increased inequalities rather than reduced them. Even in this space, sex is often framed as something men do and that happens to women. While we have things like slut walks and other forms of empowerment, the focus has shifted to \"women behaving like men\" rather than a more self-focused approach, like using a mirror to explore one's own body and develop an understanding of feminine sexual power. But where is the expectation that women take an active role in their own fulfillment?\n\nAll of these perspectives suffer from the same flaw: when only one gender is expected to change, neither can truly do so effectively.\n\nIn that vein, to create better and more equitable sex, I have to ask: Why do you think this double standard exists? Is it rooted in traditional gender roles, societal expectations, or something else entirely? Most importantly, why is it so hard to change?\n","title":"The Orgasm Gap: A Double-Edged Sword for Men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1j9tr2y\/the_orgasm_gap_a_doubleedged_sword_for_men\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

Whereas 81.6% of respondents believed false reports for males to be less than 10%, only 56.9% of respondents believed this to be the case for females. Specifically, whereas 10.7% respondents believed at least 20% of reports by males to be false, this more than doubled to 22.3% for female victims.\n\n.As far as rape myths that were endorsed.\n\n> Nearly half agreed that when women rape, it is due to the fact they are sexually frustrated. **This is troubling given that feminist scholars have successfully argued that rape is not about sex but rather power, yet for male victims, this recognition is lagging**\n\nThis is a good point.  It doesn't do women any favors either to deny that we can have power and to deny that we are full human beings who can misuse that power.\n\n>  In addition, one third would have a hard time believing that a male could be raped by a female. This lends credibility to other scholars who have argued the conceptualization of the male offender\u2013female victim has resulted in far slower progress in the recognition of male victims and female perpetrators due to a lack of societal recognition and institutional neglect (Graham, 2006; Mezey & King, 1989; Rumney, 2007).\n\nThis is why I think consent classes, lessons about dating violence in high school, and promotional material for rape services should all be careful to avoid painting females as victims and males as perpetrators.  To repeat a point, this isn't even helpful to women, though people think it is helpful.  Women need to know they can be abusers also.  \n\nPeople also think a man isn't harmed by rape, especially rape by a woman.  That involuntary erection or ejaculation mean the man wanted it and enjoyed it.  This is an especially troubling myth since it has come up in court proceedings and used against male rape victims.  Men are blamed if they don't fight back.  A large proportion of male victims report freezing and becoming helpless and submissive during the attack.  \n\n>  A number of demographic variables have been found to be related to rape myth adherence. The most consistent finding in the literature relates to gender\u2014males are significantly more likely to adhere to rape myths (Davies et al., 2012; Davies & McCartney, 2003; Kassing & Prieto, 2003; Nalavany & Abell, 2004; Rosenstein, 2015; Sleath & Bull, 2010; Struckman-Johnson & Struckman-Johnson, 1992). Researchers have also found that those who are older (Kassing et al., 2005; Nalavany & Abell, 2004; cf. Rosenstein, 2015), less educated (Kassing et al., 2005), and identify as heterosexual (Davies & McCartney, 2003) have higher levels of rape myth acceptance.1 Only one study examined race and found that individuals who were White had lower levels of rape myth acceptance (Rosenstein, 2015)\n\nWhether a person holds myths about female rape is the strongest predictor as to whether the person will hold myths about male victims.  It appears that older men with conservative traditional beliefs are the most likely to hold the myths.  Unfortunately, older men be the judges, the law makers, the commanding officer, or the police detective that men may need to turn to for help.","title":"\u201cMen Cannot Be Raped\u201d: Correlates of Male Rape Myth Acceptance","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/kopxt6\/men_cannot_be_raped_correlates_of_male_rape_myth\/","upvote_ratio":0.96,"over_18":false}

I never see a response with some sort of proof, and more importantly, I cannot recall ever seeing white men under attack.  \n\nThese exchange stick out to me, because I also have this general feeling like the media blames white men and that we are under attack, but each time it comes up, I can't figure out why I feel this way.  I know I can go digging on any MRA subreddit or forum and they could helpfully dig up plenty of articles where people talk badly about men, but I could do the exact same thing for people blaming feminists, minorities, and aliens.  If I have to go digging for the articles it doesn't seem like it is a mainstream issue.\n\nSo, the question has been bugging me about why I feel like my race and sex is being blamed when I can't actually point to mainstream evidence of it being blamed.  Then the New York Times sent a mobile notification for this Article [link](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2017\/01\/13\/us\/politics\/trump-cabinet-women-minorities.html)  with the headline \"Trump\u2019s Cabinet So Far Is More White and\nMale Than Any First Cabinet Since Reagan\u2019s\"  and I realized something.  This headline is a pure statement of fact with no judgement or any adjectives to make the fact a positive or negative, but reading it, I know without a doubt that the presence of more white men is considered a bad thing.  If the headline had read \"Trumps cabinet contains more (black men\/women\/minority women) than any cabinet since X\" I would be sure that the article would be talking about how it is a good thing.  (Unless I was reading a strongly racist or sexist website, then gains for minorities would be seen as a bad thing.)  The headline does not in any way say white men are bad, but I understood that their presence is bad.\n\nI have been thinking about this a few days now, and mulling it over and it bothers me.  I know that discrimination is still a thing, and that in a perfect world we should see a more even distribution of sex and race at the top.  However, in that headline, my race and sex are synonymous with bad.  In fact, I think that almost any time the news brings up the race and sex of a person like me, those are going to be brought up as negatives.  Thanks to the whole \"privilege thing\" my race and sex are invisible to me normally.  However, when they stop being invisible, they are probably also being used as a shorthand for \"the bad group.\"\n\nThinking it over even more, I think a big part of the issue is that a lot of areas where we look at the percentage white men as measuring stick of progress, we look in areas that are fixed in size.  For example, % of fortune 500 CEOs, % of congress, % of the top X of the economy.  These areas that are fixed in size are a zero sum game when it comes to demographics.  This means that gains for minorities are at the same time losses for white men, and I think this shows in how those gains and losses are reported. \n\nWhat does everyone else think?","title":"Why do white men feel oppressed?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/5q4duf\/why_do_white_men_feel_oppressed\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

Like this:  I was moderating two message boards at the time, one of them about feminism--this one guy came around pretty regularly to the latter, he *clearly* did not like feminism, but somehow he and I still managed to communicate fairly successfully, even occasionally conceding a point to each other.  And one day, he PM'd me and said, \"You should really come over to this site I'm involved in.  It focuses on men's rights.\"\n\n\"Dude,\" I said, \"they couldn't possibly want a *feminist* to invade their space--\"\n\n\"No, they're fine with it,\" he said.  \"It says so in the rules--'feminists welcome.'  I just think you'd enjoy it.  You do have a fairly open mind, for a feminist. I think you'd really find it enlightening.\"\n\nWell...I *still* felt like a party crasher, but...I had to admit I was dying of curiosity.  \"Men's rights?\"  What on earth could they possibly have to talk about..?  What rights *didn't* men have..?  So I nipped over, lurked for a bit (wowza--it was about a million miles away from the well-behaved, not to say ladylike! dynamics of the feminist space I moderated!), and then stuck a toe in, via a comment or two.\n\nAt first they freaked out, feminist-welcoming sidebar or no--luckily for me, the guy who'd talked me into coming by for a visit corroborated my story that I was an invitee, not a random feminist troll, and even put in a good word for me (\"for a *feminist,* you know, she's all right!\") so, no ousting campaigns were immediately set into motion. :)  \n\nI probably hung out there for at least two years, maybe as long as four--I can't remember anymore exactly, but it was quite a while.  And oh, it was an *education.*  \n\nHere are some of the things I learned: \n\n1. If the only men you ever met in your whole life were those MRAs in their own personal spaces, you would think that misogyny is *far* more rampant among the male population than it actually is.  I mean, active, outright, rage-filled misogyny, not \"benevolent sexism\" or anything like that.  Whew!  Dudes would post, for example, random pictures of women  with toilet plungers stuck to their faces or bent over toilets with men's boots planted on their necks or naked crying women with a variety of objects stuck in their orifices and get nothing in response but a flood of enthusiastic, positive responses.  It used to *seriously* gross me out, and was probably the thing that regularly brought me closest to throwing in the towel and leaving them to their own devices.  (I didn't, though, I *still* felt like I had so much to learn, I couldn't leave *yet...*)\n\n2. There are female MRAs.  Yeah, I know, you *all* know that, but believe me, it came as a shock to me back then!  Admittedly, not too many!  But, there were two who were active posters on the site during the time I was there.  One of them treated me with the tolerant, affectionate contempt you'd show a bright but ignorant kid sister; the other one pretty much hated my guts, much more than at least half of the guys there did.  \n\n3. One of them figured out enough about me to hunt down my MySpace page (now *that* dates this story, doesn't it? :) ) and posted my profile pic on the MRA site, and oh, my.  It's funny how some of them changed their attitude towards me.  It made me realize how much effect how you look, as a woman, has on the (heterosexual) men who interact with you--not just men who are trying to date you (none of those guys were trying to date me!) but just in general.  They actually got in a heated argument amongst themselves about how I looked and what effect it was, wasn't, should or shouldn't have on how they treated me.  Fascinating to watch. :) \n\n4.  Probably the most important thing of all--I am ashamed, now, of my initial unthinking reaction (that I at least didn't share with the guy who invited me over!) of *What could they possibly have to talk about..?*  Well, a lot.  I'd had rather a strawman view of the *male experience,* which considering I'd been married to a man for close to a decade already, wasn't cool.  Now, of *course* I saw *him* as an individual human being with issues and vulnerabilities--but not as a *man* with them, nor did I ever consider how his gender might have influenced them.  I had just thought of *male* as *default.*  Men had problems, of course they did! but not because they were *men!* They had problems for all the other reasons a person can have problems, but not *that* one.  \n\nI learned about divorce, and fatherhood, and loneliness, and fears and pressures I'd never remotely experienced as a woman.  I learned that in the joy of making progress for womankind, I'd never thought to wonder about the compensations women'd been given in all the years they *weren't* equal, that as equality came to be a real thing, *weren't* then being dismantled, putting both women and men in impossible situations.  I learned that the very act of complaining about sorrow, fear, insecurity and loneliness was just itself, forbidden to a *manly* man--a *very* effective silencer of the entire male half of the species.  And I learned that, while my beliefs didn't change that the equality that feminism pursued *was* a good thing for men, feminism *alone* wasn't going to be enough, not to truly mete justice to men as a gender.  (Though I wasn't convinced that *those* MRAs were really the right answer as far as gender justice arbiters--see point 1!)\n\nSo--anybody else ever spend a lot of time with practitioners of a philosophy apparently opposed to your own, and learned a lot of valuable, self-growth sorts of things from it?  It doesn't have to be gender justice--it can be political, racial, spiritual, etc...share if you feel like it!","title":"Taking a Deep Dive into the Other Side, or That One Time I Spent Years Hanging Out Online with a Bunch of MRAs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/55a854\/taking_a_deep_dive_into_the_other_side_or_that\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

Your average MRA likely was a feminist at some point, has read some feminist literature, has spoken with many feminists, has watched some feminist lectures, and read at least a dozen feminist essays. S\/He has not gone to grad school for women's studies, does not have a job publishing feminism, and pays more attention to MRA speech then he does feminism speech. S\/He's a normal person with an interest in gender equality, some decent familiarity with feminism, but not profound commitment. That's the MRA I'm referring to here. That's responsible engagement but not as deep as what you'd get from a feminist professor.\n\nA large number of MRAs will boldly state that feminism is a bad thing, that feminism makes life harder for men, that feminism often fails to address men's issues, and that feminism is a barrier standing in the way of men's equality. When they say this, they'll usually populate it with examples. The \/r\/mensrights sidebar has threads explaining why feminism is not a friend to the MRM and how feminism has created barriers. When an MRA asserts this, he'll often receive the response that either not all feminists do that or even that most feminists oppose it. He'll likely disregard that and say that he does not care and that it is still feminism which is responsible.\n\nI think his point of view is very reasonable under a very large number of circumstances. There exist a lot of legislature, policy, and custom that's was made possible via feminism, whether or not feminists support it. For instance, **one** example is that men have to deal with the Duluth Model. That's just an indisputable fact and most MRAs believe it to be VERY harmful to men. It was also straight forwardly accepted via feminism. MRAs who try to say that run into an issue though. They get told:\n\n* Not all feminists believe in the Duluth Model.\n\n* Most feminists don't believe in the Duluth Model.\n\n* Here's a feminist theorist who wrote a paper against Duluth.\n\n* I'm a feminist and I don't support Duluth.\n\n* You think all feminists support Duluth?\n\nMy response is always the same: \"I don't care if only one feminist anywhere supported Duluth. Feminism brought us Duluth.\" There's a **key distinction** here between \"feminism\" and 'feminists\". Feminism is just the giant paradigm, the ideology, the cultural effects, the narrative, etc. It's not a person. It's only tenuously even an idea. It's an abstract metaphysical concept encapsulating a shit load of ideas. Without that metaphysical entity, we wouldn't have Duluth.\n\nI really don't care if some theorist somewhere wrote against Duluth. That doesn't benefit my situation at all. What I care about is equality and justice for men. I care about \"feminism\" and not \"feminists\" when I make this claim. That's why I don't engage with nuance of ideas of \"feminists.\" When those ideas get passed into legislature and Duluth, which again is just one example, gets overturned by feminists then I'll say \"feminism\" got rid of Duluth. Until then, you could present me 50,000 instances of dissent by \"feminists\" and it means nothing. It does nothing to help my situation.\n\nThe distinction between \"feminism\" and \"feminists\" is **vital** here. It's prime information that can't be overlooked. If an MRA says that \"feminism\" caused Duluth, he's saying absolutely nothing about \"feminists\". He's not painting \"feminists\" with a broad brush, or any brush at all. He's just identifying causal relevancy of a social movement or ideology and of the effects that men have to deal with as result. It's necessary for men's rights activism to work that we identify causes for men's struggles. We can't do that without addressing the abstract metaphysical entity of feminism and it's tangible effects. The fact that some authors or individuals don't like those affects doesn't change the situation for men and so we don't worry about it.","title":"Why so many MRAs oppose feminism, without considering NAFALT.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/3kq6hp\/why_so_many_mras_oppose_feminism_without\/","upvote_ratio":0.82,"over_18":false}

I believe, women\/feminists can have similar sentiment towards MRAs. \n\n This often leads to increasing hostility and generalizing, but lets wait a little bit with conclusions and try to think why this refusal to speak is happening.\n\n Men who want to discuss feminism are either \"allies\" or critical. Very critical. Feminists can either limit their communication to allies or just women. Or speak to men. If they agree to speak, they get all the accumulated hate for all the hostile\/combative ones that refused to speak.\n\n This creates a negative motivation. Women who hate men or long abandoned the idea of talking and coming to terms with them are out of reach of all the hostility. Moderate feminists that still want to give it a try - will receive all the ire.

It is indeed an important topic to discuss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first want to clarify one thing.\n\nRape of a male isn't always called \"rape\", in many places it it called \"made to penetrate assault (MTP)\" or \"forced to penetrate (FTP) assault\". It not always the case, but in many countries that is how the legal system defines it.\n\nWhy are they different? I have no idea. Should they be different? I see no reason for it really, but it is this way.\n\nThe page below has the definitions for both \"rape\" and \"MTP\"\/\"FTP\" as well as a few stats on both\n\n[https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/intimatepartnerviolence\/men-ipvsvandstalking.html](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/intimatepartnerviolence\/men-ipvsvandstalking.html)\n\nAs you can see, most instances of rape for male victims were by male perpetrators and most instances of MTP for male victims were by female perpetrators.\n\nWe can see from these numbers that more men experience MTP than rape, but for general unwanted sexual contact the numbers are more similar\n\nI wanted to bring up the different definitions because I sometimes see people say that when men are raped it is always or most often done by a male perpetrator. That is true for rape specifically, but as shown above it's not true for MTP assault or coercion. However, sometimes it does seem like something people think all or most sexual abuse done to male victims is by a male perpetrator. This is probably because many people think that rape includes MTP and don't realise the two are defined differently.\n\nThis is not a mistake I see made too often, but some people do make it. Sometimes people exclusively discuss one form of sexual assault (ex: rape, coercion, MTP, molestation). So if you are discussing this subject it may be good to distinguish between rape and MTP assault to avoid confusion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the above link is just one study, What about more?

However, there is still the need for a lot more research to be sure of the exact numbers. Some studies found equal number of male MTP and rape victims and female MTP and rape victims, most studies didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is also interesting that some of the studies (such as the 3rd and 4th studies) showed lifetime rates of MTP to be lower for men than the lifetime rates of rape for women, but then the rape rates in the 12 month prevalence time for women were very similar to the MTP rates for men. Why are the 12 month prevalence rates not lining up with the lifetime rates? There is inconsistency between studies but also within studies. Probably something to look into with future research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is limited data on coercion of any kind, whether it be coercion into sex or something else. Some of the studies above had info on it. Here is what else I could find:\n\n[https:\/\/www.apa.org\/news\/press\/releases\/2014\/03\/coerced-sex](https:\/\/www.apa.org\/news\/press\/releases\/2014\/03\/coerced-sex)\n\n[https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/12710831\/](https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/12710831\/)\n\n[https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/6474011\\_Predictors\\_of\\_Sexual\\_Coercion\\_Against\\_Women\\_and\\_Men\\_A\\_Multilevel\\_Multinational\\_Study\\_of\\_University\\_Students](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/6474011_Predictors_of_Sexual_Coercion_Against_Women_and_Men_A_Multilevel_Multinational_Study_of_University_Students)\n\n[https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/18299658\/Characteristics\\_of\\_male\\_and\\_female\\_victims\\_of\\_sexual\\_pressure](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/18299658\/Characteristics_of_male_and_female_victims_of_sexual_pressure)\n\nA lot of data shows coercion for men being significantly lower than for women. Some other data shows the levels being more similar. Again, more research needs to be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many misconceptions female victims of sexual assault face, \"Rape Myths\" is a term for these misconceptions. These include what the victim wore, if they were drunk, they secretly liked it and more.\n\nMale victims also face misconceptions, they aren't all the same as what female victims face. For example male victims, to my knowledge, are not asked what they wore. However other things like if they were drunk or secretly liked it are experienced by both male and female victims. The idea of male victims enjoying the assault may be more commonly said to male victims than female ones, or at least some people say that. I'm not 100% sure that's true, it might be, it might be equal.\n\nMen and women experience the same amount of trauma from an assault. Being drunk is never an excuse to assault someone. Being hard is not the same as consenting.\n\nAnalysis of some of the myths:\n\n[https:\/\/terratalk.medium.com\/an-erection-is-not-consent-ad2fc9c11346](https:\/\/terratalk.medium.com\/an-erection-is-not-consent-ad2fc9c11346)\n\n[https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/17111328\/Male\\_Rape\\_Myths\\_Understanding\\_and\\_Explaining\\_Social\\_Attitudes\\_Surrounding\\_Male\\_Rape](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/17111328\/Male_Rape_Myths_Understanding_and_Explaining_Social_Attitudes_Surrounding_Male_Rape)\n\n[https:\/\/sci-hub.hkvisa.net\/10.1002\/casr.30310](https:\/\/sci-hub.hkvisa.net\/10.1002\/casr.30310)\n\nSadly both male and female victims face these misconceptions to this day. I think it will probably take a long time for these myths to be fully or mostly eradicated.\n\nAdditionally, due to these misconceptions, male victims of sexual assault don't always receive support:\n\n[https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/18578370\/College\\_Students\\_Beliefs\\_Regarding\\_Help\\_Seeking\\_for\\_Male\\_and\\_Female\\_Sexual\\_Assault\\_Survivors\\_Even\\_Less\\_Support\\_for\\_Male\\_Survivors](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/18578370\/College_Students_Beliefs_Regarding_Help_Seeking_for_Male_and_Female_Sexual_Assault_Survivors_Even_Less_Support_for_Male_Survivors)\n\n[https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/34504468\/Forgotten\\_victims\\_students\\_attitudes\\_towards\\_and\\_responses\\_to\\_male\\_sexual\\_victimisation](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/34504468\/Forgotten_victims_students_attitudes_towards_and_responses_to_male_sexual_victimisation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy final point is that there is a lack of research on why perpetrators of sexual assault do it. There is limited research on male perpetrators:\n\n[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/10\/30\/health\/men-rape-sexual-assault.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/10\/30\/health\/men-rape-sexual-assault.html)\n\n[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3139770\/](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3139770\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even less I could find on female perpetrators:\n\n[https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/50089264\/Female\\_perpetrators\\_of\\_rape\\_with\\_particular\\_cruelty](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/50089264\/Female_perpetrators_of_rape_with_particular_cruelty)\n\nI like how this study is done, the analyses are good. However, the low of a sample size does limit it a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in all, male victims of sexual assault are significantly more common than most people probably think. However, again as was the case with other posts I made on domestic violence and paedophilia, more research needs to be done. We need to get a better idea of how sexual assault affects men, by finding the true number whatever it is, if its at the same rate as women doesn't matter, it happens too often regardless. Other things to do are figuring out perpetrator motivations for both male and female perpetrators, and eradicating the misconceptions. Not only must those things be done, but the future research needs to be accepted as well. Too often are male victims ignored and regardless of how often it happens, researching and helping needs to be accepted.\n\n\nRecourses for help.

Politically I'm pretty centrist\/liberal and not much of a progressive or conservative, but it was clear to me at the time that AOC would come out looking like the bigger person. \n\nBut now, AOC and Pelosi seem to be describing it as an \"attack on women\" and \"abuse\"; and AOC is being lauded as a victim of sexism. I find this interesting--in part because I've never seen \"bitch\" as any more sexist than \"asshole,\" \"douchebag,\" or the plethora of other insults that are primarily lobbed at one gender. If anything, \"bitch\" is used toward both men and women, albeit with different meanings and contexts. But most importantly, I am surprised to continue seeing so many women's rights advocates and feminists treat insults directed at men and women very, very differently.\n\nThe question of \"why are men and women held to different standards\" has been discussed ad nauseum, both on this sub and elsewhere. But what fascinates me is how differently men and women are treated when they are *targets* of insults or personal attacks. I.e. society at large takes way more offense when someone, especially a man, lobs insults at a woman. Whereas if some random female congressperson called AOC a \"fucking bitch,\" it wouldn't have had as much staying power as a story.\n\nSo why do you think that is? Now that more and more women are being elected into office, will the \"male=abuser, woman=target\" mentality disappear with other gender roles? I've always seen the over-protection and dependence of women as a leftover gender role that's existed for centuries, but I'm curious as to other thoughts. Will this mentality be something that erodes over time as gender roles erode? Or will mainstream feminists continue using this gender role to the advantage of women wherever possible, supporting what seems to be a traditionalist and paternalistic difference in treatment between the sexes?","title":"The AOC\/Ted Yoho controversy and how we view insults toward men versus women","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/hwjneo\/the_aocted_yoho_controversy_and_how_we_view\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

While I do think that he says a couple of things that I take issue with, for the most part I think it's a pretty sensible and even-handed response.\n\nHowever, there's been a little backlash regarding some of what he said. Lexi Alexander (a director in Hollywood) said something along the lines of him running for the GOP based on what he said, but most importantly I think Damon attempted to say that it's a spectrum of behavior, and that rape and harassment aren't the same thing. What I believe caused such a response was him saying that there are behaviors that are criminal, and behaviors that are just unacceptable and gross, and that we shouldn't lump them together in the same category.\n\nPersonally I stay away from looking to celebrity opinions on political and social issues as they usually have little to nothing to offer to any real discussion about important issues, but this kind of struck me. What he was saying seemed pretty sensible to me, and it seems like he was guilty of adding perhaps a bit a nuance (and I find it sad that \"nuanced\" now means simply differentiating between observably different types of behavior) and restraint to lumping everyone together. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this? Was he egregiously wrong in any way that warrants such an outcry? If so, why? If not, what does the backlash say about us?

I have a girlfriend whom I love very much (along with her family), two brothers, and I could count my friends on one hand.\n\nMy friend (S), my girlfriend, my brother's girlfriend and I were headed to a party. I don't really like parties, but I hadn't seen S in a long time, so I was happy to be going.\n\nS is a feminist, and she's always been open about it. I've never really debated anything with her, because that's not what we're about. We're two friendly people who make each other happy, and I've never seen a need to complicate that.\n\nOn the way to the party, I was beginning to tell a story about my other friend, B. \"My friend B, do you remember B?\" I asked S. She nonchalantly replied \"oh yeah, I hate him\".\n\nInternally, I was stunned. I could never have imagined her saying she hated anyone before last night. I asked her why.\n\n\"I met him one time, and in the first 15 minutes he mentioned that he was an MRA. And like, I know he was 'just kidding', but still...\"\n\nFor context: about a month ago, B and I were walking from class to class together when I saw S, so we went over and hung out with her for a little. At the time, there had been a security bulletin posted about an attempted assault. I jokingly asked what an attempted assault looks like. B said \"the tiny men's rights activist in my head suspects that someone just said hi to a woman and they freaked out, but that's probably not what happened\".\n\nThat was the whole exchange. At least, the whole part relating to B being an MRA. He'd certainly never mentioned it to me, nor have I ever heard him say anything negative about women. In fact, he's one of the guys I can chew the fat with about how sexist one of our classmates is.\n\nAt this point, it's worth noting that I've never known S to be one of \"those\" feminists. In my mind, she's always been the example of the kind of feminist I could support. One time she made a joke about neckbeards\/fedoras, but I told her I was probably the wrong audience for it, and she had no problem with that.\n\nWe stopped talking about it, and arrived at the party. The music was loud enough that we couldn't talk to each other. Normally, that drives me nuts, because I don't dance, but this time I was a little relieved. My eardrums were throbbing, but I didn't want to bring this up with S, and it could be difficult not to.\n\nI just wanted to share this story with the feminists here. This is not meant to be a sick burn on your movement, nor is it me complaining about how mean feminists are.\n\nI wanted to share this because I want you to understand what it's like to be feminism-critical. It may seem like we spend most of our time online, high-fiving each other over how reasonable we are. We may look like we play gender politics like a game, trying to outlogic people who are discussing issues which actually affect them. Maybe we just seem contrarian, arguing whatever it is which is closest to people's identities.\n\nBut being feminism-critical doesn't look like that to me. To me, it looks like choosing between hiding your opinions from your friends and losing them. It means being a political minority in every room you walk into, and not the kind people debate with, the kind they ostracise. But most of all, it means knowing that there exists a massive and powerful movement which will lead the kindest, gentlest and most empathic people you know to casually and proudly proclaim their hatred for other human beings. It means living in a world where you know there are legitimate targets, but if you mention it, you become one.\n\nI haven't yet told S that I'm critical of the feminist movement, and I don't know if I can. What I do know is that B didn't say anything I wouldn't have. I do have a tiny MRA in my head, everyone who's ever been wronged by the feminist movement does. So if what S says is true, she hates me, even if she doesn't know it. Am I lying to her by not telling her? Like I said, I can count my friends on one hand, and I'd rather not have them hate me. At the same time, if they do hate me, they have a right to know that they hate me.

Only 2 programs had over 70% men. \n * Marianne Anden\u00e6s, Leader of the students' parliament said the following: \"In many so-called *elite* study programs, we see women being a majority. This could be due to a structural difference in high school grading. Using 'study points' (affirmative action) could help alleviate this inequality.\"\n * Despite using affirmative action to help women get into male-dominated study programs, the universities do not feel affirmative action is a good solution to this problem, and will not be implementing it in the near future.\n\nThere seems to be an attitude against affirmative action in general, and a lot of politicians claim it's a bad solution, despite it's apparent effectiveness in helping women in male dominated programs. However, there is no move to remove affirmative action helping women, only to stop it being used for men as well.\n\nThis is all in spite of Norway being number 5 on the global gender inequality index, which i suspect only measure inequality as women being behind men.\n\nOne also has to keep in mind that there's a certain momentum to gender balance which starts in school and it's effects will only be apparent in workplace and leadership statistics many years down the road, when it will be to late to significantly influence the gap.\n\nAny thoughts?","title":"Norway: Despite women's overwhelming numbers in higher education, affirmative action is mostly being used to help out females, not males.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2y4jl0\/norway_despite_womens_overwhelming_numbers_in\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

I can avoid spending time with colleagues who mistrust\nme because of my politics.\n2. If I apply for a job, I can be confident my political\nviews are more likely to be an asset than liability.\n3. I can be confident that the political beliefs I hold and\nthe political candidates I support will not be routinely\nmocked by my colleagues.\n4. I can be pretty confident that, if I present results at\ncolloquia and conferences that validate my political\nviews, I will not be mocked or insulted by my colleagues.\n5. I can be pretty sure that my students who share my\npolitical views and go on to academic jobs will be\nable to focus on being competent teachers and scientists\nand will not have to worry about hiding their\npolitics from senior faculty.\n6. I can paint caricature-like pictures based on the most\nextreme and irrational beliefs of those who differ\nfrom me ideologically without feeling any penalty\nfor doing so.\n7. I can criticize colleagues\u2019 research that differs from\nmine on issues such as race, sex, or politics without\nfear of being accused of being an authoritarian, racist,\nor sexist.\n8. I can systematically misinterpret, misrepresent, or\nignore research in such a manner as to sustain my\npolitical views and be confident that such misinterpretations,\nmisrepresentations, or oversights are\nunlikely to be recognized by my colleagues.\n9. If I work in politically charged areas, such as race,\ngender, class, and politics and if my papers, grants,\nor symposia are rejected, I need not ask each time if\npolitical bias led to the rejection.\n10. I will feel welcomed and \u201cnormal\u201d in the usual walks\nof my academic life.\n11. I will not have to worry whether citations to and\nimpact of my scholarship will be artificially diluted\nbecause most of my colleagues do not like its political\nimplications.\n12. I do not have to worry that reviewers and editors\nwill require a higher standard to publish or fund my\nresearch than they require to publish or fund research\nwith implications for the opposite ideology.\n13. In order to publish my research demonstrating moral\nfailures or cognitive biases among those with different\nideological beliefs than mine, I will not need to\nconsider camouflaging my results or sugar coating\nthe conclusions to avoid offending the political sensitivities\nof reviewers.\n14.

One of the hypothetical scenarios was to \"*use it as an opportunity to further understand men's violence against women by gathering data solely on men's experience of IPV as a perpetrator.*\" \n\nIn 2005, the findings were published from the WHO *Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence Against Women* [1]. Despite being aware of the significant amount of female perpetrated IPV against men and being requested to include questions about men's victimisation in the study from researchers like Murray Straus, they refused (emphasis mine).\n\n> The results showing the predominance of bidirectional violence even in traditionally male-dominant societies may seem implausible to many readers. However, they are consistent with results from the ongoing Global School-based Health Survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) among students 13 to 15 years old. The students were asked if they had been hit, slapped or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend in the past 12 months. Results for the first few countries show 15% of girls and 29% of boys in Jordan responded \"yes\", as did 9% of girls and 16% of boys in Namibia, 6% of girls and 8% of boys in Swaziland, and 18% of girls and 23% of boys in Zambia. In all five countries, more girls hit partners than boys. Perhaps the results from both the International Dating Violence Study and the WHO school study occurred because both studies are of dating relationships. The WHO could have answered that question in another survey it conducted of married and cohabiting violence, but *the organizers of that study followed the usual practice of restricting the study to the victimization of women and refused requests to include questions on perpetration by the women in the study*. [2 pp 268]\n\nEven though they didn't include male victims in the quantitative part of the study, the steering committee acknowledged that men's victimisation needs to be included in future research.\n\n> The original plan for the WHO Study included interviews with a subpopulation of men about their experiences and perpetration of violence, including partner violence. This would have allowed researchers to compare men\u2019s and women\u2019s accounts of violence in intimate relationships and would have yielded data to investigate the extent to which men are physically or sexually abused by their female partners. On the advice of the Study Steering Committee, it was decided to include men only in the qualitative, formative component of the study and not in the quantitative survey.\n>\n> This decision was taken for two reasons. First, it was considered unsafe to interview men and women in the same household, because this could have potentially put a woman at risk of future violence by alerting her partner to the nature of the questions. Second, to carry out an equivalent number of interviews in separate households was deemed too expensive.\n> \n> Nevertheless, it is recognized that men\u2019s experiences of partner violence, as well as the reasons why men perpetrate violence against women, need to be explored in future research. Extreme caution should be used in any study of partner violence that seeks to compile prevalence data on men as well as women at the same time because of the potential safety implications. [1 pp 7]\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, the *International Center for Research on Women* (ICRW) and pro-femuinist NGO *Instituto Promundo* conducted a multi-country study into men and men's experiences of IPV, the *International Men and Gender Equality Survey* (IMAGES). The questionnaire was developed by Rachel Jewkes (who was co-chair of the WHO Multi-Country Study Steering Committee) and had significant input from Mary Ellsberg (one of the principal researchers of the WHO Multi-Country Study and Research Director for the ICRW) [3 pp 2].\n\nThe IMAGES questionnaire was based on a survey conducted by the Nordic Gender Institute on gender equality.\n\n> Many items on the IMAGES questionnaire have been influenced by a survey designed for the 2005 \"Gender Equality and Quality of Life study in Norway, carried out by the Nordic Gender Institute (NIKK) and the Work Research Institute (WRI) and financed by the Norwegian Ministry of Children and Equality.^10 A second study on men, health and violence, carried out in 2008-2009 by the Medical Research Council of South Africa, used many but not all items from the IMAGES questionnaire and added many items for the IMAGES questionnaire.^11 Brief overviews of both of these studies can be found in Annex I. [3 pp 13]\n\nSome of the IPV findings from the NIKK survey are:\n\n> In the next question, the respondents were asked to what extent they and\/or their partner have been angry or furious in order to exert pressure. The diagram below shows the distribution of answers between the sexes.\n> \n> The numbers indicate that \u201cbeing angry or furious\u201d is a strategy used by both men and women, but that women report having done it themselves slightly more often than men.\n> \n> In the next question, the respondents were asked to what extent they and\/or their partner have used threats of violence in order to exert pressure. The diagram below shows the distribution of answers between the sexes. For men, there is hardly any significant difference between those describing their present and those describing their earlier relationships. For women, there are some significant differences.\n>  \n> Around 96 per cent of both men and women have chosen the alternative \u201cneither has done it\u201d. [4 pp 63-64]\n\nAnd:\n\n> In the last question of this set, the respondents were asked to what extent they and\/or their partner have used violence in order to exert pressure. The diagram below shows the distribution of answers between the sexes.\n> \n> Here, too, the numbers are low. We see, however, that their own reported use of violence is more or less the same among women and men. There is also a relatively good correlation between the pictures the partners provide of each other\u2019s violence. Around 96 per cent of both men and women have, here too, chosen the alternative \u201cneither has done it\u201d. [4 pp 65-66]\n\nLike may other surveys, the NIKK study finds statistically similar rates of perpetration in the previous 12 months and that women report exposure to IPV in past relationships more than men do. Women report being exposed to more sever IPV than men but the NKK study doesn't provide any statistics on this difference.\n\nThe IMAGES study interviewed 8,000 men and 3,500 women aged 18-59 in six countries (Brazil, Chile, Croatia, India, Mexico and Rwanda) and included questions about the victimisation and perpetration of IPV.\n\n> *Relationship, gender-based violence and transactional sex*. Use of violence (physical, sexual, psychological) against partner (using WHO protocol); victimization of violence by partner (using WHO protocol); men\u2019s use of sexual violence against non-partners; men\u2019s self-reported purchasing of sex or paying for sex, including with underage individuals. [3 pp 15]\n\nSo given the need for a multi-country study to look at the prevalence of men's victimisation, that the survey instrument was developed by a member of the WHO study steering committee that made the recommendation that men's victimisation be included in future research, that the research director of the funder the IMAGES study was also a lead researcher in the WHO study, and the study was based on the methodology of a study that looked at both men's and women's victimisation, what is the prevalence of men's IPV victimisation? \n\nWell, we simply just don't know, they didn't even bother to ask. The men's questionnaire only asks about their perpetration of IPV and the women's questionnaire only asks about their victimisation. Seriously.\n\nAnd they didn't ask in the *next* multi-country study either.\n\n*United Nations Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific* (who's lead technical researcher was Rachel Jewkes) just replicated the IMAGES survey in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea [6].\n\nWhy do they ignore men as victims of IPV (emphasis mine)?\n\n> While gender inequality, power and violent forms of masculinity may be understood as the root causes of violence against women, current understanding of violence against women also suggests that women\u2019s experiences and men\u2019s perpetration of violence are associated with a complex array of individual, household, community and societal level factors. *The socio-ecological model is a commonly used conceptual framework that maps the factors associated with women\u2019s and men\u2019s experiences of violence across the different levels of society*, as represented in figure 1.1 (O\u2019Toole, Schiffman and Edwards, 2007; Gage, 2005; United Nations General Assembly, 2006; *Heise, 1998*; WHO and \nLSHTM, 2010).\n> \n> Given that this is an epidemiological study conducted with individual men and women, the findings provide evidence of the individual- and family-level factors that are correlated with men\u2019s use of violence against women (presented in Chapters 6 and 7). *Informed by feminist theory, the first premise of this analysis is that these individual- and family-level factors exist within, and are formed by, broader community norms and social environments of patriarchy and gender inequality, which is also borne out by the data*, as discussed in Chapter 8. [6 pp 13]\n\nSimply put, it is a *feminist* study that uses Lori Heise's *Integrated Ecological Framework* (the feminist framework for IPV that is *the most cited in the literature*).\n\nAnd it is a problem going forward too, I have it from a reliable source that the IMAGES \/ UN Multi-Country Men's Study framework is being integrated into the [Demographic and Health Surveys](http:\/\/dhsprogram.com\/) (DHS) domestic violence module in pretty much the same way the WHO Multi-Country Women's Study was. The DHS Program has collected, analyzed, and disseminated accurate and representative data on population, health, HIV, and nutrition through more than 300 surveys in over 90 countries.\n\nThis is what institutional feminism looks like, and they just don't care about IPV perpetrated against men by women *at all*.\n\n1.

Nevertheless, I'm curious the hear if people agree\/disagree, or can perhaps suggest other shows that treat masculinity or femininity in similar ways?\n\nIt seems to me that the television show King of the Hill is one of the best deconstructions of masculinity that has been on TV.\n\nThe main character is Hank Hill. To some, he is a paragon of masculinity. He's great at sports, he has a wife and family, straightforward and honest, will threaten physical violence against those he feels deserve it, he lives for lawn work and performs his job effectively and with zeal. However, Hank's masculinity causes him problems. He's not unhappy, per se, but he is limited. He has a narrow urethra so he has trouble conceiving. His straightforward, honest and responsible personality leads him to be manipulated by shadier characters. His social mores are constantly tested, which he often reacts to with fear. Luckily, his inherent decency allows him to grow as a person when tested.\n\nOne of the central conflicts his masculinity causes is with his son, Bobby. Bobby isn't really masculine at all. He's bad at sports, he's pudgy and weak, he escapes sticky situations with humor instead of force and constantly acts in ways Hank finds unmanly and bizarre, leading him to often remark \"That boy ain't right.\" However, when there is a clash between them, their inherent goodness and bonds lead them to understand and accept each other. Bobby Hill, who is what is he and doesn't allow others to define him, is happy because of this. He demonstrates how a strict adherence to masculinity is not necessary to live a good life.\n\nHank's problems stem from his father, Cotton, who I think represents toxic masculinity. To most of the world he's reached the highest summits of manhood. He's a war hero, he has a busty wife, his virility is so great he got her pregnant despite his age, and commands a great deal of respect. To those who know him, he is loud, boorish, misogynistic, and an overall terrible person. Hank is constantly berated for not living up to Cotton's idea of masculinity, he is the source of Hank's reluctance to go outside of his gender roles.\n\nHis neighbors also represent broken masculinity. Boomhauer sleeps with many ladies, but Bobby rejects his shallow view of relationships. Dale leads a perfect masculine life, with an attractive wife, a son he loves, and a job that involves killing. However, he's only happy because of his rejection of reality. His wife cheats on him constantly, and his son is obviously not even his. Bill is a masculine ideal fallen. He used to be a sports legend, but now he is a pathetic divorcee who no one respects. He shows that masculine status is fragile, and the lack of support for such fallen men. Kahn is obsessed with status, feeling the need to pretend that he is far more successful than he actually is. His entire self worth revolves around his accomplishments.\n\nOverall, I think it communicates an even-handed account of masculinity and the problems it can cause. It doesn't suggest that masculinity can't be a good, powerful force, but it can be a cage that can keep men from leading the best life possible.\n\nIt's also a great TV show, so I recommend checking it out if you haven't and feel so inclined.","title":"King of the Hill and Masculinity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2fn8q0\/king_of_the_hill_and_masculinity\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

And I remember being in high school and realizing that, yeah, there's basically no way to be more unattractive to women. Quoting the piece:\n\n>\"Most women pledge allegiance to this idea that women can explore their emotions, break down, fall apart\u2014and it's healthy,\" Brown said. \"But guys are not allowed to fall apart.\" Ironically, she explained, men are often pressured to open up and talk about their feelings, and they are criticized for being emotionally walled-off; but if they get too real, they are met with revulsion.

I suggested that it may not be a great idea since men put a very big premium on natural boobs, especially if they're naturally very large. Her being an escort, that matters a lot. She disagreed. We had a very long drawn out debate on the matter and it turns out she was right. We're gonna wait until after we have kids, but apparently that's gonna be the best business decision she's ever made because men are much more into fake boobs than I would have thought. \n\n-\n\nIn this discussion about male sexuality, being a male turns out to have given me zero actual expertise. Men are generally into boob jobs and bbls, and anyone saying otherwise has not done extensive research into the matter. Looking back on this discussion, I think I was perhaps viewing men with rose-tinted glasses. I'm shooting from the hip  here, but I'd bet that more women than men know that men are into things like boob jobs and bbls because plastic surgery is a big business. My new revised opinion is that the people who have to attract straight men know more about what straight men are attracted to than straight men do. \n\n-\n\nI had a similar experience when I started taking steroids. I hear such an insane amount of women tell me about how they aren't into muscles. I started seriously trying to date once I got my squat up from untrained to 405 lbs for 5 reps. I was suddenly much more dateable. When  I met my wife, she cautioned me against getting too muscular. I had a view of what I wanted my body to look like and asked her to trust me. She was hesitant. She only really gave me the enthusiastic green light to get my squat up to six plates after my I brought her to a serious powerlifting gym and she saw what muscle looks like. \n\n-\n\nSo now let's get to the point...\n\n-\n\nMen, especially men in places like where I grew up in the North East, are really sold an image of what women want them to be. Many men who internalize these modern descriptions of what a man should be like and then grow up to be incels. When I make a claim that it's because the image boys are sold is not what women are attracted to and that we've developmentally stunted boys into growing up unfuckable, I have to debate theory. Women will  say things like, \"Why would I want to be with a man who's  like _________?\" And unfortunately, there just isn't a culturally backed and institutionalized perspective for me to draw from and so I'm left with the basic assumption that the woman I'm speaking to has some authority on the topic. \n\n-\n\nAt the end of the day, men and women glamorize our  own sexualities. It's kind of ugly to tell a woman, especially one who takes pride in  the size of her natural  boobs, that they'd be improved by being stuffed with silicone. It's kind of ugly to tell a man that his ideal body requires an amount of lean body mass that might not even be naturally possible. For that reason, people often go into denial about this shit and give false views as to what they're attracted to. Moreover, I've never had to  attract a man before so if my advice  sucks then I never suffer. I just look virtuous for having the right view on fake boobs. Same goes for women who give bad advice. They don't have to be incels.\n\n-\n\nIt's a lot easier to go to someone of your own gender and ask them to reveal the dirty secrets of the other gender. This has extra salience though, because our idea of the perfect man is very ideological. There is a lot of academic theory that dissects, deconstructs, and criticizes masculinity and that denies that certain male behaviors are attractive even when we all know men who exhibit them and are great with women. Because this theory is considered to be \"Good values\" in America, we showcase it in children's television and enforce it in schools. We pat girls on the head for saying they're into it and we pat boys on  the head for saying they want to become it. And then later on in life, we call those men incels and mark them as terrorists.","title":"It's usually taken for granted that women are good people to ask about what women are attracted to, I think we should begin to question that.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/yb8gi7\/its_usually_taken_for_granted_that_women_are_good\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

But intersectional thinkers ought to also recognize a gender component to the murder: as a black boy, Till was vulnerable to accusations of impropriety from a white woman in a way that black girls were not.\n\nIntersectional feminist literature, however, routinely fails to recognize this basic point. [Feminist books aimed at young adults](https:\/\/dc.etsu.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=4844&context=etd) portray Bryant as sharing in Till's victimhood at the hands of her husband, and a grad school author analyzing the books unironically uses this false accusation to highlight women's sexual victimization. Others focus on Till's [polio-induced speech disability](https:\/\/www.talilalewis.com\/blog\/emmett-till-disability-erasure) which may have been mistaken by Bryant for a sexual wolf-whistle; but do not interrogate how our society punishes harmless expressions of male sexuality. Masculinists (that is, feminists who study masculinity) almost get it, observing \"[the trope of protecting White womanhood](https:\/\/scholarship.law.bu.edu\/faculty_scholarship\/2863\/)\" (scare-capitalization?) at trial. Unfortunately they segue into discussing \"masculine anxiety for White men\", rather than the victim's masculinity. Rebuffing Susan Brownmiller's attempt to paint 14-year old Till as a masculine menace, intersectional feminist Angela Davis also [emphasizes the racial component of Till's murder](https:\/\/isreview.org\/issue\/91\/black-feminism-and-intersectionality\/index.html):\n\n>In choosing to take sides with white women, regardless of the circumstances, Brownmiller herself capitulates to racism. Her failure to alert white women about the urgency of combining a fierce challenge to racism with the necessary battle against sexism is an important plus for the forces of racism today.\n\nThese scholars aren't wrong, but perhaps as a direct result of their feminist lens, they overlook the obvious fact that Till was killed for his gender as well as his race. Do intersectional thinkers have a blind spot when it comes to male victims? Given that Till's murder is placed in the context of women's sexual victimization, disability issues, and white male anxiety, is it also appropriate or enlightening to place it in the context of false accusations and male victimization? Or does the oppression of blacks in the Jim Crow south, and\/or their continued oppression\/disadvantage in the justice system, make a racial lens uniquely appropriate for looking at Till's murder? And should Bryant be prosecuted for her role in Till's kidnapping and murder?","title":"Arrest warrant for woman who accused Emmett Till found nearly 70 years later in court basement","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/voaoy5\/arrest_warrant_for_woman_who_accused_emmett_till\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

We have an industry of articles written not to pursue the truth of the matter but to cover the juiciest drama possible. Actually, if they were just in it for clicks, there would be that same flurry of articles about the lawsuit and instead there is not much.\n\nOf course perhaps it\u2019s politics as Avellone has an adamant stance that it is possible to write narratives that don\u2019t involve politics in games whereas many people in the industry are advocating for more modern politics being put into writing. There is additional motivations to get him out of the industry to some within it.\n\nRegardless, I feel like the truth of accusations is mostly irrelevant. All that matters is the agenda or agendas behind the accusation and that is a travesty of justice. \n\nQuestions for discussion:\n\n1: What do you think about the punishments for accused people happening outside of a courtroom and instead in the court of public opinion?\n\n2: Does Avellone have a libel case? Against what entities?\n\n3: What is the media\u2019s role in false accusations of public figures?

I have no idea if people will be interested. I've also linked a couple of studies here in the past that will be included as part of this essay. A few points before we begin:\n\n1. I by no means claim a monopoly on truth, I am just going from my understanding and personal perspectives.\n2. I am not, and will ever be a proponent of stereotyping *any* individual. These are a reflection of the potential differences based off of biological influences. They are **not** absolute but statistical averages and may in fact be due to socialisation, but I am of the opinion that this is too narrow to apply on an epistemological level. I will explore this later in the post.\n3. I think discrimination definitely exists and we should be mindful to call it out when it happens *but* discrepencies in outcomes may have other factors that are more significant than mere discrimination and I am not convinced you can use these to measure discrimination at face value. In fact, I believe it is potentially dangerous.\n4. Socialisation definitely has an impact, but this doesn't mean that biology doesn't and that's why I am focusing on this today. I think nurture can interrupt or counteract biology but I don't think this is an absolute and I think every individual is different as to what nurture cues they will react to positively or negatively.\n5. I hope that people can be respectful but I know these discussions can sometimes get heated. So you do you!\n6. Let's begin...\n\n# The Great Nature vs Nurture Debate:\n\nSo many people who have followed this topic may be aware of this study by [Gijsbert Stoet and David C. Geary](https:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/db85\/143e577e48f8abe57af7c2579edd40b4fa23.pdf?_ga=2.126522381.1271067312.1581592914-181253211.1581592914), which seemingly measured how women in STEM decreased in countries with more gender equality. This is despite the fact that:\n\n>Using an international database on adolescent achievement in science, mathematics, and reading (N = 472,242), we showed that girls performed similarly to or better than boys in science in two of every three countries, and in nearly all countries, more girls appeared capable of college-level STEM study than had enrolled.\n\nThe conclusions were as follows:\n\n>One of the main findings of this study is that, paradoxically, countries with lower levels of gender equality had relatively more women among STEM graduates than did more gender-equal countries. This is a paradox, because gender-equal countries are those that give girls and women more educational and empowerment opportunities and that generally promote girls\u2019 and women\u2019s engagement in STEM fields\n\nThis has recently been come under [notable critique](https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2020\/02\/women-stem-innate-disinterest-debunked.amp?__twitter_impression=true) and subsequent defense of the study by the original [authors](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/339192585_The_Gender-Equality_Paradox_Is_Part_of_a_Bigger_Phenomenon_Reply_to_Richardson_and_Colleagues_2020\/link\/5e497af9a6fdccd965ac31d6\/download):\n\n>**Critique**  \n>  \n>The case of Algeria highlights a central point of contention. In Algeria, 53 percent of STEM graduates are women. Still, only 9 percent of women college graduates choose a degree in STEM, compared with 13 percent of men. Stoet and Geary had claimed that they were reporting the 53 percent number, but they were actually focusing on the statistic that men were receiving degrees in STEM at a higher rate.  \n>  \n>In their revised paper, Stoet and Geary maintain that there is a gender paradox in STEM but clarify that it relates to their more obscure measure, which they termed the \u201cpropensity\u201d of women and men to attain a higher degree in STEM.  \n>  \n>**Response**  \n>  \n>We agree that there are different ways to express the proportion of women who choose STEM degrees. In our view, it is important to control for differences in the overall number of women and men who attend college, which varies from nation to nation. Accordingly, in our original article (Stoet & Geary, 2018), we chose a calculation method that adjusts for this potential confound.  \n>  \n>Algeria provides a good example of such a confound, where 53% of all STEM graduates are women. At face value, Algeria has established gender parity in STEM graduates. However, the absolute percentage does not tell us about the sex difference in the propensity to pursue STEM when we consider that 62.7% of all Algerian college students are women (Richardson et\u00a0al., 2020). Of all Algerian women graduating from college, 8.9% pursued a degree in a STEM field, compared with 13.0% of men. Thus, absolute parity is achieved only because there are many more women than men in college. We are interested in the propensity of women and men to choose STEM and therefore use a calculation that provides the percentage of women among STEM graduates when the total numbers of women and men in college would be equal (8.9\/(8.9 + 13) \u00d7 100 = 41%).  \n>  \n>That said, our specific approach has no bearing on the conclusions. Even taking the absolute percentage of women STEM graduates among all STEM graduates (e.g., 53% in Algeria), we still find the same negative correlation between women in STEM and the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI; rs = \u2013.42, p = .002 compared with rs = \u2013.47, p < .001 in Stoet & Geary, 2018, p.\u00a0587)\n\nThe next critique is based off of the fact that Stoet and Geary have recently created a new metric for potentially measuring gender inequality (BIGI), introducing areas where men might fall behind women but aren't included as part of other scales (Global Gender Gap Index, GGGI)  using new metrics that they consider relevant to all men and women in any society:\n\n1. Healthy Life Expectancy (years expected to live in good health)\n2. Basic education (literacy, and years of primary, and secondary education)\n3. Life satisfaction\n\nSo the critique is as follows:\n\n>**Critique**  \n>  \n>In any case, all nation-level gender equality measures are highly imperfect for understanding the drivers of gender equality.\u00a0Stoet and Geary naively adopt the GGGI as a social science measure of gender equality, but it was not designed for that purpose, and it should not be used as a measure of gender empowerment or attitudes about gender.\u00a0For example, Rwanda ranked sixth in the world on the 2015 GGGI due to high representation of women in economic and political life. This outstanding representation stemmed from Rwanda\u2019s post-genocide sex ratio imbalance, not a campaign to increase women\u2019s empowerment. Similarly, a negative correlation between STEM degrees and GGGI rank in a particular country\u2014say, Luxembourg\u2014tells us nothing about whether gender equality is causally related to STEM achievement or a product of other factors such as coeducational opportunities on offer for higher education in STEM in that locality.  \n>  \n>**Response**  \n>  \n>Further, we agree with Richardson and colleagues that our recently published Basic Index of Gender Inequality (BIGI; Stoet & Geary, 2019) does not correlate with the STEM graduation gap (unlike the GGGI). The BIGI provides a simplified measure of sex differences in well-being but does not focus on women\u2019s empowerment (e.g., participation in politics or the labor force). We believe that there is no theoretical reason to expect a relation between BIGI scores and the propensity of women to pursue STEM degrees...  \n>  \n>With respect to the issue of how much an international indicator such as the GGGI can tell us about sex differences, we note that the GGGI is frequently used in the psychological and social sciences and that it is the only annually reported independent gender-gap index\n\nThis is all very much a back and forth, and by itself doesn't tell us anything. There is one more critique, not included in the document I sourced but I found it too interesting to exclude (as part of a debate on reddit):\n\n>In developing countries, entering a STEM field is far more lucrative for a woman than for a woman in the developed world. Perhaps as gender equality increases, non-STEM fields become more of a viable option for women, so it is not necessarily based on preferences, but rather on economic incentive.\n\nTo which I replied:\n\n>But the removal of economic incentive could give women more freedom to decide their futures based on their preferences? So when other fields become more viable, they choose to go into the fields most suited to their preferences? I just don't think your point inherently contradicts the points others have made.\n\nAnd will also raise the final point by Stoet and Geary in their defense:\n\n>Moreover, the gender-equality paradox is consistent with a much broader literature, in which sex differences for many traits are larger in more egalitarian countries.\n\nSo why is this argument happening? And what does the broader literature say. What is the limit of this broader literature? I'll attempt to explore all of this. Stay tuned.\n\n# The Broader Literature (and the Limits)\n\nSo what is this literature, there's certainly some referenced in the response but I would be more inclined to include my own at this point. I haven't checked if there's any overlap with the literature in the document and this is going to be more of a source dump so consider yourself warned. I'm trying to stay within the character limit afterall...\n\n**BRAAAIIINS:**\n\nSo let's start with the biological studies. Do men and women have different brains on average and what could this mean? Well, there's a few studies that say no:\n\nFor instance, [Joel et al](https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/112\/50\/15468.abstract) came to this conclusion:\n\n>These findings are corroborated by a similar analysis of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and behaviors of more than 5,500 individuals, which reveals that internal consistency is extremely rare. Our study demonstrates that, although there are sex\/gender differences in the brain, human brains do not belong to one of two distinct categories: male brain\/female brain.\n\nBut there is a magnitude of studies that suggest otherwise, and I don't think this is an exhaustive list:\n\n[Lotze et al](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-018-38239-2)\n\n>The current study compared sex differences in the brain examining gray matter volume in two independent cohorts. We found a high reproducibility of effects between cohorts and therefore pooled the data for a unified analysis\n\n[Anderson et al](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/hbm.24462)\n\n>As expected, our results demonstrate that sexual dimorphism in brain structure is highly apparent among incarcerated samples, and the multivariate methods used to quantify gray matter allowed greater than 93% accuracy in classifying individuals as male or female.\n\nAnd sexual differences in brain sturcture highly correlate with Transexualism, as referenced by [Krujver et al](http:\/\/sindromebenjamin.tripod.com\/sitebuildercontent\/sitebuilderfiles\/brainsex1.pdf):\n\n>Differences among the groups were statistically significant by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison test\n\nAnd as linked the other day, this extensive study by [Wierenega et al](https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.02.17.952010v1.full):\n\n>The present study included a large lifespan sample and robustly confirmed previous findings of greater male variance in brain structure in humans.\n\nEven if we took the intial data by Joel et al, other experts have come to wildly different conclusions. Like [Chekroud et al](https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/113\/14\/E1968.long) for instance:\n\n>Despite the absence of dimorphic differences and lack of internal consistency observed by Joel et al. Multivariate analyses of whole-brain patterns in brain morphometry can reliably discriminate sex. These two results are not mutually inconsistent. We wholly agree that a strict dichotomy between male\/female brains does not exist, but this does not diminish or negate the importance of considering statistical differences between the sexes (e.g., including sex as a covariate in morphometric analyses).\n\n**DIFFERENCES ACROSS CULTURES:**\n\nIt is hard to measure the impact of these differences however, just as we know that [testosterone influences behaviour](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0306453018310400) (but not necessarily in ways we expect) and it is not the **only** thing that determines behaviour. So it is with average brain differences and their impact on men and women. Who's to say?\n\nIf we go by [Hydes](https:\/\/www.apa.org\/pubs\/journals\/releases\/amp-606581.pdf) hypothesis, she concluded:\n\n>It is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences. Arguably, they cause harm in numerous realms, including women\u2019s opportunities in the workplace, couple conflict and communication, and analyses of selfesteem problems among adolescents. Most important, these claims are not consistent with the scientific data.\n\nThere are some indications to the contrary though. For instance, this study by [Osmo Kontula](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/261635485_Between_sexual_desire_and_reality_The_evolution_of_sex_in_Finland), conducted across 10 european countries found:\n\n>Differences in sexual desire and values came out in many ways also in the sexual experiences that men and women had had. Even though differences in the number of sexual partners had declined, men continued to report a greater number of sex partners in their lifetime as well as more partners within the last several years, compared with women. Men were also more likely to enter into parallel relationships alongside their current relationship, and had had more such relationships than women.\n\nOr this study by [Giudice et al](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0029265), in direct contradiction to Hyde's conclusion:\n\n>The idea that there are only minor differences between the personality profiles of males and females should be rejected as based on inadequate methodology.\n\nFound:\n\n>The results were striking: the effect size for global sex differences in personality was *D*\u200a=\u200a2.71, an extremely large effect by any psychological standard, corresponding to a 10% overlap between the male and female distributions (assuming normality). Even removing the variable with the largest univariate effect size (Sensitivity), the multivariate effect was *D*\u200a=\u200a1.71 (24% overlap assuming normality). These effect sizes firmly place personality in the same category of other psychological constructs showing large, robust sex differences, such as aggression and vocational  \n>  \n>interests.\n\n[Giola et al](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/ijop.12529)\n\n>Sex differences in personality are larger in more gender equal countries. This surprising finding has consistently been found in research examining cross\u2010country differences in personality\n\n[Schmitt et al](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1002\/ijop.12265):\n\n>Even so, important gender differences in personality exist that likely stem, at least in part, from evolved psychological adaptations. Some of these adaptations generate culturally-universal gender differences, and many are further designed to be sensitive to local socioecological contexts in ways that facultatively generate varying sizes of gender differences across cultures.\n\n[Costa et al](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/11825676_Gender_Differences_in_Personality_Traits_Across_Cultures_Robust_and_Surprising_Findings\/link\/00b7d52db42cda259e000000\/download):\n\n>The present results extend to a wider range of cultures and a broader selection of personality traits conclusions reached by Feingold in his 1994 review of gender differences in personality. In brief, gender differences are modest in magnitude, consistent with gender stereotypes, and replicable across cultures\n\n[Weisberg et al](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/51594567_Gender_Differences_in_Personality_across_the_Ten_Aspects_of_the_Big_Five) suggesting sex differences, although as previously mentioned these can not be assessd on an individual level. In terms of societal trends, who knows:\n\n>Replicating previous findings, women reported higher Big Five Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism scores than men. However, more extensive gender differences were found at the level of the aspects\n\nMy favourite study along these line, by [Lee Ellis](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Lee_Ellis\/post\/What_psychological_theories_can_work_for_the_role_of_cultural_contexts_in_positive_psychology_constructs_among_males_and_females\/attachment\/59d61f8ac49f478072e97ad5\/AS%3A271751307563010%401441801968114\/download\/UniversalSexDiffPAID2011.pdf) is one that takes Hydes findings and comes to a new hypothesis known as The evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory:\n\n>While Hyde\u2019s concept can be applied to most sex differences, it should not obscure the fact that several effect sizes have been shown to far exceed 0.35. These include 0.66 for mental rotation 0.96 for throwing accuracy), 0.81 for toleration of casual sex (Oliver & Hyde, 1993), 0.87 for desired number of sex partners, 0.98 for mechanical reasoning, and 0.93 for interest in objects versus people. The extreme specificity of ENA theory makes it highly vulnerable to disproof. Sex hormones (especially testosterone) must be affecting brain functioning in at least two ways, one involving suboptimal arousal in and around the reticular formation, and the other having to do with the functional balance between the two hemispheres. One or both of these two brain functioning patterns should be responsible for most of the average universal sex difference in cognition and behavior that are documented. All the remaining universal sex differences should be attributable to evolutionary\/genetic factors or some combination of neurohormonal and evolutionary\/genetic factors. Culturally based learning should never be powerful enough to completely suppress these biological forces.  \n>  \n>This article was written with two goals in mind: The first was to document that there are many sex differences in cognition and behavior that now appear to be universal. Second, the article identifies three theoretical explanations that have been offered so far for universal sex differences: the founder effect theory of FaustoSterling (1992), the social structuralist theory of Eagly and Wood (1999, 2003), and the evolutionary theory of Buss and Schmitt (1993); Geary (2010), and Okami and Shackelford (2001). None of these theories seem to explain most of the 65 AUSDs herein identified. ENA theory offers a new explanation for universal sex differences primarily by adding specific proximate elements to a few evolutionary-genetic assumptions. In the broadest terms, ENA theory has two evolutionary-genetic components and two neurological\u2013endocrinological components\n\nMy final thought on this would be that we probably don't have enough information to reliably discern nurture from nature, although there are consistent indications across the world. While similarities are greater than the differences that doesn't mean our differences don't have an impact on the general shaping of gendered trends across society. The way I would frame it is this... Men and women are mainly the same, we all have skin, we have two eyes and olfactory sensors. Our bodies have more similarites than differences *but* the differences make a difference. Men and women have [different skin](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6116811\/), which could influence why women are more interested in skin care products or how women have better [senses of smell](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0111733) which could influence why boys tend to be more smelly, or how men have vision better suited for [motion tracking](https:\/\/bsd.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/2042-6410-3-20) and women for [distinguishing colours](https:\/\/bsd.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/2042-6410-3-21). Or the elephant in the room, woman's ability to get pregnant. Again, these aren't applicable to any one individual sex (apart the pregnancy) from  but the general trends are still there. I see brain differences in much the same way, and think it's only logical that they would be different.\n\n**Foetal Development**:\n\nDifferences in foetal development (which makes culture even less likely) [Wheelock et al](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/30901622):\n\n>We discovered both within and between network FC-GA associations that varied with sex. Specifically, associations between GA and posterior cingulate-temporal pole and fronto-cerebellar FC were observed in females only, whereas the association between GA and increased intracerebellar FC was stronger in males. These observations confirm that sexual dimorphism in functional brain systems emerges during human gestation.\n\nAnd by Baron-Cohen et al (two studies) \\[[1](http:\/\/docs.autismresearchcentre.com\/papers\/2014_B-C_Molecular%20Psychiatry_Elevated_fetal_steroidogenic_activity.pdf)\\]\\[[2](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S037837820400012X)\\]\n\n>In conclusion, we report the first direct evidence that steroidogenic activity is elevated in fetal development of those who later receive diagnoses on the autism spectrum. These results raise new questions for understanding a wide array of other observations about the early development of autism, through their interactions with early fetal steroidogenic abnormalities and provide initial support for the importance of fetal steroid hormones as important epigenetic fetal programming mechanisms for autism.\n\nAnd by [Melissa Hines](https:\/\/eje.bioscientifica.com\/view\/journals\/eje\/155\/suppl_1\/1550115.xml):\n\n>Convergent data from studies of individuals with genetic disorders, such as CAH or CAIS, offspring of pregnancies where women were treated with medications that influence testosterone, and studies relating normal variability in prenatal testosterone to postnatal behaviour, all suggest that levels of prenatal testosterone predict levels of sex-typed postnatal childhood play behaviour.\n\nAnd [Cohen-Bendahan et al](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0018506X04002326) (while this study didn't replicate findings of other studies, it does demonstrate differences in aggression linked to prenatal testosterone - and was done on twins. So prenatal testosterone is not the only influence of gendered behaviour. Though I think with the other studies we have some pretty robust findings):\n\n>Testosterone was higher in boys than girls, but similar in OS and SS twin girls. Testosterone was not in any way systematically related to the different personality traits. However, a sex difference in aggression proneness was observed, and OS girls showed a more masculine pattern of aggression proneness than the SS girls. It is argued that it is unlikely that this difference is due to social factors, such as a gender-specific upbringing.\n\n**In Tribal Communities**:\n\nIt's hard to find relevant studies on this, as this is more exploring the \"tribal societies weren't like this argument but there is evidence to suggest that women wanting a provider has [historical context](https:\/\/psmag.com\/environment\/17-to-1-reproductive-success) before the currently theorised patriarchal society developed:\n\n>Nature is a harsh taskmaster, but so, it seems, is human culture. Although the popular notion is that farming and settlement cushioned people against \"survival of the fittest,\" this study shows that's not true. Something cultural happened 8,000 years ago that's marked us even today.\n\nWhile hunter-gatherer tribes *are* more egaltarian, tasks are still seperated between gendered lines, so suggest research by [Coren et al](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/279992575_Sex_Differences_in_Competitiveness_Hunter-Gatherer_Women_and_Girls_Compete_Less_in_Gender-Neutral_and_Male-Centric_Tasks):\n\n>While we find no sex difference in willingness to compete in the female-centric task, we find that men are more likely to compete in the male-centric task. While further work is needed, this study lends some support to the idea of a sex difference in willingness to compete among hunter-gatherers, but it also highlights the importance of the task type. The observation that a sizable proportion of male Hadza choose to compete in each of the tasks is discussed in light of the fact that hunter-gatherers are largely egalitarian and non-hierarchical.\n\nUpper body strength predicts reproductive success [Coren et al](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090513814000816):\n\n>These findings suggest that selection for hunting ability may have acted on men's upper-bodies. Nevertheless, the importance of effort on strength and hunting success cannot be dismissed. This is also discussed.\n\n[Gurven et al](https:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/5768\/3b665a5461002504a63ce6b48f496f59a98a.pdf) found that the most prestigious hunters gave the best food to their families:\n\n>Many studies report biased distributions, preferential shares to acquirers and their families, or more frequent sharing to close kin outside the nuclear family\n\nThere are multiple books which support this as well (full disclosue, I have only read excerpts and second hand critiques):\n\nSchmitt, D.P.

My tentative answer is, bugger off with these lines of reasoning. Our knowledge is limited and as a layperson on the internet, who may well be an expert ( I am not), my opinion is... both. The combination of nature and nurture that makes up our personalities are so interlinked that they can not (with our current knowledge) be adequately distinguished. I think that whether nature or nurture has more of an impact would depend fully on the individual (and maybe even individual traits will be influenced to different degress by both). Some people may well be *more* biologically predisposed to react to sociological factors. With some individual traits possibly being more likely to do with nature, but that doesn't mean these same traits can't develop through nurture as well. Nature and nurture can both hace an influence on how the brain develops. We are floundering about in the dark looking for answers that don't really exist. Staing both is not only fair but the least controversial stance to take, robust evidence exists for both conclusions. *However*, this does likely mean that a one size fits all to socialisation will **not** succeed and throws a wrench into the flawed concept of social construction theory, we can not ignore the potential impacts of biology just as we can not ignore the potential impacts of socialisation. If only for the reason that we are all likely wrong in our assertions in some ways. A top down control, seems like a bad idea.\n\nI come to a point where I ask the question, with an already predermined answer, why is this such a controversial subject? My tentative answer comes to a couple of factors. For one, biological arguments have been used to restrict people in the past. It's difficult to broach this subject without some accusation of biological determinism. I don't believe this is the same thing but I can see why other's might. My argument is not to arbitarily block people, and not to be used to prescribe attributes to any one individual. My argument is descriptive. It is to say that even if we removed all barriers to success along gendered lines we would still likely see disparate outcomes. I don't know if this can be changed, which would make efforts at parity useless at best and dangeours at worst. This may be hyperbolic but I don't think so. I'm not sure arguing social determinism is any better than arguing biological determinism but there's the rub. We have a theory, dominant in certain fields of academia that is hard to get away from. I will conclude with the words of a social scientist working in the field. [Heather Metcalf](https:\/\/escholarship.org\/uc\/item\/6zf09176):\n\n>The context of much STEM workforce research is its reliance on a flawed linear model that views students and workers as passive flows through leaky pipes and its focus on numeric diversity at best. Overall, the STEM workforce studies reviewed highlight the complicated and often problematic ways in which discourse and survey research meet. They speak to the limitations of survey definitions, particularly those used to measure identity characteristics, family, STEM fields and degrees, and educational and career pathways and success. These studies also illustrate the importance of appropriately balancing disaggregating data by gender, race, class, nationality, citizenship status, field, and sector while considering interactions among these measures. This review indicates the need to critically consider claims, both in the popular and scientific press, about workforce shortages and desired demographics and the pervasive influences these claims have on workforce studies and policies. \n\nSo that's one idiot's opinion, what do y'all think?","title":"Sex Based Differences Between Male and Female Psychology - A Review of Studies I have Gathered.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/f9u6os\/sex_based_differences_between_male_and_female\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

My intent is not to post this for \"rage bait\" but to actually think through some of the points being raised there.\n\nI have two main topics to discuss on this, but they are sufficiently different I felt they deserved separate posts. This is post 1\/2 and focuses on the OP and ideology being presented, as well as my take.\n\n---\n\nThe OP expresses concern that she is afraid of having another child because that child may be a boy. She asks an interesting question:\n\n\"Do I have too much anger and trauma with the patriarchy to raise and love a healthy boy?\"\n\nThe reason I find this question interesting is because it matches exactly what I'd expect the \"gender conflict\" ideology to produce; a version of feminism (in this example) that creates an *emotional* rejection of men as a gender. By focusing on those we perceive as oppressors do we inevitably create a hatred towards that group?\n\nI'm not just picking on this particular ideology; in my view you see the same thing in critical race ideologies (hatred towards whites) and white nationalist ideologies (which often present minorities as oppressive, and are obviously hateful). It begs the question for whether or not there's something inherent to \"oppressor\/oppressed\" narratives, *regardless* of their truth, that builds resentment for those seen as oppressive.\n\nI would argue that this is an inherently toxic way to view the world. Instead of focusing on the abuses of those who are seen as the oppressor it is, in my opinion, much better to appeal to the common humanity of all people, even if they have advantages I do not. Historically rights are usually won by such appeals, not through rage and violence, based on my observation and knowledge.\n\nIs this accurate? Or is focusing on the faults of the oppressor the only way to effect change? And can we really do the latter without developing a hatred towards individuals in the oppressor group, no matter how justified we view our belief?\n\nPart of the reason I'm really interested in this is that I wonder if my personal rejection of feminism isn't at least partially rooted in the emotional response to the attitude being expressed by the OP; an attitude I *feel* is inherently hostile towards me as a person. But I'm not entirely convinced this hostility is *inherent* to feminism as an ideology.\n\nI am unsure if there isn't a dividing line within feminism that I'm not seeing clearly due to my own biases, where I reject feminism due to a perceived lack of compassion for men, a lack of compassion that is clearly not innate to feminism as a whole (there are obviously significant numbers of feminists driven by compassion for both men and women).\n\nIt's a question worth reflecting on and I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts.","title":"I don't want a baby boy - Discussion of topic from r\/gendercritical 1\/2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/cpn99m\/i_dont_want_a_baby_boy_discussion_of_topic_from\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

The consultation ends on May 31. Afterwards, the responses will be published (and, most likely, promptly forgotten). \n\n\nEven if you don't wish to fill it in, the questionnaire gives you an idea of the current EU mindset in gender policy. Here are my own quick impressions:\n\n\nMen's rights are not really on the European Commission's radar: throughout the questionnaire, the terms \"gender equality\" and \"women's rights\" are used more or less interchangeably, sometimes combined into a single phrase \"gender equality\/women's rights\". This is hardly new or surprising; after all, even the European Parliament's relevant committee is called \"Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee\". \n\n\nOften, the questionnaire takes some facts for granted, e.g., that the EU should actively push for more female involvement in the labour market, or push people into equal sharing of housework, with the only question being of choosing the right method to achieve this. If you believe that the EU's role should be limited to implementing and enforcing equal rights legislature, you will find it hard to answer many of the questions.\n\n\nApart from the clear and sensible \"equal pay for equal work\" principle, there's now also the more fuzzy and open-to-interpretation \"equal pay for work of equal value\" dictum being promoted.\n\n\nIssues like gender-based abuse, workplace harrassement, but also online hate speech are only discussed in relation to female victims.","title":"The EU wants to consult you on gender equality","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/btsoej\/the_eu_wants_to_consult_you_on_gender_equality\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

While there certainly are men who feel like this, that word has been abused so heavily by many feminists that it's essentially lost it's meaning.\n\nTo be clear, entitlement simply means you feel something is owed to you as a matter of right. It does not mean \"anything I don't like.\" It's become standard to bring up that word as much as possible. The problem is, it's often used to attack men who have standards the author disagrees with, or goes about pursuing women in a way the author disagrees with.\n\nFor example, older men who chase after younger women do not feel entitled unless they do something to suggest they think that younger women owe them sex, they're simply pursuing women that they happen to be interested in, and who some people believe they should not pursue. Men who want sexbots don't feel entitled to anyone, they just want a sex toy but even then they're accused of entitlement despite not even talking about actual people. If you as a man complain about being unable to find a relationship, you are not being entitled unless you suggest that you're owed something. Most recently, we had a thread in this sub about a man who was bullied into withdrawing from a university election for campaigning about men's mental health who was forced to withdraw being accused of entitlement.\n\nIt looks to me as if \"entitlement\" has taken to mean any man who wants to draw attention to men's issues that some people disagree with, and who do things in the romantic world that are disapproved of by feminists even if they don't act as if women or a particular woman owes them sex by right, they just have standards that some disagree with.\n\nThe word entitlement has been flung around so much that most of the time when it's used in this context I honestly just roll my eyes. Now yes, I acknowledge certain men can and do feel and act entitled, but this word has been misused so much it's essentially lost all it's meaning.","title":"\"Entitlement\" has lost it's meaning","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/9tqbss\/entitlement_has_lost_its_meaning\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

We were students, waiting in front of a classroom for a teacher. We were in the first grade (EDIT: at university), it was September, most of us didn't know each other yet. So I decided to break ice, and said \"hi\" to a few people. So far, all of them seemed happy that someone else took initiative. Then I talked with them shortly, and introduced them to other people I have met previously, and moved to the next target.\n\nThis girl had a book with her. So, instead of the usual \"Hi!\" opener, I decided to try something more specific. I said: \"Hi! I see you have a book. Something interesting?\"\n\nShe looked at me coldly and said: \"It's about feminism. But I don't think you would be interested. It's about how men oppress women. See, you probably already hate me now. You don't have to hide it.\" She seemed ready to fight.\n\nI was shocked for a moment. I considered telling her that actually I have signed up for an optional Gender Studies class, but... I realized that I feel pushed to apologize for... I don't even know what. And I refuse that kind of manipulation, on principle. So I just shrugged, and moved away.\n\nI cannot know what happened in her mind, but my guess is that she mentally congratulated herself for proudly defying yet another misogynist.\n\nAnd I realized that I do actually dislike her. So her prophecy, at least the part about her, became true.\n\n.\n\nThis is a more general pattern, not only in situations related to gender or human interaction, but everything. If we believe that something is a danger, then whenever we see it and run away, it feels exactly like having escaped from a real danger. So even if the thing we run away from is completely harmless, even the repeated experience will *not* make us less afraid. The repeated exposure will only convince us that the danger is everywhere, so we should be more careful about it.\n\n.\n\nI can easily imagine that the girl I mentioned had some previous bad experience with some man, or with multiple men. And then she just generalized. And then found a philosophy which, when seen from a proper angle, seemed to fit her idea.\n\nBut it is not necessary for something like this to start with a *personal* bad experience. It could also be just something that other people tell you. Or what you read in a book or a web page. As long as you start feeling afraid enough that you start running away from the perceived danger, you are at risk of creating your bubble of reality where you have no positive experience, and a lot of fear.\n\n.\n\nAlso, when you give something a name, when you start seeing it as a pattern, it grows big in your mind. The individual experiences that fit the pattern become pieces of a coherent story. The individual experiences that don't fit the pattern become forgotten.\n\nI had a debate later, with a different girl. She asked me: \"Why do so many men hurt women?\"\n\nI already knew something about her background, so I asked her: \"Can you tell me a list of all people who significantly hurt *you* personally?\" She said: \"Well, my mother was very abusive. My father doesn't actually hurt me, he just ignores me. I had a horrible (female) classmate at school. I had an abusive (female) boss, and then an abusive (male) boss in a different company. Those are people who hurt me most.\"\n\nI reminded her that the majority of people she mentioned were actually women. So why is she so concerned about *men* hurting her, instead of simply *bad people* hurting her? She said she never thought about it this way.\n\nBut I think it's easy to understand why. She already had this cultural narrative that men hurt women. She didn't have a corresponding narrative about women hurting women. So whenever a man hurt her somehow, it became an evidence confirming the story. When a woman hurt her, that was... merely a bad *individual*; each one of those women was merely an exception; there was no story to be confirmed. This is why she felt her personal experience confirms the narrative of men hurting women, even when the facts in her life suggested otherwise.\n\n.\n\nWhen there is a community which, for whatever reason, contains more men then women, it is easy to accuse them of misogyny. You don't have to work hard to make your case. You just throw at them whatever accusation comes to your mind, and when the community tries to defende themselves, you say: \"Yeah, yeah, you have so many clever excuses, but look at yourself and tell me whether you have an equal amount of women. No, you don't. Which proves that I am right and you are not.\" (Then, if you are a woman, you can demand from them to make whatever changes you fancy, because as a woman you are totally an expert on how *all* women feel, what *all* women want, etc. And when some woman in the group contradicts you, well, she has internalized misogyny from spending too much time in the misogynistic group, or something like this.)\n\nNow let's look at it from outside. If you are a woman, and there is some community that seems interesting, but people keep telling you that the members of that community hate women, are you more likely to go there and investigate for yourself whether it's really the case, or you just thank them for pointing out the danger? Well, some women *are* adventurous and will go there to find out, but I guess most of them will prefer safety.\n\nThis is another self-fulfilling prophecy: Publicly call a group misogynist, because they don't have enough women. Women start avoiding the group. More proof they are misogynist. Ask the group to change according to your whims. They refuse. See, they are not even trying to become more comfortable to women. (But in reality, it's your description that keep increasing the discomfort of the women outside of the group.)\n\nAnd it gets even worse. If you publicly describe a group as misogynist, then people who *are* misogynist will be more likely to join the group, because you have just advertized it for them. Also, if you start attacking the group *in the name of women*, members will start resenting this argument, and the less enlightened of them may actually start resenting women. Also, after this experience, when a new woman comes, she will be automatically suspect of trying to do the same thing.\n\n(Yes, this text is motivated by GamerGate, but I have seen the same thing done in different places.)\n\n.\n\nProviding positive *role models* seems like a good way to attract women somewhere. Unfortunately, people who try to do this often don't do their homework, and then their results are not convincing.\n\nThe usual example of a successful woman in computer science is Ada Lovelace. She is usually hyped as the author of the first computer program ever. I am not a historian, and every time I read Wikipedia, it suggests a different story, so I am just confused on this topic. (Lovelace certainly contributed *somehow*, but whether the program was originally her idea, whether she wrote the original version of the program, or improved someone else's program, or whether she was merely the first one to *publish* the program in an article... different people will give you different answers.) Anyway, Ada Lovelace is often the first and the last example of a woman in computing. So, at best that suggests that women were doing computer science *in a different century*; but what about now?\n\nFor me, Grace Hopper would be a more impressive example. She invented COBOL, wrote the first compiler, coined the word \"debugging\". The only problem is that appreciating these achievements requires some pre-existing knowledge of computer science (what is COBOL? what is a compiler? what is debugging?), while \"a first computer program\" is a soundbite you can sell to anyone. That's the problem with trying to describe science to non-scientists; you must find some simple and sometimes misleading explanation.\n\nMaybe a [list of women in videogame industry](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/g4EyhNc.jpg) would be more impressive for the young generation. It certainly impressed me. If I were still a teacher, I would totally print this and put in on the classroom door.\n\nOn the other hand, suggesting that Zoe Quinn and her Depression Quest are the pinnacle of female contribution to computer science, that's outright offensive to all these women and their hard work. It erases their contributions better than any misogynist could. It feels like the \"exception that proves the rule\" about computers being solely a male hobby.\n\n.\n\nSo, if you feel there are not enough women somewhere (e.g. in computer science), DO NOT start a huge media campaign about misogyny because that will probably only *make things worse*. Instead, DO highlight the women who are *already there*; not just one of them, but at least a dozen, so you don't create an image of a lonely woman, but of female contribution being a normal thing.\n\nOf course, this supposes you actually care about women in general, instead of just trying to insert *yourself* as the lonely hero which saves the day. Because in that case, all competition must be ignored. It is only you against the hostile savage hordes. You, and your Patreon account.","title":"Misogyny: a self-fulfilling prophecy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2kaq25\/misogyny_a_selffulfilling_prophecy\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

Hundreds knew about it, and yet nobody did anything for a long, long time. When stuff was done, an entire movement was created. Obviously, Weinstein's Hollywood was (and modern Hollywood probably still is) a rape culture, but it is not representative of society's thoughts towards rape as a whole - it's a large drop in an otherwise empty bucket.\n\nBrock Turner and other fratty assholes also showcase elements of rape culture - but again, these are enclosed environments, and when these communities are exposed, society as a whole condemns them both legally and socially.\n\nThe rape kit backlog is the only element of rape culture that I know of that exists on a societal scale in the western world - particularly in the US.\n\nA lot of people believe that the skepticism of the public and law enforcement when it comes to sexual assault or rape is an element of rape culture, but I'm not too sure.\n\nNow, the US was definitely a rape culture in the past - the first state to outlaw spousal rape was Michigan, and it did so in **1974**. For reference, Samuel L. Jackson was 26 when that happened. [(Source)](https:\/\/sites.williams.edu\/engl113-f18\/flagler\/a-brief-history-of-rape-law\/#:~:text=And%2C%20in%201974%2C%20Michigan%20created,outlawed%20spousal%20rape%20(Bevacqua)).\n\nSo the western world was a rape culture in the past, but that has been worked on since. Now it is still at least partially a rape culture for women - due to the existence of the rape kit backlog, and the  \noccasional enclosed rape culture that crops up.\n\nNow to the part that I really wish I wasn't typing.\n\nThe thing is, when we look at elements of rape culture by *women* against *men,* it's a much more clear-cut answer.\n\nThe first element - if you're anything like me, or most people in the western world, you've already attempted to mentally deny female on male rape culture in the western world as soon as I even suggested it were possible. Chances are you did this almost automatically - as I did a few months ago.\n\nThe second element - It's not treated as rape in media nearly as often enough. Go to google right now, and search \"Teacher has sex with underage student\" - and look at the mugshots. Now, google \"Teacher rapes underage student\", and look at the mugshots. See a pattern?\n\nThird element - the legal definition - As I stated before, spousal rape was outlawed in 1974, finally being defined as rape under the law in Michigan, with every other state and the federal government eventually following suit.\n\nThat's all well and horrible, but it's nothing compared to the fact that female-on-male rape in the western world. In the US, female on male rape wasn't treated as rape - but mere sexual assault and battery. Not until 1974, but until **2012.** [(Source)](https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/archives\/opa\/blog\/updated-definition-rape). In England and Wales, the legal definition for rape still uses male pronouns:\n\n\"1) A person (A) commits an offence if\u2014  \n(a) **he** intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with **his penis**,  \n(b) B does not consent to the penetration, and  \n(c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.\" [(Source)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rape_in_English_law#:~:text=(1)%20A%20person%20).\n\nThere are dozens of countries who have definitions like that, but frankly I don't really like thinking about this that much and I don't really want to pursue it further.\n\nFunnily enough, the CDC - an American agency, still uses the old\/british definition of rape, even dedicating a paragraph to explaining how for men, non-consensual sex and rape are two completely different things. [(Source)](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/intimatepartnerviolence\/men-ipvsvandstalking.html).\n\n\"MTP is a form of sexual violence that some in the practice field consider similar to rape\"\n\nThis outdated definition is ingrained within so, so many studies and governments that I am both unable and unwilling to list them all.\n\nFourth element - whodunnit - You'll  hear a lot of people cite my previous CDC source when talking about rape against men - after all, it's the study that says \"87% of male victims of \\[rape\\] reported only male perpetrators.\" They then use this to suggest that it is an issue enclosed to men.\n\nBut then these same people don't look even one line down - Remember, that 87% metric is using the old definition of rape - the one that explicitly excludes male victims of female perpetrators.\n\nIf you read on, you get the second stat: \"79% of male victims of being MTP reported only female perpetrators.\" Seventy nine percent - a large majority of male victims of rape - if you use the new definition - are raped by women.\n\nFifth and final element - commonality - We also hear about how common male on female rape is, and how rare female on male rape is. People agree that it happens, but then they say it's rare and not comparable to male on female rape. Another CDC study has this statement. I am going to quote the entire paragraph, verbatim. [Here](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/sexualviolence\/fastfact.html#:~:text=Sexual%20violence%20is%20common.,penetrate%20someone%20during%20his%20lifetime) is the source I am using, you can find it there.\n\n\"**Sexual violence is common**. Over half of women and almost 1 in 3 men have experienced sexual violence involving physical contact during their lifetimes. One in 4 women and about 1 in 26 men have experienced completed or attempted rape. About 1 in 9 men were made to penetrate someone during his lifetime. Additionally, 1 in 3 women and about 1 in 9 men experienced sexual harassment in a public place.\"\n\nNow, that 1 in 26 metric is part of that old definition from earlier.\n\nFor the real number - at least from those surveyed by the CDC, we have to go to the MTP metric, which is 1 in 9. Divide that by our 79% metric from earlier, and you get 8.7% - meaning just under 1 in 11 men is the victim of an attempted rape by a woman at least once in his lifetime.\n\nThis is much more comparable to that same source's statistic for women - that being 1 in 4 - or 25%. Now, the overwhelming majority of people who rape women are men. Sources vary from 90-99%.\n\nBonus element: The rape kit backlog - men get rape kits done too, you know. The backlog affects them too. That element of male on female rape culture I mentioned earlier is actually unisex.\n\nAnd here we reach my conclusion that I hate I had to make.\n\nJust above one quarter of rape victims are male victims of female perpetrators - if these already clearly biased studies are to be believed. This is significantly higher than the percentage of murder victims that are female, and murder is treated like an everyone issue on the best of days.\n\nAnd yet, rape is treated as an issue that exclusively women face at the hands of exclusively men. And the studies just... don't support that. It's a majority, but not nearly enough of one to justify the disconnect in how male and female rape victims are treated.\n\nSo I guess my question is:\n\nWith a quarter of rape victims being male victims of female perpetrators,\n\nStudies and laws across the world being worded to explicitly exclude male victims,\n\nThe fact that in news cycles, it's treated as 'sex' instead of what it is - rape. Remember what I told you to google earlier.\n\nAnd also - the rape kit backlog. Do you seriously think it only affects women? 1 in 4 rape victims is a male victim of a female offender. Men get rape kits too, and they are also the victim of this element of rape culture.\n\nIs the western world a rape culture that disproportionately affects men? If not, then what is it currently, and what would it take for it to be one?\n\nSorry for the long post. I'm tired, man.","title":"Men and Rape Culture - An Open Discussion (Long post)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/15mk5p2\/men_and_rape_culture_an_open_discussion_long_post\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":true}

It is argued for, sympathetically, in [The Fresno Bee](http:\/\/www.sacbee.com\/opinion\/california-forum\/article177324971.html).  SAVE [makes the following criticisms](http:\/\/www.saveservices.org\/camp\/sb-169-we-can-do-better\/) (which notably do *not* include criticism of the preponderance of evidence standard)\n\n1) SB-169 Section 3 (a): fails to define \u201cincapable of giving consent,\u201d which will lead to an array of interpretations and result in inconsistent application of the statute among institutions.  It would be far more effective to use the term \u201cincapacitated,\u201d thereby providing a more definitive threshold and more likely to be within the capabilities of campus administrators to assess.\n\n2) SB-169 Section 3 (d): \u201cSexual violence means sexual coercion.\u201d  This wording is unacceptably vague: what is \u201csexual coercion?\u201d  Is it considered \u201ccoercion\u201d when one party asks a partner for sex twice within an hour?  Six times over the course of an evening?\n\n3) SB-169 Section 4: Mandates that elementary and secondary school boards implement training, investigation and adjudication procedures, and assign a school employee to act as a \u201csex equity coordinator.\u201d  There is no requirement, however, that these persons possess any training, knowledge, or skill in handling sexual assault investigations and adjudications in the \u201cadequate, reliable, and impartial\u201d manner that is required by SB-169.\n\n4) SB-169 Section 4 (c)(3)(C): Requires grievance procedures to provide both parties the opportunity to present witnesses and evidence. Unfortunately, there is no clarification with respect to the types of evidence admissible, how the evidence is to be accessed or presented, the parties\u2019 rights to question evidence, rules for disclosure or sequestration, rape shield rules, etc.\n\n5) SB-169 Section 4 (c)(3)(G)(iii): allows complainants to appeal a finding of \u201cnot responsible.\u201d Allowing such an appeal is tantamount to double jeopardy.\n\n6) SB-169 Section 4 (d): \u201cAny procedures used to adjudicate complaints of sexual harassment, including disciplinary procedures, shall afford a complainant a prompt and equitable resolution.\u201d This requirement reveals inherent bias for a complainant; an equitable instruction must require a prompt and equitable resolution for both parties.\n\n7)SB-169 Section 4 (f): \u201cA school shall ensure that steps taken to accord due process rights to the alleged perpetrator do not restrict or unnecessarily delay the protections for the complainant.\u201d What protections of due process could possibly harm the complainant? Schools should never be required to decide between due process and respectful treatment of complainants. Both are capable of being provided simultaneously.\n\n8) SB-169 Section 4 (i): would require that if a school detects harassment creating a hostile environment, the school shall \u201celiminate the hostile environment.\u201d This provision could be interpreted to encourage expulsion as the remedy to any incident.  Given the vast array of potential sexual harassment allegations, the Bill should not predetermine a one size fits all penalty.\n\n9) SB-169 Section 4 (k): In part, states that the regulations shall include all provisions of the OCR April 4, 2011 19-page letter that are \u201cnot covered in this section.\u201d It is inappropriate for a statute to impose unarticulated responsibilities on schools, especially when those responsibilities have been uniformly criticized and results of their application so obviously ineffective at resolving the intended problems.\n\n----\nNCFM has sent a letter to Governor Jerry Brown that reads:\n\nDear Governor Brown,\n\n \n\nWe oppose SB-169 Education \u2013 sex equity; and, any similar legislation\n\n \n\nThe infamous U.S. Department of Education (DOE) 2011 Dear Colleague Letter directed higher-educational institutions to investigate, adjudicate, and resolve allegations of student-on-student sexual misconduct.  It required schools too:\n\n \n\n1.       Use the lowest standard of evidentiary proof, a preponderance-of-evidence standard, albeit a coin-flip.\n2.       Allow complainants to appeal not-guilty findings, rather than facilitate appeals for the accused.\n3.       Discourage cross-examination.\n4.       Prohibit relying on law-enforcement investigation determinations.\n5.       Resolve complaints expeditiously.\n6.       Directed that fundamental due-process protections not hinder the resolution of charges.\n \nThe Dear Colleague Letter intentionally targeted males and facilitated false allegations of sexual harassment and assault. It disrupted and destroyed the lives of hundreds of students (and their families), including several students who committed suicide. Moreover, numerous schools have been sued, paid hefty sums, and lawsuits are pending. Both the DOE directive and proposed California legislation cause the malevolently bizarre concept of guilty, even after proven innocent.\n\n \n\nIf the true purpose of SB-169 is to ensure \u201c\u2026that all persons, regardless of their sex, should enjoy freedom from discrimination of any kind in the educational institutions of the state,\u201d then it is sorely deficient. Like its predecessor, the Dear Colleague Letter, SB-169 targets males. Anyone who says differently is disingenuous and has no concern or concept of freedom from discrimination regardless of a person\u2019s sex.\n\n \n\nMoreover, SB-169 extends itself into secondary education institutions. If it becomes law hundreds, perhaps thousands, of our children will be wrongly labeled sex offenders and have their lives seriously affected if not destroyed by false accusations. Like our universities, lawsuits will soon burden our secondary schools and the families of the falsely accused who bear the ruinous cost of litigation, financial and emotional.\n\n \n\nThe damage done by the Dear Colleague Letter is incalculable. There are no known positive outcomes \u2013 none. There is no evidence to suggest the letter saved anyone from sexual harassment or assault. There is no reason to believe SB-169 will be any better; but clearly, there are sufficient reasons to believe outcomes will be substantially worse.\n\n \n\nPlease help defeat this legislation. It is not well intentioned. It is ideologically driven and devoid of substance. In fact, in application, it will be wicked. It is counter to common sense, civility and all things good in our culture and society.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to include these two responses because they provide specific criticisms both of the proposed legislation, and the previous title ix advisories.\n\nSo- what do you think?  Are MRAs and SAVE raising reasonable objections?  Is this rape apologia?  What say you?\n","title":"In response to Devos softening title ix restrictions, California seeks to enshrine them into law.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/74qs6i\/in_response_to_devos_softening_title_ix\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

That is, the morality of an attack is dependent on the power relationship between the attacker and the target.\n\n\"Attack\" here captures a broad range of actions. The only requirement is that it be something done deliberately by the \"attacker\" to harm the target, their feelings or their image.\n\nTo \"punch up\" is to attack from the less-powerful position. This is a heroic act, bravely fighting your oppressors. To \"punch down\" is to attack from the more-powerful position. This is a shameful act, bullying those already suffering.\n\nThe problem here is that the judgement of whether one is punching up or down is based not on an objective fact but on perception. That perception is guided by the dominant cultural narratives.\n\nThere is a massive social benefit to being perceived to be a victim. You can attack with impunity, even be commended for making the attack. Meanwhile, attacking you, even in retaliation, is taboo.\n\nThis creates a motivation to paint oneself as a victim. Even better if you can paint yourself as a member of a victim class. This way your own personal privileges can be ignored when measuring the morality of the attacks you make.\n\nA female journalist, writing for a widely-read publication is in a much more powerful position than the average man. However, she's a woman, a member of a recognized victim class. If she writes an article attacking men, she's considered to be punching up. Any man who responds negatively is branded a bully.\n\nI believe that this is the reason so many modern feminists focus not on empowering women but on portraying them as disempowered. Maintaining the victim narrative secures this social power, not for the genuinely disempowered women but for the powerful minority who shares in their underdog status merely by association.\n\nNot that this is unique to feminism. Many on the MRM side also engage in these \"Oppression Olympics\" trying to gain the label of victim for themselves.","title":"Punching up and the moral superiority of victimhood","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/35967d\/punching_up_and_the_moral_superiority_of\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

I really do not beleive this to be true, and it is why I do not necessarily label myself as a Feminist.\n  \nThis point is often brought up in discussions when people talk about \"true\" feminists. Many arguments say that everyone should be a Feminist, and that most people in Western society are, even if they do not label themselves as such. I find this argument to be disingenous, Feminism cannot simply be a belief in equality between the genders, as it is also a social movement backed by decades of academic theory.\n  \nTo be a feminist is to accept the academic theories behind feminism. Many feminists reject CH Sommers as not a feminist because of her beliefs, but doesn't she believe in equality between the genders? The reason she is rejected is because of her dismissal of feminist ideas such as rape-culture. Wouldn't MRAs also be feminists if that statement is true?\n  \nThat is why I find it hard to accept the argument (pervasive in the general public, and in some subs on reddit) that all people who believe in gender equality are feminists. This sort of forced labeling should be dismissed on both sides.

Not even ONCE. I'm amazing. No need to tell me, I already know.\n\nThere's a concept within feminism called Schrodinger's Rapist. It basically means that if you're interacting with an unknown man, he might be a rapist, and perhaps caution is advisable. If you're a 140lb woman walking alone downtown at night and a 190lb man begins to follow you, Schrodinger's Rapist advises a healthy amount of fear. Perhaps don't turn down any dark alleys. Reach into your purse for your whistle, or your aerosol \"bear repellent\". Don't spray him unless he actually starts doing bad things, but maintain situational awareness and preparedness just in case. Odds are, he's just some guy walking home. And even if he does end up doing something you don't like, it's probably going to be limited to verbal harassment, or maybe he's just after a nice and easy mugging and has selected you because he has complete combat superiority over you. But he might be a rapist. So get your hand on the whistle, and consider dialing \"91\". (For those of you who live in stupid countries where 911 isn't the number for the cops, dial the first n-1 numbers of whatever number is the cops, where n is the number of numbers in their number.) \"91\" is my solution every time. Strange noise from upstairs? Dial 9-1, then go up and check it out. Strange man following you? Dial 9-1, try to find out your current address. That way, if they turn out to be a rapist, all you need to do is dial 1. Cops have a response time of like, not very long, especially in high-crime areas.\n\nThen there's some fucks like Annette, who seem to think that Schrodinger's Rapist means that if some man seems to be following you downtown at night, you should immediately whip out your \"bear repellent\" and repel the shit out of his eyes, that way, if he's a rapist, he's not going to be in a tactically optimal situation. And if he's not a rapist, well---um....whoopsie-doopsie.\n\nOh, I forgot, let's chuck race in there too. There's a strange _Indian_ man following you. Now what do you do? Obviously, since my land is such a wretched hive of scum and villainy, he's like 99% rapist, so you'd best whip out the 9mm and fill him with lead right now.","title":"Let's take some racism, throw in some sexism, and voila!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2ygoyr\/lets_take_some_racism_throw_in_some_sexism_and\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

My most recent discovery is quite disturbing, there seems to be a quite deliberate and intentional tactic of publicly humiliating and shaming men into changing their behaviour.\n\nOn the *US Aid* website I found the conference proceedings for a 1993 *Seminar on Women's Health and Nutrition Best Practices* [1] sponsored by the World Bank. Annex 3.1 is a summary of Lori Heise, Jacqueline Pitanguy, and Adrienne Germain's paper *Violence Against Women: The Hidden Health Burden* [2].\n\nIt's not surprising that the *US Aid* copy of the conference proceedings has \"*Not For Citation*\" hand written on the first page of each annex article.\n\n> Gender violence requires a life cycle approach, examining and dealing with the issue through prebirth, infancy, girlhood, adolescence and adulthood. It also requires a multi-dimensional approach, and collaboration from many sectors, public and private, including the justice system, the health care system and providers, and victim-assistance agencies and support groups. An effective program must be site-specific and emerge out of the cultural and political realities of each country. \n>\n> Violence must be made visible. Interventions must: \n>\n> + Eliminate attitudes and beliefs that legitimize violence and justify male control of female behavior; \n> + Treat the symptoms and effects of abuse; and \n> + Improve women's access to power and resources. \n>\n> A comprehensive strategy should have three goals: \n>\n> **Prevention:** \n>\n> + Increase the social cost through enforced laws and public humiliation.\n> + Change attitudes and perceptions using media, public education, family life and parenting skills programs, in schools, religious institutions, all male clubs and after-school programs.\n> + Encourage non-violent resolutions through schools and the media.\n> + Alleviate social factors through regulating alcohol sale and treatment, gun control and support groups for men in transition.\n> + Utilize health core providers to discourage violence, sex discrimination and harmful practices, counsel women and refer them for legal or psychological support, and help document the incident of violence and its impact.\n> + Improve women's alternatives, through skills training, access to income, low-income housing and all female spaces.\n>\n> **Victim Assistance:**\n>\n> + Protect women through laws, emergency housing, self-defense training and safe public spaces.\n> + Empower victims through self-help support groups, legal and psychological counseling and use of women's advocates.\n> + Respond constructively by training for professionals and educators and implementing protocols to recognize and respond to gender violence.\n>\n> **Knowledge:**\n>\n> + Document prevalence of violence through population-based surveys.\n> + Fund research into causes and correlates of violence.\n> + Evaluate innovative approaches to prevention and victim support. [1 pp 55-56]\n\nAnd one of the priorities for governmental action is to give funding to feminist organisations to implement these intervention strategies.\n\n> Provide technical and financial support for NGOs offering services to and on behalf of women, \nespecially those working from a feminist perspective [1 pp 56]\n\nIt's not only the *World Bank* where this group of researchers and activists have proposed shame and humiliation as a tactic, they have also done the same thing at the United Nations (emphasis mine).\n\n> To stop violence against women, each society needs to look at itself and to challenge those values and beliefs that reinforce male violence.\n> \n> Experts taking part in an October 1993 meeting on violence against women organized by the UN's Division for the Advancement of Women felt that each type of violence required its own remedy. Some solutions might come through the legal system and the police function of the State. Others might require the use of public institutions, like the educational system, to influence values and attitudes. Still others might require opinion leadership by community leaders and the mass media. *Acceptance of responsibility publicly to shame persons who violate the norm of no violence can also be an effective measure.*  As the experts concluded, \"rather than the punishment fitting the crime, it is more a matter of the prevention fitting the cause\". [3]\n\nThey have even expanded the definition of what was considered violence against women.\n\n> Ms. Heise and her associates have come up with their own definition of violence against women: Any act of verbal or physical force, coercion, or life-threatening deprivation, directed at an individual women or girl, that causes physical or psychological harm, humiliation or arbitrary deprivation of liberty and that perpetuates female subordination. [3]\n\nThis seems quite contradictory as \"a verbal act causing humiliation\" is violence against women, but the very same act directed at a man is seen as acceptable, it's just \"a matter of the prevention fitting the cause\".\n\nIt's also interesting to see that Heise et. al. also expanded their definition of violence against women to include cosmetic surgery and eating disorders.\n\n> We suggest broadening this concept to include harmful practices and behaviors common in industrial societies which are likewise motivated by a desire to make women  into acceptable, attractive sexual partners for men. These include pathological dieting (anorexia and bulimnia) and high-risk cosmetic surgery. [2 pp 12]\n\nA lot of the issues I have with modern feminism all comes back to Charlotte Bunch and the *Center for Global Women's Leadership*. It's not just advocacy, it is a matter of tactics and it goes a lot deeper than many may think.\n\nPart of the approach is to place feminists in influential positions and institutionalise any gains that are made.\n\n> Yet the task of bringing about such broad-reaching change remains formidable. The most direct route, participants concluded, would be to influence mainstream organizations from a more feminist perspective. This requires networking among groups about jobs that feminists could fill. Alternatively, feminists can seek out and support progressives who are already working inside such organizations. Crucial to this approach,  however, is a change in feminist culture which now tends to see working in the mainstream as a \"sell-out.\"\n> \n> The movement needs both grassroots activists outside and women in positions of power inside who can help institutionalize our gains. Individuals who choose to work from positions of power must remain  accountable to their constituencies, and both those inside and outside of such structures must work together to develop better mechanisms for maintaining communication and strengthening each other's work. [5 pp 24]\n\nAnother part of the approach is to combat \"*the dilution of feminism in worldwide activities around women's issues, through, for example, the growth of non-feminist \"gender experts\" in non-governmental organizations*\" [6 pp 94].\n\nThis strategy is something they have been quite successful in achieving (for example getting judges appointed at the ICC with [Catherine MacKinnon](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2cnnrd\/why_was_forced_male_circumcision_in_kenya_not\/) appointed as a gender expert).\n\nBeing able to go right to the First Lady of the United States is also somewhat of an advantage.\n\n> And the fact is that even before Bush, the U.S. was a superpower.  Plus, the U.S. had been the largest donor to the population field. It had a lot of weight. So, as I say, we were determined to reshape the U.S. policy. And that was fine with the Clinton White House because, you know, they\u2019re - Clinton was a pro-choice president. Hillary and I are classmates. Whenever we got into difficulties with the State Department bureaucrats, I could pass the message to Hillary and say, Hil, you know\u2014and they were great. They were really \u2014 it was good. And then, we had all these contacts in other countries. And we really worked hard to support people and help them get  on their government delegations, and then brought others who weren\u2019t on their governments but from key countries. Because all these negotiations - there are always lead countries of various - I won\u2019t bore you with the details. \n> \n> So, we had a whole thing. And we\u2019d make travel grants and we brought everybody. And then, the strategy basically is to meet every day. We would all meet the day before and get everybody up to speed on all the issues. And you meet every day at six or seven in the morning and divvy up the work plan - who\u2019s going to lobby which governments and do what on that particular day.\n> \n> It\u2019s a whole system now that we developed. And we\u2019re the only ones really who have done this in our field consistently through this work. In the women\u2019s rights arena, Charlotte Bunch and the Center for Global Women's Leadership [Center for Women\u2019s Global Leadership], a focal center for women\u2019s rights\u2014anyway, whatever it is at Rutgers is the leader on the human rights, women\u2019s human rights side. [7 pp 158-159]\n\nAll the biased research and recommendations I have found so far (and that other MRAs have been highly critical of) that have come out of the Centers for Disease Control, Department of Justice, United Nations, World Health Organisation, World Bank, and other organisations all come back to this group of researchers and activists. If you pick up the findings of any report or study that MRAs highly criticise, the vast majority of them are done by, or heavily cite, Lori Heise, Jacquelyn Campbell, Mary Koss, Charlotte Watts, Rachel Jewkes, and a few others I have been also been critical of. If you also look at the papers of these authors you'll see that they heavily cite each other and rarely cite contemporary intimate partner violence research performed by non-feminist academics.\n\nMen are the problem and they need to be shamed and humiliated.\n\n1.

The gendered media bias is _extreme_ and very noticeable. If you look at literally _any_ report concerning the abduction of the female students, you will see their gender in the headline. You will not find a single \"Over 200 students kidnapped\" example. They will _all_ say 'schoolgirls'. Now look at the media reporting of the following school Attacks:\n\n* Yobe State school shooting in July 2013 - 29 'students' killed, according to [New York Daily News](http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/world\/30-killed-school-attack-islamic-militants-nigeria-article-1.1391617) Fails to mention that [all 29 of the students were boys.]( http:\/\/www.thisdaylive.com\/articles\/boko-haram-militants-kill-29-students-teacher-in-yobe-school-attack\/152599\/) \n\n* Gujba school attack in September 2013 - as many as 50 'students' dead according to [Al Jazeera]( http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/africa\/2013\/09\/gunmen-storm-nigerian-college-201392910646471222.html). What they don't tell you is that [only the male hostels were targeted.](http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2013\/09\/29\/college-provost-says-suspected-islamic-extremists-kill-about-50-students-in\/)\n\n* Buni Yade attack in February 2014 - [43 'students' were killed](http:\/\/www.vanguardngr.com\/2014\/02\/b-haram-slaughters-43-students-yobe\/), all male. Reports emerge of girls being taken hostage, but [other reports don't confirm this](http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-26338041), saying \"Teachers at the school in Buni Yadi said the gunmen gathered the female students together before telling them to go away and get married and to abandon their education.\"\n\nI make that, then, 122 boys\/young male students killed in Boko Haram attacks targetting schools. I could only find one media report in which the word 'schoolboy' was used - [this one](http:\/\/www.theaustralian.com.au\/news\/world\/boko-haram-slaughter-29-schoolboys-in-nigerian-boarding-house-attack\/story-e6frg6so-1226837939695) from The Australian. Across the board, they were always referred to as 'pupils' or 'students'.\n\nI could end there, but you may be wondering about how things look with other attacks. It's less clear-cut, I'd say, but you can still identify clear gender bias in media reports:\n\n* Bama attack in May 2013 - 55 'people' dead. Except actually, as [this BBC report hides in the small print](http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-22444417), it was 3 children, 1 woman, and 51 men, 13 of which were insurgents.\n\n* Konduga attack on a village in February 2014 - [57  killed](http:\/\/www.punchng.com\/news\/borno-attack-death-toll-rises-to-57\/). Some reports of 20\/21 girls taken hostage. Obviously, the girls getting kidnapped is the main issue, according to [Weekly Trust](http:\/\/www.weeklytrust.com.ng\/index.php\/top-stories\/15722-fear-as-insurgents-abduct-young-girls-in-konduga). Except it turns out that it was [bollocks]( http:\/\/www.informationng.com\/2014\/03\/boko-haram-didnt-abduct-20-borno-girls-police-school-mgt.html).\n \n* Izge Rana attacks in February 2014 in which 90 are people killed in a village.  [Here](http:\/\/cir.ca\/news\/boko-haram-nigeria-attacks-feburary-2014) we get the fabled \"At least 90 people were killed, **including women and children**, according to officials and witnesses.\" Surely not including women and children? If only they hadn't done that!\n \n* Bama attack in February 2014 on the same village as the one in May. [The Daily Telegraph](http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/africaandindianocean\/nigeria\/10642979\/Boko-Haram-kill-over-100-in-village-massacre.html) reports that over 100 'people' are left dead. But they then quote Senator Ali Ndume who says \" \u201cA hundred and six people, including an old woman, have been killed by the attackers, suspected to be Boko Haram gunmen.\" Whether that means some of the other people were merely younger women or girls, I do not know, but we can be reasonably confident they'd say if they were. \n \n* Maiduguri attack in March 2014 in which 51 are left dead in a bomb attack, according to [Al Jazeera America](http:\/\/america.aljazeera.com\/articles\/2014\/3\/1\/bomb-blasts-hit-crowdedmarketinnigeria.html). References the 'two recent attacks' in which 'students' were killed, although it's unclear which ones. Presumably the Buni Yade attack? Another village, [Mainok, is attacked on the same day, killing 39.](http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2014\/03\/02\/world\/africa\/nigeria-blasts\/)\n \n* Kala Balge and Dikwa attacks in March 2014 in which 68 people are killed. On this occasion, [according to Reuters](http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2014\/03\/02\/world\/africa\/nigeria-blasts\/), it seems as though the violence genuinely is pretty indiscriminate: \"They entered at night. They killed my brother Madu. The insurgents shot him in front of his wife and two sons. Then they shot them, too.\" \n \nOverall, however, what we see from Boko Haram is a strongly _gendered_ campaign of terror. In general, the strategy is fairly simple - they _kill the men_, and scare the shit out of the women and children. That gendered aspect is integral to what they're doing. And yet, if you were to read media reports, it is as if the killing is indiscriminate, and against 'people'.

Consent. \n\nTrust is very important for mental healthcare, for men and women. 55% [of men who dropped out of therapy](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1177\/15579883211014776) felt no connection with the therapist and 20% said the therapy lacked progress. \n\nIt's a lot easier to treat people when they trust the people who are meant to care about them, and a lot of mental healthcare professionals don't care about men. A lot of men have been burnt badly. A lot of them have been burned by family and friends who lied to them about what they wanted and then punished them when they did the wrong thing or expressed the wrong emotion.\n\nI know from personal experience and that of friends that therapy and the supposed support of friends is actually terrible when you go through it, and the standard things that people push just don't work for many. \n\nIn come many feminists and their supporters, explaining how the issue is masculinity making men unwilling to open up and talk about their emotions. \n\n\/u\/kimba93 said [this](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/11nwmi3\/would_you_agree_with_the_following_narrative_men\/)\n\n>Because while it is obviously good to talk more about your feelings, facing the responsibility and accountability that comes with it - being called an emotional soyboy, being taken less serious in many instances, risking to open up to someone who will use a weakness against you, etc. - is a price not worth paying for most men.\n\n\/u\/Kubikistar said [this](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/11nyxwr\/why_male_tears_pushes_are_bad\/jbtrcef\/?context=3)\n\n>It's okay for men to cry. It's healthy sometimes to let out that emotion and bottle it up sometimes, and men shouldn't feel that they cannot cry or show emotional vulnerability in similar ways. We'd all be better off if men just generally felt more free to show emotional vulnerability like this. (Attitude 2) is regressive and just puts needless restrictions on men based on their gender and pushes men to be out-of-touch with their own emotions.\n\n\/u\/Mitoza had [this to say](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/11nyxwr\/why_male_tears_pushes_are_bad\/jbwndkt\/)\n\n>No, I'm apologizing to you for making you feel submissive. I didn't realize I was dealing with this level of fragility.\n\nThe common thread for a lot of these ideas is people saying what is morally good, what is responsible, what is healthy, and telling men why they should obey them. This means no need to ask men questions, no need to ask them what they need. It means simply telling men what they need to do to be healthy, regardless of how they feel. \n\nIt also means there's no burden on people to change for men. If all the responsibility for mental healthcare is on men, why change anything?\n\nThe proper response is to respect the consent of men. Men have been burnt repeatedly by those who claimed to be helping them. If you want to help men, you need to be better at listening, talk to men more, and ask them what they want. If men aren't buying what you're selling, that's not because they're just too stupid to see how your ideas are great- often it's because they correctly feel it won't work for them.\n\nBe better for men, do more for men. Don't demand they do all the work for you. Get men to consent to treatment by making better treatment, and offer a variety of treatments to see what works. That means less moralizing and more hard work trying to help men.","title":"The missing word from discussions on male tears- consent.

The Office of Civil Rights' objections center around the lack of examples of men being denied entry into the programs, as well as their policies that men are officially included. But the trio argues that programs with names and purposes such as the \"Women's Empowerment Conference\" effectively discourage men from applying, which constitutes discrimination. They refer to supreme Court precedent in *Teamsters v United States*:\n\n>If an employer should announce his policy of discrimination by a sign reading \"Whites Only\" on the hiring-office door, his victims would not be limited to the few who ignored the sign and subjected themselves to personal rebuffs. The same message can be communicated to potential applicants more subtly but just as clearly by an employer's actual practices\u2014by his consistent discriminatory treatment of actual applicants, by the manner in which he publicizes vacancies, his recruitment techniques, his responses to casual or tentative inquiries, and even by the racial or ethnic composition of that part of his work force from which he has discriminatorily excluded members of minority groups.\n\nWhat do you think of their argument? One might wonder why it focuses so narrowly on group membership, rather than arguing that a group's gendered purpose itself constitutes gender discrimination.

On the other hand, the latest research from the U.S. contradicts the view that women are still perceived as less competent leaders (and to some extent even suggests the opposite):\n\nIn the Pew Research article [WOMEN AND LEADERSHIP 2018 \u2014 2. Views on leadership traits and competencies and how they intersect with genders (Horowitz et al., 2018)](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2018\/09\/20\/2-views-on-leadership-traits-and-competencies-and-how-they-intersect-with-gender\/), the authors show that \"majority of adults say male and female leaders have different leadership styles, relatively few think one gender has a better overall approach than the other\" even though \"those who do see a difference between male and female leaders across a range of leadership traits and behaviors perceive women to be stronger in most areas, both in politics and business\". Specifically, \"\\[f\\]emale leaders seen as more compassionate, empathetic than men\" and **\"\\[i\\]n politics, women are much more likely than men to be viewed as better role models; in business more see them as better able to create a safe and respectful workplace\"**.\n\nThe research article [Stereotypes have changed over time and now more people think women are superior to men than the other way around. (Eagly et al., 2019)](https:\/\/www.apa.org\/pubs\/journals\/releases\/amp-amp0000494.pdf) is a meta-analysis of 16 national U.S. opinion polls on gender stereotypes (N = 30,093 adults) extending from 1946 to 2018. Traits measured were communion (e.g., affectionate, emotional), agency (e.g., ambitious, courageous), and competence (e.g., intelligent, creative). Respondents indicated whether each trait is more true of women or men, or equally true of both. The authors found that \"respondents now ascribe competence in general and intelligence more often to women than men, regardless of college education and birth cohort\". Women were also thought of as more communal. The only trait in which men were perceived to be higher than women was agency. \"**Contemporary gender stereotypes thus convey substantial female advantage** in communion and a smaller male advantage in agency but also gender equality in competence along with some female advantage.\" See also this [APA article \"Women Now Seen as Equally as or More Competent Than Men\"](https:\/\/www.apa.org\/news\/press\/releases\/2019\/07\/women-equally-more-competent).\n\nIt might even be that women are evaluated _more positively_ than men, because people fear hurting their feelings: In [Gendered White Lies: Women Are Given Inflated Performance Feedback Compared With Men (Zayas & Jampol, 2020)](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0146167220916622) the authors show that **people are more likely to assume that manager's feedback towards women is less accurate and upwardly distorted**, that participants adjust their essay ratings upwards when giving feedback to females, and that women do not prefer this 'nicer' but less accurate performance rating. The reason for this might be that **because people have more compassion for women, it increases their likelihood of lying**. In [Lying because we care: Compassion increases prosocial lying (Lupoli & Jampol, 2017)](https:\/\/doi.apa.org\/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000315) it is shown that the emotion of compassion causally increases and positively predicts prosocial lying and that this was partially motivated by enhanced importance placed on preventing emotional harm.\n\n> But those benefits^(1) have come with a price.

What should [a male domestic abuse victim with a female perpetrator](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eufuJkjxk28) do if he is not able to call the police because it will make his life even worse as he has to fear being viewed as the perpetrator [and being arrested instead](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20211227123343\/https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/uknews\/crime\/12061547\/How-male-victims-of-domestic-abuse-often-end-up-getting-arrested-themselves.html) (in fact, [male victims are more likely to be arrested than their female abusers](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3175099\/))? What about feminist academic Marry Koss actively hiding the extent of rape committed by women against men which lead to countless male victims not finding their justice?\n\n**(3)** How do men as a class exploit women? Is it not exploitation that men on average work longer hours in more dangerous jobs, yet receive less in tax benefits, do less consumer spending and receive less money for health initiatives?\n\n> Most men find it difficult to be patriarchs. Most men are disturbed by hatred and fear of women, by male violence against women, even the men who perpetuate this violence.\n\nIf most men are disturbed by hatred and fear of women, then why do multiple researchers find (often contrary to their own expectation) that both men and women view women more positively than men? For example: In [Gender Differences in Automatic In-Group Bias: Why Do Women Like Women More Than Men Like Men? (Rudman & Goodwin, 2004)](https:\/\/doi.apa.org\/record\/2004-19340-007) the authors show that women have strong automatic in-group preferences, i.e. favoring their own sex, whereas men lack such a mechanism and instead also favor women. Women were 4.5 times as likely to show an automatic preference for their own gender than men were to show such favoritism for their own gender. **Both male and female participants associated positive words such as 'good', 'happy' and 'sunshine' more often with women than with men, both men and women implicitly favored their mothers, and men showed low pro-male gender attitudes.** Only women but not men showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender.\n\nIf men fear women, then why does research consistently find that both men and women fear men more, such as [Men fear other men most: gender specific brain activations in perceiving threat from dynamic faces and bodies \u2013 an fMRI study (Kret et al., 2011)](https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2011.00003\/full)?\n\n> But they fear letting go of the benefits. They are not certain what will happen to the world they know most intimately if patriarchy changes. So they find it easier to passively support male domination even when they know in their minds and hearts that it is wrong.\n\nAgain, what benefits are we talking about? How do men \"passively support male domination\"? Do women not passively (or rather, actively) support gynocentrism by [canceling their membership after not getting preferential treatment for being a woman](https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-10421995\/Fury-AA-says-NOT-help-lone-woman-man-roadside.html) and [getting the company to backpedal](https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-60075906) and say that women are a priority and changing their original position of being about equality?\n\n> Again and again men tell me they have no idea what it is feminists want. I believe them. I believe in their capacity to change and grow. And I believe that if they knew more about feminism they would no longer fear it, for they would find in feminist movement the hope of their own release from the bondage of patriarchy.\n\nIf men found out about the [Duluth model](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/rout0h\/rebuttals_to_claims_made_about_the_duluth_model\/), or that a [Swedish gender equality authority wants to classify women beating women and women beating men as \"men's violence against women\"](https:\/\/kvartal-se.translate.goog\/artiklar\/jamstalldhetsmyndigheten-kvinnors-vald-mot-man-ar-en-del-av-mans-vald-mot-kvinnor\/?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp), or that [feminist professor Mary Koss is responsible for excluding male rape victims from the definition of rape](https:\/\/recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com\/post\/119784319421\/influential-rape-researcher-mary-koss-claims-male), or that a feminist professor [preached to her class about castrating boys at birth](https:\/\/nationalfile.com\/teacher-boys-need-to-be-castrated-at-birth\/), or [that feminists used a 'containment strategy' to hide the extremely high prevalence of domestic violence perpetrated by women](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2790940), or that a [feminist march features Donna Hylton who crushed a man's testicles with a pair of pliers, beat him, burned him, starved him and sexually assaulted\/raped him while detaining him for 15 to 20 days](https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/news\/2017\/01\/30\/donna-hylton-background\/) and other shenanigans that feminists were (and still are) up to, they WOULD start to fear it.\n\n> \\[People\\] assume that men are the sole teachers of patriarchal thinking. Yet many female-headed households endorse and promote patriarchal thinking with far greater passion than two-parent households\n\nWhat type of patriarchal thinking are we talking about? Since this thinking is called 'patriarchal', what net benefits does it grant men?\n\n> patriarchy as a system has denied males access to full emotional well-being, which is not the same as feeling rewarded, successful, or powerful because of one\u2019s capacity to assert control over others. To truly address male pain and male crisis we must as a nation be willing to expose the harsh reality that patriarchy has damaged men in the past and continues to damage them in the present.\n\n_How_ has patriarchy denied men \"access to full emotional well-being\" and why does patriarchy necessitate men to do this? What mechanisms are at play here? Not that I don't understand this perspective, but I would object that the origins do not lie in a male desire for dominance over women, but in a societal inclination in both men and women to shelter women from harm and provide for them. Under this view, the patriarchy is not the cause of harm done to men and women, but instead a consequence of arranging gendered responsibilities in a way maximally conducive to childbearing and raising and achieving maximal fitness of one's offspring (according to the potentially outdated parameters calibrated through billions of years of evolution) and by extension, the needs of women (gynocentrism). This gynocentric orientation lies at the heart of men being denied emotional well-being since a corollary of this attitude is that women receive relatively more empathy than do men (i.e., the gender empathy gap). And this gynocentric orientation is not a conspiracy of women to oppress men (in the way 'patriarchy' is often used by feminists, including Bell Hooks), but an empirically verified \"set of psychosocial proclivities, in both sexes, which promote preferencing of women and hence, inevitably, the disadvantaging of men\" ([William Collins](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Empathy-Gap-Disadvantages-Mechanisms-Neglect\/dp\/0957168888)).\n\nNow, I do not disagree that there is a societal construct that could be dubbed 'patriarchy'. The societal tendency of men to be represented at the highest ranks _could_ be called 'patriarchy' (and I would call it so). Additionally, I contend, patriarchy is a consequence of the gynocentric mindset, a tool to enforce that women are protected and provided for to maximize the number of women that get to reproduce and to filter out deleterious mutations by making men with 'good' genes more visible through their rank in the male hierarchies and allowing women to select those men for reproduction. Gynocentrism precedes the patriarchy. A more apt naming that combines both of these two concepts is 'gynopatriarchy'.\n\nUnfortunately, feminists (including this one) frequently use 'patriarchy' in a [motte-and-bailey](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy) fashion: \"\\[motte-and-bailey is\\] an informal fallacy where an arguer conflates two positions that share similarities, one modest and easy to defend (the \"motte\") and one much more controversial (the \"bailey\"). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position. Upon retreating to the motte, the arguer can claim that the bailey has not been refuted (because the critic refused to attack the motte) or that the critic is unreasonable (by equating an attack on the bailey with an attack on the motte).\" In this context, the motte would be the position I just outlined, namely that there is a tendency for men to be relatively overrepresented compared to women in the highest ranks (and that there is a set of strict gender roles). The bailey would be that men as a class use their power to oppress women as a class.\n___\nLast but not least, one may take a look at this quillette.com article [The Myth of Pervasive Misogyny (Clark & Winegard, 2020)](https:\/\/quillette.com\/2020\/07\/27\/the-myth-of-pervasive-misogyny\/):\n> Ironically, these pro-female preferences may explain why mainstream narratives focus so assiduously on the possibility of anti-female biases: **society cares more about the wellbeing of women than men and is thus less tolerant of disparities that disfavor them**. \\[\u2026\\] The mainstream view is that we live in a sexist patriarchy that is persistently unfair toward women and privileges men in nearly all ways. And any claims to the contrary are treated as the protestations of benighted conservatives or other masculinist cranks. A Google Scholar search for misogyny yielded 114,000 results, whereas a search for misandry yielded only 2,340. We suspect this difference in interest in misogyny over misandry reflects not the relative prevalence of each type of prejudice, but rather greater concern for the wellbeing of women than men. **All

I do believe it is applied more against one gender than another but I didn't want to concentrate on that today. As a result, this post is going to be vague on purpose whilst giving my opinion. For the record, (whilst in some instances there is institutional barriers making gender important, and soci ways in which the two sexes are treated differently based on their sex - which aren't absolute, but patterns can be discerned) I think this is absolute bollocks. Ideas that fall under this category are:\n\nRape is a (preferred gender) issue\nViolence is a (preferred gender) issue\nChildren need their (preferred gender) parent\n(Preferred gender) have more power than (preferred gender)\n(Preferred gender) has unreasonable standards put on their sexuality\nMen\/women are treated like success\/sex objects\nMen\/women are treated with less empathy\/agency\nMen\/women are looking to replace their partners with a younger\/richer model\nSuicide is a (preferred gender issue\n\nI think you get where I am going with this. Now onto the arguments. There is the argument of which gender is perpetuating toxic behaviour (either inter-group or intra-group), but I find this irrelevant. Toxic people are as toxic people do. Most people, aren't. I believe the data is skewed and it is exceedingly difficult to come to definitive conclusions through social science (not that I think it isn't useful). People gravitate towards the studies that promote their biases. I'm sure I am no different in this, or will cherry pick the areas where their preferred guilty gender is clearly in the majority. The only way I can see this being relevant is if people genuinely believe one gender is inherently worse than the other. I think this approach is routed in sexism, there are disparities in behaviour but are perceptions may be flawed and those behaviours probably aren't reflective on any one gender as a whole (take psychopaths for example - fatally violent people tend to be men and most research puts women as the main perpetrators of relational aggression).\n\nTo blame any problem as a result of male\/female psyche is sexist. I believe this to be true whether people blame biology or socialisation for these behaviours. From my perspective any trait can be toxic taken to extremes and just because their are gendered patterns in traits it does not make the individuals responsible for the traits typically associated with their gender.\n\nPeople feeling powerless or pressured is a human issue. Genders may typically feel pressured for different reasons, but the ultimate feeling is the same. When people feel they're powerless\/ostracised they will often gravitate to the easiest ways in which they can achieve power\/status. This can manifest as violence, manipulation or all kinds of toxic behaviours.\n\nIssues like rape, violence and abuse can affect anyone for different reasons and I do think there is some cause to question whether domestic abuse\/rape is as one sided as people may think. If it is reciprocal then it is likely these toxic behaviours will feed into each other, and would mean that by only helping the gender we \"think\" is the most affected we  will not be working toward an effective solution. For instance, by punishing one gender (or as I would prefer support and rehabilitation) over another we will ultimately be giving a lot of people no recourse for when they are the victim. They will be isolated and should they decide to retaliate will be to blame. Meaning that we would be hurting a victim and supporting an abuser. To me, this does not seem like it will help.\n\nIn other words, by concentrating on the **human** condition and each issues individually we will be opening up the debate to more effective measures of problem solving that would be of benefit to the whole of society. If we are so focused on one gender \"winning\" we may very well be creating the conditions for a collective loss.\n\nAs to men\/women being more logical\/empathetic, I don't even believe this. Human emotion is notoriously difficult to measure. Whilst I do believe people can express these traits in different ways (and I think there is gendered patterns) I do think people generally look at these traits with a lack of nuance. Is someone who includes human emotion in their appraisal of situations being less logical or is it only logical that we include human emotion as part of our deliberations as it is a constant presence in our world? Is the parent who enforces strict boundaries being less empathetic to enforce those when their child is having a bad day, or are they possibly doing what they think is best for the child. Helping them to focus on responsibilities and (arguably) giving them the tools to stand up to adversity in a healthy and positive manner. Arguments like this are often used to determine which parent is more beneficial for a child but what if a healthy developing child needs both? What if a child needs the logic of how to navigate strenuous situations and needs someone to give them a break now and then. To encourage **both** responsibility and expressiveness in terms of emotions?\n\nI could go on and on about my list above, but I won't. This just forms the basis of my overall opinion... When we put down other people's points of view for not being about the *right* gender even if it is relevant to the topic are we not just limiting our own capacity for understanding. Sometimes, things don't need to be gendered. Sometimes multiple points of view are necessary to discern the truth and to develop mutual respect and understanding. If we something is a (preferred gender) space for a non-gendered issue, we are just arbitrarily deciding which victims are valid based on what they have between their legs.\n\nFor instance, is a man's opinion - who is raped by a woman  invalid when it comes to the issue of rape invalid just because he might be in the minority. Or might he have unique insight that would otherwise be lost because it has been decided that rape is a woman's issue. Is a woman's opinion (who is falsely accused of rape) invalid (even though I think courts are biased against men - what if this woman pissed off someone powerful, what if this woman happens to be ostracised and hated by her peers)?\n\nWhy then is it so evil to bring multiple perspectives into the fold? Why must we draw such rigid lines in the sand? What is so offensive about people offering up their perspectives on issues where our answers are limited and deciding who can and can't speak based off of potential misconceptions? They are not necessarily detracting from (preferred gender)'s issues by bringing up their opinions, they may very well be adding to it. Then the only reason we'd be silencing them is because we don't like what they have to say.","title":"This is a sub for Men's\/Women's Issues - To Bring Up Women\/Men Here is Derailing the Conversation...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/glhhh5\/this_is_a_sub_for_menswomens_issues_to_bring_up\/","upvote_ratio":0.94,"over_18":false}

I make no guarantees when it comes to quality, but will strive to make it as high as possible, as I intend to revisit these notes come the exam period. I'll also attempt to present the information presented in the course and the material, and leave out opposing information I believe I have access to, if I did not share it with the rest of the course.\n\nFirst, quick information about the course. It is explicitly made with a Nordic perspective, and carries clear influence of this. Additionally, it is meant to be a critical course, with an understanding of academic work as intent on influencing society. Finally, it focuses on a sociocultural approach, taking primary inspiration from the social sciences and the humanities.\n\nAs an opening to the course, this lecture focused mostly on the historical development of the perspectives on sex and gender, and a brief introduction to most perspectives. While it did not define any lens that is the right one, it was helpful in deciding on one that is wrong. We proceed to biological determinism\n\nFirst, the lecturer did grant that biological sex is a thing, and that it causes certain differences between men and women. Among these differences were: Genitals, different on a rather essential level, serving different functions and the like; differences in anatomy, physiology, and hormones, which are relatively small and nearly all biologists agree about that. Furthermore, the small sex differences in biology are not big enough to offer a valid explanation of societal differences between the genders. \n\nBiological determinism was seen to rise out of the inception of the two-sex model. This segment takes Thomas Laqueur's book \"Making Sex\" as the primary source. In it, a history of views on sex is detailed. Put briefly, for a while it followed the logic of a one-sex model, where men were men, and women were incomplete men, where the differences between men and women were in degree. On the other hand, coming around with biology and anatomy research, a dichotomy of the sexes as different in essence came around. This difference was seen as an absolute, and separated the sexes with little to no acknowledgement of overlap. This information was used to discriminate based on sex, fueling such arguments as different voting rights, or different pay. \n\nWhen asked whether the fault in this lay with the underlying facts, or the reasoning that accompanied them, the lecturer called it a good question. It was extrapolated upon that the reasoning was not necessarily wrong, different lengths in parental leave being brought up as a reasonable way to discriminate based on biological facts. On the other hand, it was acknowledged that it depends on whether one were to identify as a \"liberal\" or a \"radical\" on the matter of equality, where the former would be more prone to want equal treatment, and the latter more likely to condone differential treatment.\n\nThen we asked the question of what defines sex. What counts, who decides, and when\/where is biological sex important? Intersex examples were offered to outline the blurring of the line, the ethics of sex conforming surgeries on intersex infants was questioned. Hormones and chromosomes were offered as possible measurements of what biological sex is. As for when it is important, reproduction was a clear example, while sports was mentioned, and the lecturer offered that one might find some other metrics than genitalia to sort people in categories that might be just as fair for the competitors. Affirmative action was also mentioned, where a counter that it regards social gender, was offered.\n\nThe matter of gendering items was also discussed, where the students were prompted to find different items that were gendered, and discuss how they were gendered, and why. This takes inspiration from [this](https:\/\/research.utwente.nl\/en\/publications\/on-gender-and-things-reflections-on-an-exhibition-on-gendered-art) research, featuring a broad set of household items, and how they have been gendered. The example I will bring up is an electric screwdriver versus an electric whisk. Where the purpose of both is to make things spin, they tend to be different in design. More rounded lines, lighter colors, less accessibility to dismantle, and ease of operation were things described to be associated with gendering an item as feminine. Social commentary about how we in turn treat these items was offered. In this sense, designers were presented as ignorant as to what gender their product was getting, and unconscious bias was briefly mentioned, but not elaborated upon. I don't completely understand the offered perspective, but will try and dive deeper into it if anyone is interested in discussing the gender of things.\n\nThe matter of social gender was next up. With the defined areas being gender role, gender identity, gender relations, gender in relation to society, and gendered language. The main argument seemed to be that sex and\/or gender inform all of these, who in turn affect gender.\n\nAfter this primer, the course proceeded to extrapolate on how the different understandings of gender were created. We have the biological-medical perspective, which has been extrapolated on, and will not be very relevant going forward. Then we have sociocultural perspectives, and critical perspectives, forming the main categories that will be brought forward into the course.\n\nMargaret Mead, an anthropologist and the author of \"Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive societies\" (1935) was used as an example of a sociocultural perspective, representing anthropological and ethnographic studies of gender which challenged biological understandings. The research is an example of criticism against understandings of gender based on white, western culture. Outlining three societies living on a single island, with widely different gender expressions, it was used as activist research, prompting the quote: \"if the characteristics we consider as feminine can easily be considered as masculine in other cultures, there is no ground for linking these characteristics to the biological sex.\" On this note, the book does briefly acknowledge that her research has been criticized for being overly simplistic, stating she did it to clarify her arguments in relation to the American society. It (the book, not the lecture) concludes that even though her overarching points underline cultural organization of gender, and are correct, her handling of details in research shows that the relationship between activism and science at times can be strained.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir, with her book \"the second sex\" (1949), forms a representation of gender seen from the humanities. And Toril Moi, with her interpretations and critique of Beauvoir was brought up in the same category. In this case, it was described that Simone described society as she saw it, with gender roles put on women, and being something that was learned. While transcendence was something she considered tied to the masculine, she argued that the immanence of women was a necessary contrast in the dominant system. Transcendence in this sense refers to a certain accessibility of the future, and freedom of action, while immanence is the lack of awareness of free choice brought on due to oppression.\n\nOur ending note is on Judith Butler with Gender Trouble (1990), whose attributed view is that sex is as much a product of social construction as gender. A central theory is centered around performance. Where one performs gender in ones daily life, and thereby reproduce the social norms connected to that gender. An additional note is that she doesn't consider gender to be something one is, but rather something you do, act like, and look like. Her view of gender comes across more as if it was a tradition, where stepping too far outside ones gender causes social sanctions, and seemingly arguing that \"misquoting\" ones performance of gender serves as a way to change gender. Strikes me as very \"be the change you want to see in the world.\" \n\nNext week, we will look at feminism and gender studies, the former being another category of lenses to view gender through. I have noticed that I haven't been able to get everything down, but this was a four hour course, and a couple more hours of comparing notes, literature, and the slides. I'll try and see if I can produce a more accurate transcript to work with next time. I'll also, happily accept comments on the format. Could be that I should use bullet-points, and extrapolate on the most interesting bits in the comments upon request.","title":"Week one: A song of Sex and Gender.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/ct4441\/week_one_a_song_of_sex_and_gender\/","upvote_ratio":0.97,"over_18":false}

It also raises a lot of valid points in terms of demographics that we can make inferences from. \n\n>The mortality rate for working class white men, between the ages of 45 and 54 had been steadily rising since 1999.\n\n>white, middle-aged men account for 70% of deaths from suicide each year. Nine-tenths of them are from a lower socioeconomic class.  \n\n>Veterans are often one of the largest segments within this group. According to a 2014 Veterans Affairs (VA) report, 20 commit suicide each day. 65% of them are age 50 or older.\n\n>A larger segment of this group has chosen the slow suicide route. Many are succumbing to things like alcohol liver disease or a drug overdose.\n\nSo we aren't just talking about any American white men. This is specifically bad for middle aged white men who are poor or working class. Even more so if you have served in the military. There are some kind of obvious things that jump out at me here, first of all is divorce. Men in that age range are far more likely to get a divorce, the article even mentions this. But you won't see any mention of the different troubles divorce men and divorced women go though, you won't see any mention of family courts. I think this is the primary reason more men commit suicide after divorce. The article instead offers this\n\n>Whether married or single, women tend to open up to friends and family about their troubles and build a strong network of support. Whereas men generally don\u2019t. If they open up at all, it\u2019s usually to their partner. But for the divorced or single, there\u2019s no such outlet. \n\nWhich doesn't address the different problems they are facing but instead their reaction to it. They imply that a single guy who has to split his income evenly between paying bills and child support don't have the will to find a support network, where as women who are involved with their kids schooling, friends parents, hobby groups just try harder. I think this completely discounts the different situations they are placed in, but that is just the beginning. I think we should talk about other reasons why guys don't open up. Big think gives us this\n\n>Hegemonic masculinity, according to Meyer, is the idea that one\u2019s machismo must be broadcast constantly, no matter what he is dealing with or how he feels inside. It\u2019s stoicism taken to the nth degree. Several studies have found that hegemonic masculinity is detrimental to men\u2019s well-being and health outcomes, including Sabo & Gordon, 1995; Courtenay, 2000; and Lee & Owens, 2002.\n\nWhich honestly I can appreciate to a point. I do believe that men and women have different ways of dealing with emotional stress, so expecting them to open up in the same way as women would be foolish. But we should be listening and helping. However the article isn't particularly interested in doing this, as it already knows the issue, secret white supremacy. \n\n>Caucasian men have enjoyed white hegemony in the US. That\u2019s changing. As the \u201cBrowning of America\u201d takes shape, whites will become a minority, projected to take place by 2045. Although this may usher in more social equality, the loss of a given-at-birth superiority will chafe a certain segment of the Caucasian community.\n\nThis part actually makes me kind of angry, did we not just say that the vast majority of these guys were lower income? Anyway men should open up more, but white people should just get over their privilege. How does that work for a white man exactly? I mean if it's just a result of the world getting more equal, why would it be a problem. The article gets closer to an answer than I would have expected. \n\n>In most cases, men are suffering from an eroded sense of self and identity.\n\nI would say this is not just true for men, but white men especially. When was the last time you tried talking about how proud you were to be a white male without flagellating yourself and how did it go for you? And this is kind of the point where it all comes together. If you are born privileged and only complaining because things are becoming more equal, people are going to care a lot less about your problems, even if they involve not seeing your kids anymore. And if you are constantly busy working a low end job to try and pay for both child support costs and rising costs of living, you aren't going to have a lot of time to find the people who might care. So instead people drink and into despair and depression. \n\nSo how do we fix this mess big think?\n\n>One way to overcome this, is to update our definition of masculinity for the 21st century. Another would be to build a more gender neutral society, where everyone is looked upon on an individual basis, despite their gender\n\nNote they make no issue of the race aspect, just the gendered one. But generally I agree, I'm just not sure they understand what it would mean. Firstly you might have to fix the family court system that has been using men's traditional role as provider to screw them over. Secondly you might have to open up to men and listen, instead of telling them how they need to. And lastly you need to stop fearing the white and male identity. Lower income white males aren't privileged and their problems can be caused by injustice (possibly even caused by their race and\/or gender). \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the article and more importantly the issue at large? Would you rather change conceptions of masculinity or judge people as individuals despite their gender? Why is it so difficult to acknowledge the unique intersection of problems that white men face, instead of focusing always on their reaction to those problems?\n\n","title":"Today, being white and male are the two single greatest risk factors for suicide in the US, why?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/6s2jum\/today_being_white_and_male_are_the_two_single\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

By policy of the university(maybe law?) he reported this to Title IX office, although he would have reported it regardless of the law as I would have wanted him to. I was soon contact by a lawyer from the Title IX office. This man was a practicing attorney, but he acted in an investigatory role for the university. He investigated the event from a preponderance of evidence perspective(i.e. more likely than not). My attacker admitted to the assault, so he was given an order not to contact me and put on probation for the university. I believe it would have gone to a council of some sort if my attacker had denied the allegations.\n\n\n\nThat lawyer walked me down to the police station to report the crime in that capacity. He left me in the hands of a capable beat cop with whom I sat and told my story. He immediately went to his sergeant and his sergeant brought in a team of detectives to talk to me. The process was very efficient, and the officers were very supportive. I should say that the beat cop was very supportive and said I was doing the right thing, which i appreciated, but the detectives had a more objective but still considerate perspective which I understood and respected. I was interviewed, which was videotaped, and then I signed a sworn statement affirming that what I was telling them was true. A couple of days later my attacker was interviewed by the police.\n\n\n\n\nHe refused his right to counsel, which was not his best move. He admitted to the crime in a sworn statement which pretty much sealed his guilt. After that he lawyered up and decided to fight it. His lawyer delayed for several months, presumably not wanting to admit to her client that he had no case. Unfortunately their delaying tactics worked. I am planning on moving out west next month and I wanted the case resolved so I didn't have to fly back for a trial at the very start of my career. So the prosecute consulted me and then offered a plea deal to my attacker the terms of which he approved with me.\n\n\n\nSo in the end he is going to jail for half a month, has a sizable fine, probation, and he can never talk to me again. I was very satisfied by this portion of the outcome. However, the shame I feel from my peers is still quite great. This might be because I am a man, but I have no way of knowing that for sure. I hope when I get into the working world and as I get older people will be more supportive of things like this.\n\n\n\n\nI've talked about this a few times on this forum, so I thought I would conclude the story now that it is at an end.

They are not insulting, so I don't think I'm in breach of the rules. I'm not claiming that this is a new idea, just trying to summarise it as briefly as possible. I would love to see a valid (positivist) counterargument.\n\nPrivilege = an overwhelming accumulation of unearned advantages based on some characteristic.\n\n**Feminist assumption**\n\nMen (as a class\/on average) have privilege because they have an accumulation of unearned advantages. Women do not have privilege, because they do not possess such advantages.\n\n**Non-feminist counterargument**\n\nLooking at the available evidence, women (as a class\/on average) do appear to have a substantial number of unearned advantages, therefore women also have privilege. Gender privilege is dynamic, rather than unidirectional.\n\n**Feminist response**\n\nThese unearned advantages possessed by women are by-products of male privilege e.g. \"longer prison sentences for men happen because women are infantilised\", and therefore constitute further evidence of male privilege.\n\n**Non-feminist objection** \n\nThis argument affirms the consequent and is therefore logically circular. \n\nMore generally, it resembles e.g. the fundamentalist Christian assertion that \"fossils are proof of god because he put them there to test our faith\". This is a hallmark of an unfalsifiable belief i.e. one which is immune to empirical scrutiny.\n\n**Summary**\n\nSome feminists claim that women's unearned advantages do not constitute privilege, because only men have privilege... But this is inconsistent if privilege is granted by unearned advantages, which women also possess in large number.\n\nThe circularity comes in the *objection* to arguments against the concept of one-directional male privilege. The idea of male privilege itself is unfalsifiable.\n\n**Circular logic: quick comparison**\n\nMen have privilege because they have unearned advantages <---> Men have unearned advantages because they are privileged\n\nThe Bible is inerrant because it is the word of God <---> The word of God is inerrant because it says so in The Bible","title":"The unfalsifiability of male privilege - a succinct summary","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/5wwnbq\/the_unfalsifiability_of_male_privilege_a_succinct\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

I'm not referring to popularity here but rather I'm referring to it's expansiveness and depth. True understanding of feminism requires reading hundreds of papers, dozens or even hundreds of books, many studies, developing a wide and specialized vocabulary, extensive knowledge of history and following pop culture. Quite frankly, it requires a PhD. Even that's a severe understatement because most people who get a PhD in a field like Women's Studies will not be taken seriously. They will not get jobs in academia, will not make successful publications, will influence no one, and will be lucky to get a job as an adjunct who earns less than minimum wage for doing 70+ hours  of work per week. \n\nThere are many many people who look at feminism and know in their heart of hearts that it's really just not for them. They hear things about patriarchy, they hear terms like rape culture, and so on. They know from the get-go that nothing in this paradigm speaks for them, their experiences, their personality, or their prior knowledge. Of these people, many try to speak out against it. When you try to speak out about it, you get hit with a treadmill. Any generalization you make about it will be met with some counterexample, even if obscure (obscure itself is difficult to define because different positions are obscure to different people). Some feminist will not think there's a patriarchy. Some feminist will not think men oppress women. Some feminist will even be against equality. \n\nWhen they hear of all these different feminisms, none of them sound right to them. They pick a position and try to critique it but every single feminism has so damn much behind it that you need a PhD to address any one of them. \"Did you read this book?\" \"What do you think about this academic from the 1970s? btw, to understand them you should probably read these 12 who came before her.\" What a lot of these anti-feminists want to do is say: \"Look, this shit I see, maybe the laws passed, the shit said to me by feminists, etc.... hits me in this way, here's why I disagree, and here's the phenomenon that I want to discuss and why I don't think it can possibly be consistent with what I'm seeing.\" \n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that positions held by reasonable people, that are well thought out, and meaningful are inexpressible due to very practical constraints that emerge out of the way discussion channels are structured.\n\nOf course, that phenomenon doesn't really intersect with any coherently stated and 'properly understood' feminist position. How could it? Maybe you've done your best to be responsible, read a few books, talked to some feminists, or even talked to professors. Maybe you used to be a feminist. One thing's for sure though, you don't have a PhD. Without that specific connection, that you're not even sure how to go about making, your ideas can't fit within a proper academic discussion. Consequently, your ideas (and with them your experiences, knowledge, etc,) are diminished at best because if a proper forum even exists, you can't enter it. \n\nEntering that forum in a serious way takes some serious commitment. You legitimately do need to go to grad school and dedicate your life to critiquing feminism... but who's actually gonna do that? I'm an anti-feminist but I'm also a guy who wants to live my life, start a family, get a job, and so on. I'm not gonna enter the academy. The only people who would take the commitment, with few exceptions, are committed feminists! You only take that journey if feminism strikes you as irrevocably true and profound. Anyone else is gonna worry instead about their own thoughts, beliefs, and ideas that don't intersect with the academy. \n\nThe closest thing I know of to a historical analogue is when the Catholic church ran education. In order to be in a position to meaningfully discuss Christianity, you have to be chosen or approved by the church to get an education, learn to speak a different language, and master their paradigms. Naturally, only the uber religious got to discuss religion which lead to an intellectual monopoly on Christianity. I'm not saying feminists necessarily desire this, strive for this, or deliberately perpetuate this but it's absolutely a fact. Only the people willing to take that pledge are going to be given a voice in gender politics. The rest of us can do nothing but talk on the internet in whichever small or irrelevant forums allow it. \n\nHow are we supposed to be taken seriously in gender discussions?","title":"Nobody who would critique feminism, can critique feminism.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/3kemr2\/nobody_who_would_critique_feminism_can_critique\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

A woman was found guilty of forcing two boys, age 6 and 9, to perform oral sex on her, and was sentenced to only 15 months in prison. To compare, a man was recently sentenced to 60 years for having a consensual sexual relationship with a 15 year old girl (http:\/\/neshobademocrat.com\/main.asp?SectionID=2&SubSectionID=297&ArticleID=35265).\n\nI just don't get it. How can a woman forcibly rape a 6 year old boy and get less than 2 years in prison, but a man can have consensual sex with a 15 year old girl and get 60 years? And if you see stories about women having sex with 15-16 year old boys, they almost without a doubt will get off with probation or less than a month in jail. It has to be a 6 year old, and it has to be forced, for her to even get a year. Yet a man gets 20-60 for something way less serious.\n\nI find it hard to believe, in this case, that people think the 6 year old was \"lucky\" or \"wanted it\". So why, then, does this happen? Do we just not care what happens to boys? Are we just unable to sentence a woman to prison? I don't get it. \n\nThis is one of the few issues that really upsets me. It makes me feel like we, as a society, don't care about our boys at all and can't even get past our aversion to punishing women to protect boys from rape. I may be misguided here, but it feels to me like we're saying that it's better to have boys being molested and raped than it is to have female pedophiles in prison. But, of course, when the genders are reversed we see the girls as precious and have no qualms putting the men away for a long time to protect them.\n\nI just wish people would care about this more.

Shes a good dog, but since she is going to be an enormous dog I have to train her well to keep her from wrecking the place. So, I headed over to the smart, smart people at \/r\/dogtraining and started reading. They seriously know their dogs over there, I started using their tricks and her behavior improved by leaps and bounds (and not just because she wasn't leaping and bounding at me anymore!). \n\nOne thing they make sure to emphasize is \"positive reinforcement\". It goes like this: When my dog does anything I want her to do, I give her cookies and love, every time she does it. Sits down? Cookie! Doesn't beg at the table? More cookie! Cookie cookie cookie. I'll even give her cookies for taking a nap during my favorite TV shows. I may be creating a cookie addict, but if she is being good all the time I'm happy AND she's happy.\n\nThe thing they are against is \"positive punishment\". This is the idea that whenever my dog does something I don't like, I punish her. Poop on my carpet? Whack! This theoretically will make the dog stop doing bad things, but doesn't work as well. After all, this requires them to learn 2 things: a behavior, and DONT DO IT. Positive reinforcement only makes them learn 1 thing: Do this! Punishment can also cause wierd fallout, like instead of training my dog not to poop on my carpet, it teaches her to just poop on the carpet in another room. After all, she doesn't get whacked if I don't see her poop, right? She also doesn't learn what she is supposed to do, only what she is supposed to not do, and is just wandering around hoping to not get whacked today. That doesn't sound like a happy life.\n\nAnyways, where was I going with this... right. Call Out Culture. This is positive punishment: You did something Bad, and must now be called out. Somebody said something sexist? Call them out! Made an appearance in that Hollaback video? Call them out! Misgendered somebody? Call them out! Discriminated against a black dude? Call them out! Seems like it should work, right? But this leaves us just wandering through life hoping to not get called out. Sometimes I'll behave, sometimes... I'll be right back, just gonna poop on the carpet in the other room and then make racist posts on Stormfront. Nobody will call me out there! I'll never go on Tumblr or Twitter, and now you have no power over me! BWAHAHA!\n\nAhem. Right. Now, I remember back in the day, reading things like \"Congrats, you weren't a sexist... what do you want, a feminist cookie?\" Now, just think about this for a minute. Here we found somebody doing the right thing, and we are punishing them. Just what on Earth are they going to do? Be sexist, get called out. Be not sexist, get called out. Just what are you training when you do this? Where is my dog gonna poop if I punish her for pooping inside AND outside? If I put a woman in my videogame and she gets beat up that's bad, but if I make it so she can't get beat up then she is just wallpaper, and if I make her weak then that's bad, but if I make her strong then I am just turning her into a man with tits... I guess my dog will just never poop, and we will never have women in videogames.\n\nSo what can we do? Here's my plan: Feminist Cookies. Yes, cookies. Every time you see somebody doing something right, reward them somehow. Give them a cookie, or a scratch behind the ear, or a pat on the butt. They would stop and think, \"Huh... I did something good, AND I got a cookie? I should do good things more!\" Reddit works on this idea with its upvotes. And we should do it all the time, not just as an aside while we complain about something else, like when we bring up Black Widow in the Avengers as a good female character, but only when pointing out how few good female characters are out there. I know we are rage and drama addicts and love to jump on somebody when they are wrong, but just make sure to also toss a cookie out there occasionally. Wander into the Skyrim mod community and say \"Thanks for not having the women in your screenshots be wearing battle-thongs.\" Pop by \/r\/mensrights and \/r\/feminism and find somebody to say \"Thanks for not punching a strawman today\".\n\nSince these will be feminist cookies, I propose that these cookies should look like something suitably female.

The element of a not wanting, a lack of desire, is used to justify the false allegation of rape. But the complainant is still aware of the fact that she was not raped and consented to the sexual encounter. Lay people tend to associate rape with not wanting. De Zutter, Horselenberg, and van Koppen (2017) conducted a quasi-experiment in which they asked 35 women to fabricate rape and file a false allegation. They found that the fabricated stories of rape, the false allegations, resembled unwanted sex. Studies on fabricated rape have consistently shown that lay people tend to associate not wanting sex with rape (De Zutter, Horselenberg, & van Koppen, 2016; De Zutter et al., 2017). Thus, if a complainant recounts her unwanted consensual sexual encounter to friends and family, her social environment will react with the label of rape. Once the consensual sexual encounter is labeled rape by the environment, it creates a proverbial point of no return in the head of the complainant who decides to file a false allegation of rape at the police station instead of confronting her social environment with the assertion that their label is invalid (Veraart, 1997, 2006). Sometimes scholars have been said to engage in the process of relabeling consensual sexual encounters as rape. Sommers (1995) argued in her book \u201cWho Stole Feminism?\u201d that relabeling by scholars caused an inflation of the prevalence rates of rape reported by some scholars in the USA, because only one in four women who were labeled victims of rape by scientists in these studies believed that they were, in fact, raped.\n\nThe conclusion of the study does a good job of describing the various reasons for false rape allegations.  I didn't notice if it delineated between accusations against a particular person or general allegations that they were raped by an unknown offender.  For instance, I would think a lot of 'alibi' rapes don't name an assailant.  But, those are also harmful especially if a particular race is scapegoated.","title":"Motives for Filing a False Allegation of Rape","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/f14eaq\/motives_for_filing_a_false_allegation_of_rape\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

This approach most likely reflects the global pervasiveness of men\u2019s sexual violence and perceptions of women as sexually passive\"\n\nYet then also states:\n\n\"However, females also sexually aggress against unwilling partners (Erulkar, [2004](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10508-019-01538-4?shared-article-renderer#ref-CR16); Hines, [2007](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10508-019-01538-4?shared-article-renderer#ref-CR25)) and researchers have increasingly acknowledged nuances in how this might be expressed (e.g., by harassment, abuse, and coercion) (Grayston & De Luca, [1999](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10508-019-01538-4?shared-article-renderer#ref-CR22); M\u00e9nard, Hall, Phung, Ghebrial, & Martin, [2003](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10508-019-01538-4?shared-article-renderer#ref-CR41)). Despite this, and the negative physical and psychological consequences experienced by male victims (Visser, Smith, Rissel, Richters, & Grulich, [2003](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10508-019-01538-4?shared-article-renderer#ref-CR67)), a dominant gendered perspective has resulted in a relative paucity of information on factors that may explain female sexual aggression\"\n\nI find it funny that this study is still pushing the narrative of male aggressors. Is there data telling us that 35% of men have used physical force\/sexual coercion to get sex. The best I could find was [4%](https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamapediatrics\/article-abstract\/1748355). I'm not saying this one study is proof that women do it more, but it does suggest that it is more prevelant than our current approach may suggest. It is not like this is the **only** study that supports this idea \\[[1](https:\/\/ajph.aphapublications.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.2105\/AJPH.2014.301946)\\]\\[[2](https:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk\/33378\/3\/Fisher%20%2526%20Pina%20REVISED%20FV%20AVB%2010-05R.pdf)\\]\\[[3](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/1097184X08322632)\\]\\[[4](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/17691740\/The_unheard_victims?auto=download)\\]. I find it odd that Feminists state that men don't reveal their emotions due to patriarchy (debateable \\[[1](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/223564909_Gender_differences_in_stress_and_coping_styles)\\]\\[[2](https:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?hl=en&lr=&id=s14KOKLUsvUC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=stoicism&ots=Ah82nVM0z8&sig=YjbZqBapJS1-mw8YO6dqPGSiCA4#v=onepage&q=stoicism&f=false)\\], there are some societal pressures but these seem to stem from (general) differences anyway), but don't think it's valid to argue that men may hide their emotions more often, creating the differences in perception.\n\nAnother thing mentioned, which I am not sure I agree with is their focus on pornography. They determined that pornography consumption correlated with more aggressive sexual impulses, though I wonder if this is causational. To be it makes sense that sexual predators would have a higher sex drive and be more likely to consume porn. I see no causational research determining this.

If I were to have to choose between a gay, black, trans woman and a straight, white, cis man, I should look at who they are as a person. To do otherwise is to be discriminatory, however, using intersectionality in this case means that I'd almost certainly have to pick the woman, simply because her identity-group intersections are, again on a group-level, more oppressed than the man's are - but we don't actually know if those group-level generalizations are accurate to each individual's lived experience or not.\n\nWhile re-reading that, it occurred to me that people are using group-level associations and applying that to an individual which is the core of racist stereotypes.\n\nIn short, it appears to me that people are engaging in the same sorts of racism as '<out group> has a lower average IQ than <in group>' but then using that to make a claim about the assumed intellect of an individual of <out group>.\n\nWe don't know, for example, if an individual white person has experienced more or less oppression than a black individual, even while it's true of the whole.

We can see numerous examples of racism in history where a particular class of people is irrationally blamed for that society's problems.  The most obvious examples are those which are aimed at Jewish people; something that we can see even on reddit today.  Pseudoscience was often used to bolster these arguments.\n\nI think it is fair to call the use of the term 'patriarchy' in the NYT a parallel to that kind of bigotry.  We have a very clearly gendered term being used to describe an impossibly broad term that is blamed for an impossibly broad number of societal ills.  It paints men as if they are The Borg and somehow an insular community which works together to victimize women.  They even go so far as to describe \"the prime directive of the master\/slave relationship between women and men.\"\n\nEven with less grandiose language, the term is clearly intended to blame and disparage men and maleness throughout history and the present.  That is clearly a slur and a term of bigotry just like any other that attempts to associate some universal ill or negative with a particular class of people.\n\nDepending on how much interest there is in the post, I am going to wait a while to hopefully hear some different views on the subject before I start responding.  \n\nThank y'all.

We invite you to join us as we celebrate M.A.L.E. day! (Men Actively Leveraging Education) on November XX from 8 to 10:30 am. \n\n>\"Fathers (and mothers) are the first and primary teachers of children. Their active involvement in education has a positive influence on a child's learning.  In today's world, fatherhood comes in many different guises.  The term \"father\" is used broadly to describe men who are important in the life of a child.  This broader definition is in no way meant to undermine the importance of the role of the biological father in the life of a child.  Instead, it serves to highlight the positive impact that men (e.g. grandfathers, uncles, stepfathers, etc.) can have on young children. M.A.L.E. Day celebrates the roles of father-figures and the importance of their involvement on the education of young people!\n\n>\"We invite all father-figures and their children to meet us at X restaurant beginning at 8 am for coffee, juice and donuts.  At 8:15, 8:30 and 8:45 groups will walk* over to Y school to visit our \"Wild West: Saddle Up and Read\" book fair and make cards for our \"Holiday Mail for Heroes\" campaign.  Once the school day begins, father-figures will visit their child's classroom for a grade specific activity ending at 10:30 am.\"\n\n>*Transportation will be provided for those who are physically unable to walk.\n\nSo, number 1, I am in total favor of this, and *not* just because my daughter is massively excited to be able to bring a daddy *and* a grandpa *and* a brother (she clearly feels this is some sort of competition and she's winning it, lol) to it.  My husband joined the PTA (I'm allergic, so it's great that he wanted to) and he says, it's well over half female, and I suspect that's not unusual--so I'm happy to have efforts specifically aimed at increasing male involvement.  But in case anyone is curious, no, there is no F.E.M.A.L.E activity day provided--there's another morning during the school year where *all* parents are invited to come to school for a few hours with their child (called \"Bring Your Parents To School Day\") but women are not offered their own specific activity.  Does anyone find that problematic?  (I don't, but I thought it would be possible that someone else might.)\n\nNumber 2, it was hard not to notice that the day's activities are sort of \"male\"-themed--Wild West, \"Mail for Heroes.\"  Again, I'm totally cool with this--but does anyone else have different feelings?  Is stereotyping a problem here?  Or not?  \n\nNumber 3, how *would* this look if it were gender-reversed?  For example, I was thinking of this sentence, gender-reversed: \"The term 'mother' is used broadly to describe women who are important in the life of a child.\"  And that looks...odd to me.  It's not that the phenomenon never occurs--I know more than one person who had a woman who was not their mother take on the role of \"mother-figure\" in their life.  But...we don't actually use that phrase, habitually--\"mother-figure.\"  Not like we do \"father-figure.\" \n\nI had lots of thoughts about this, and I'm posting it just because I wondered if anybody else might...let me know yours, if you have any!

I think it's unacceptable to host a WOMEN'S World Championship in a place where women do not have basic fundamental rights and are treated as second-class citizens. For those saying that I don't know anything about Iran: I have received the most support and gratitude from the people of Iran, who are facing this situation every day. Thank you MyStealthyFreedom for sharing my interview. \n\nThe context is that she would be forced to wear a hijab to take part in the next world championship that is held in Iran.\n\nThe organizer also doesn't like the fact that she publicly criticised their practices, and there are more details in the above link.\n\nIn this link: http:\/\/archive.is\/7HjpL there is a counterargument by the Guardian, an often very slanted left\/far left, pro Islam newspaper which predictably doesn't like it. However there is a half decent argument there that a boycott might be detrimental to the women of Iran.\n\nI think legitimizing the idea that it is ok to be forced to wear the hijab and obey the rules of Islam is harmful for women everywhere. Especially, since Islam is the fasted growing religion of the world. http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2015\/04\/23\/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group\/\n\nWhich means it stands to become even more influential, even in the west.\n\nBut even as it currently stands, more Islamic countries might follow Iran's example, and the chess committee due to its precedent might be not reluctant to grant it.\n\nThis creates problems to men as well, since I see Islam as a failed ideology that forces backwards roles and rules for both men and women to follow. \n\nMoreover, when you show reluctance to criticize Islamic repression, you are in fact allying with those who repress against truly liberal activist minority. We saw exactly this during the Arab Spring. If you keep supporting the pro Islam majority, you aren't doing anything to impact change, and change is not going to happen, because you are supporting the majority and not dissenting voices. To put it short, I don't think appeasement towards Islam works, in terms of producing reform. But it might have some economic benefits. \n\nIt is also is interesting that the guardian chose to highlight voices in support of their view, when the decision to hold the tournament in Iran and force women to wear hijabs is quite unpopular.\n\nFeminism and intersectionality is an interesting issue in regards to women rights, and the conflict between that and Islam. As it is often applied and understood by mainstream and pop feminists of the guardian variety, with their progressive stack and various  pretenses and pretexts, where either Islamic repression of women rights is highlighted as something that doesn't matter because instead wearing a hijab is a feminist choice (link http:\/\/everydayfeminism.com\/2015\/07\/my-hijab-feminist-statement\/) or muslims are the true feminists (link http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/gabby-aossey\/muslims-are-the-true-feminists_b_9877692.html)  or due to more overt cultural relativism of the type that says we will focus on our own country. This is all like trying to square the circle and nonsensical, and the progressive stack betrays legitimate women rights, for the sake of Islam. I don't think it is correct for any women advocate movement or feminists specifically, to be trying to pretend that Islam is feminist or to be defending Islam, when it comes to abuses of women rights. Or rather, when you call Islam feminist, you are explaining how woman rights advocacy isn't as important to feminism as previously thought.\n\nAdvocacy of women rights and Islam aren't compatible, except for a very neutered and much more secularized version of the later, which isn't what is now the case, or the context in which internationalist feminists defend Islam.\n\nForcing women to wear the hijab is a clear case of misogyny and I commend Paikidze for standing against repression of her own rights, and the rights of women elsewhere.","title":"US Chess Champion: I\u2019d Rather Sacrifice My Career Than Be Forced to Wear a Hijab","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/55e9bo\/us_chess_champion_id_rather_sacrifice_my_career\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

Greenwald et al., 2002), revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic own group preference. Experiments 2 and 3 found pro-female bias to the extent that participants automatically favored their mothers over their fathers or associated male gender with violence, suggesting that maternal bonding and male intimidation influence gender attitudes.

And, more importantly, that almost no one cares. Despite flying into a rage over the smallest microagressions against women, we still largely accept that it is a man's responsibility to fight and defend his country, that it is a man's responsibility to put his own safety aside for that of any women, that women deserve public and emotional support but men should have to tough it out alone. Statistics that say women make roughly 78% of what men do are cause for public outcry over horrible sexism, yet 58,185 men vs. 8 women dying in Vietnam is just the normal course of things.\n\nAnd when I say unhealthy, I truly mean unhealthy. The slightest mention of conscription or the world wars or Ukraine can make me sick to my stomach. I can't help but think of all the terrified young men, and sometimes boys, dragged from their families, enslaved, and murdered, while their sisters stayed home nice and safe under the covers, all because they were born the wrong gender.\n\nBut that's not even what makes me mad. What makes me mad is that no one cares. That I'm led to believe that a boy who died in Vietnam at 18 had more privilege than his older sister who is still alive today. That despite the fact that teenage boys are specifically targeted for abductions and killings in Africa seemingly every few weeks, no one cared until the one time girls were abducted. That almost all terrorist attacks in Africa and the Middle East target boys specifically, yet we still say that violence against girls is the primary problem. That if anyone discusses expanding selective service to include women, I'm told that it's a horrible idea because \"imagine if it was your girlfriend, sister, or wife\", and no one seems to care how I would feel if it was my boyfriend, or even me. And that if I bring up any of these concerns I'm instantly labelled a sexist and dismissed.\n\nThe thing is, I really want to support feminism. I know that it is fighting against the systematic biases that lead to this, and I know it's fighting for tons of other legitimate concerns that women have themselves. So I really want to support it. But it's just so hard when I see women complaining about things like the wage gap to silence the little voice in my head that screams that they don't care about my concerns. To scream, \"why should I support your issues if you would dismiss offhand the issues I care about most\". When you read posts from self-proclaimed feminists and women's studies majors on including women in selective service that say:\n\n>If I were in my 30's, I may also agree and think that this is a great step for women to show their equality amongst men. However, I am a 22 year old woman, in Law school, with my future ahead of me. I would shoot myself in the foot before being forced to kill people, and enduring that forced trauma.\n\nWhich basically means \"I'm only 22 and have my whole future ahead of me, I don't want to die\", but for some reason 18 year old \"men\" with their whole futures ahead of them don't matter as much as she does. I want to believe that most feminists aren't like this, but it just doesn't seem that way to me. So everytime I see anything from a feminist, anywhere, about how women are discriminated against in any way, even if they are completely right, I can't help getting infuriated because they would have the guts to complain when at least their life matters.\n\nI didn't post this on the mensrights subreddit because I don't just want people agreeing with me and\/or talking bad about feminism. What I'd really like is some advice. Two pieces of advice, really:\n\n1) How do I stop worrying so much about this issue and get back to enjoying my life? It's quite literally been consuming me for the past year or so. I try to block my news and avoid coming on reddit, but I invariably end up looking up the latest story about African boys being slaughtered, ISIS using child soldiers, or terrified Ukranian conscripts being killed in war, and then my resolve collapses again and the rest of my day is ruined. It doesn't even take that. It could be as simple as a professor bringing up WW2 or that Boyhood actresses' speech at the Oscars.  Does anyone have any advice on how to avoid getting so bothered by this?\n\n2) Any advice, specifically from feminists, on how to reconcile my feelings with feminism and stop being so innately opposed to movements I would like to support solely because I don't think it's fair that what I view as a more serious issue is never getting attention? For instance, I sometimes find myself getting upset whenever anyone mentions the abducted schoolgirls, because the abducted boys are NOT mentioned. Or how to stop getting so mad at the suggestion that I have male privilege because women refuse to admit that they have female privilege too. Or, more specifically, how to word and propose these issues I have without feminists instantly dismissing me as a misogynist.\n\nSorry if this was kind of a rant, but I just needed to get this out there, I think. I just want to live in a society that acknowledges that my life, and the life of people I care about, matter. Not just a little, but as much as everyone else. Equally. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like that will happen, at least not for a long time.","title":"Male Disposability and Frustration","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2wuh0w\/male_disposability_and_frustration\/","upvote_ratio":0.81,"over_18":false}

For example, here is one of the feminist bloggers from Scientific American acknowledging sexism against men^2:\n\n> [Interviewer] Men can be the victims of this too\/Women can be sexist towards men:\n\n> [Melissa Tannenbaum] Yes. I agree. You are absolutely right.\n\nIn addition, social scientists who study sexism are interested in how it affect both genders. For example, a study on *Everyday Sexism* included the following observations^3:\n\n>Men reported observing on average 2.86 sexist incidents directed towards men per week.\n\n>Men's experiences included people calling men \"jerks\", \"pigs\", or \"worthless\", characterizing men as attending too much to women's appearances, or noting that certain groups of men are unsafe for women because of sex crimes.\n\nWhile acknowledging that men face \u201cdiscrimination\u201d, some feminists argue that women \"lack the institutional power that men have.\" This objection has always struck me as myopic. The institutional power that \"men have\" works against men. Gender roles are created and enforced for both sexes. And these roles are distributed through social processes which are not controlled by individual men or even groups of men. As some feminists say: \"patriarchy isn't a conspiracy of mustache-twirling men.\" If men truly controlled the levers of sexism, it might sense for them to relax gender roles for men while maintaining them for women. Instead, we find men routinely oppressed by harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nTo demonstrate these harms, I found this South African gender workshop called *Sexism Hurts Us All* to be poignant. On how gender roles are enforced^4:\n> Failure to follow these proscriptions results in boys being: isolated (an outcast\/no friends); labelled as weak, moffie, sissy, etc.; beaten by fathers, grandparents, other boys or teachers; laughed at by girls; and told they are a failure and feeling like one.\n> The participants also listed the consequences to men for having to behave in the stereotypical way such as: stress and other health problems which shorten their lives; depression; frustration; substance abuse; hurting ourselves or others; isolation from family, friends etc.; loss of self-esteem (if you are not a success); suppression of emotions such as compassion, cooperation, nurturance; and living beyond our means.\n\nAnd when asked what men have to gain by ending sexism, the response was:\n> Peace of mind (enjoy a better life); ease the pressure; good example for your children; less inclined to commit crime and violence; collective decision-making; more productive at work; less tension (improved health); emotional satisfaction; possibility of having close non-sexual relationships with women, men and children; accessing different kinds of experience, e.g., child care and cooking; value things other than material objects; being able to accept help from others; better sense of self identity; and tap into all human resources including women's skills.\n\nThese men feel oppressed by prescriptive gender roles. They want to escape but fear being punished. The punishment can be severe (beatings) and is backed by institutional power (teachers and family.) In other words, these men are experiencing sexism.\n\nI think that the denial of sexism against men has negative consequences for both feminism and men:\n\n* Denying the existence of sexism against men makes it easier to keep the focus on women. For example, preventing the establishment of a White House Council on Men and Boys ensures that more money is available for the Council on Women and Girls.\n\n* Denying the existence of sexism against men obviates the need to confront sexism within the feminist movement. For example, mocking \"male tears\" is just ironic and funny. And if you don't agree, you don't have sense of humor.^5\n\n* Denying the existence of sexism against men justifies the subordination of men within the movement. That is, men are not perceived as equals but merely \"allies\" (because they don't have the capacity to understand sexism.)\n\n* Denying the existence of sexism against men impedes scientific research on gender issues. For example:\n> \"This study found that women demonstrated a desire to control their partners and were more likely to use physical aggression than men. This suggests that IPV may not be motivated by patriarchal values and needs to be studied within the context of other forms of aggression, which has potential implications for interventions.\"^6\n\n\n1. http:\/\/finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com\/2007\/10\/19\/sexism-definition\/\n2. http:\/\/blogs.scientificamerican.com\/psysociety\/2013\/04\/03\/benevolent-sexism-an-addendum\/\n3. http:\/\/melissaferguson.squarespace.com\/storage\/everyday_sexism.pdf\n4. http:\/\/www.icon.org.za\/documents\/seminar_papers\/AGENDAart.pdf\n5. http:\/\/gawker.com\/hating-men-isnt-funny-says-writer-who-doesnt-get-good-1620186188\n6. http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/men\/relationships\/10927507\/Women-are-more-controlling-and-aggressive-than-men-in-relationships.html\n\nP.S.

[1]\n\nThe inclusion of the statistic was initially denied by Jennifer Beeman, the director of the UC Davis' Campus Violence Prevention Program but Department of Justice officials later confirmed that the figure was included in the grant application.\n\n> That number was extrapolated from those provided by The National Victim Center, which estimates that \"approximately 1 in 20 college women are victims of rape or attempted rape each year,\" according to UC Davis' grant application.\n> \n> Beeman, who wrote the application, said she removed the sentence at the suggestion of a grant consultant who advised her that the Department of Justice would not be interested in extrapolated numbers.\n> \n> She said during the application process in the summer of 1999, the Justice Department officials asked her to amend the application several times and as a result she has a number of copies of the application -- some with the sentence, some without.\n> \n> \"If (the sentence) is in there then it's a mistake,\" Beeman said. \"I thought you had the copy I gave the feds. I obviously gave them the wrong copy.\"\n> \n> Department of Justice officials said there is only one version of the grant application in their records, and that document includes the 700 estimate. [1]\n\nSo the inclusion of the figure was an innocent mistake, UC Davis received that and additional VAWA grant funding and went on to successfully implement a successful sexual violence intervention program (or so everyone was lead to believe at the time).\n\n> UC Davis once again has reported more sexual offenses than any other University of California campus, and administrators say it's because of an education campaign aimed at encouraging victims to report the crimes.\nUC Davis Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef appeared to be embracing those education efforts Tuesday when he announced a $999,369 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women that will be used to improve sexual-assault prevention programs on the other nine UC campuses.\n> \n> The University of California, Davis, will lead the three-year effort.\n> \n> Reported sexual offenses on UC Davis property -- which includes the Davis campus and the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento -- rose from 50 in 2005 to 68 last year, compared with 26 at Santa Barbara, 19 at UCLA and 15 at Berkeley in 2006.\n> \n> \"The fact that we have 68 reported sex offenses is sad,\" said Jennifer Beeman, director of the UC Davis Campus Violence Prevention Program.\n> \n> \"But what it says to me is that our interventions are working.\" [2]\n\nBeeman confirmed this in an interview conducted as part of a doctoral dissertation, attributing the high reporting figures as a sign that the confidential reporting system was working and that it was a result of them \"doing their job\".\n\n> During the interview, the researcher asked Tableau if she had an explanation for the relatively high on campus forcible sexual assault statistics contained within the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Valley University Annual Security Reports. The actual numbers reflected were 48 forcible sexual offences in 2005, 68 offenses in 2006 and 69 offenses in 2007. Tableau explained that as a result of the confidential sexual assault reporting program Valley University\u2019s statistics are higher. Tableau stated: \u201cIf our numbers are higher, it means we are doing our job\u201d. The confidential sexual assault reporting program appears to support Clery Act compliance efforts at first glance. However, when the researcher \nasked how documentation of the confidential reports was handled, Tableau offered a rather long explanation that did not answer the question. [3 pp 134]\n\nAnd then everything started going horribly wrong, it was discovered that the 2007 Clery Act statistics reported to the Department of Education were innacurate, they were double the actual number of incidents that actually occurred.\n\n> In 2007, UC Davis students reported 69 cases of forcible sex assault \u2013 a number almost twice as much as all other UC campus reports combined.\n> \n> However, two recent reviews of these numbers have found that the statistics are significantly lower, due to a number of cases that lacked documentation. The new 2007 statistic indicated that in fact 33 cases of forcible sex offenses occurred \u2013 not 69.\n> \n> UC Davis officials announced this at 11 a.m. yesterday, along with the 2008 Clery report - a list of crimes on and off campus that the university is required to release every year. The new 2008 report found that the number of forcible sex offenses was 27 in and around both the Sacramento and Davis campuses.\n> \n> Jennifer Beeman, former director of Campus Violence Prevention Program, was responsible for the inflation of reports, said Robert Loessberg-Zahl, assistant executive vice chancellor.\n> \n> \u201cThe problem with the reporting of these statistics was an isolated incident related solely to one individual,\u201d Loessberg-Zahl said at the press conference.\n> \n> Also, UC officials believe that the incident was \u201cnot an accident,\u201d but were not able to say why Beeman over-reported the numbers. Such information is irrelevant, said Mitchel Benson, assistant vice chancellor for university communications.\n> \n> \u201cWe have not talked to [Beeman] because there\u2019s no need to find out why they are inaccurate. We just need to find out whether they were inaccurate or not,\u201d he said. [4]\n\nAgain it is an isolated incident involving Jennifer Beeman. What is concerning is that even though the university administration acknowledges that it was \"not an accident\", there is no underlying need to investigate the reasons behind it. They do however launch an internal and external review into the Clery Act numbers the university is reporting, the outcome of which I don't really find that surprising in this case.\n\n> The University of California, Davis, has determined that it significantly over-reported the number of forcible sex offenses that were committed on and around campus in 2005, 2006 and 2007, based on an internal review and an independent, outside review of the crime statistics it reports annually to the federal government under the Clery Act.\n> \n> Specifically, in last year\u2019s Clery Act statistics, UC Davis reported 48, 68 and 69 forcible sex offenses in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. However, based on the two recent reviews, UC Davis has determined that the correct statistics for each of the years are less than half those numbers: 21 reported in 2005, 23 in 2006 and 33 in 2007. [5]\n\nTo me this isn't about saying \"*some feminists just make things up*\", rather it's about the complete lack of accountability when they do so. Under the Clery Act, institutions can be fined up to $27,500 per incident for overreporting, underreporting, or misclassification. \n\n> Under the Clery Act, the Department of Education can fine institutions for misrepresenting crime statistics, whether underreporting, overreporting or otherwise conveying inaccurate information. West Virginia University is under investigation by the department and facing fines of as much as $27,500 for misrepresentations made in 2001 and 2002, Carter said. He estimated that Davis could face fines totaling $2.96 million. [6]\n\nFines levied for misreporting under the Clery Act are common an widespread, such as the recent fines levied against the University of Texas at Arlington (emphasis mine).\n\n> I have assessed $27,500 for UTA\u2019s failure to report in its ASR and to the Department 7 LLVs, 16 DLVs, and 4 WLVs for calendar year 2008. *This is a serious violation because the missing crime statistics rendered UTA\u2019s 2008 ASR and crime statistics to the Department virtually inaccurate and unreliable*. I impose a fine of $5,000 for each disciplinary action not included in the statistics up to a maximum of $27,500. In this case, UTA failed to include 27 disciplinary actions so I have assessed the maximum amount.\n\nI'd argue that the number of rapes and sexual assaults reported by UC Davis for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007 made the statistics supplied to the Department of Education  \"virtually inaccurate and unreliable\" and therefore a \"serious violation\". To date there have been no fines levied against UC Davis for these Clery Act violations.\n\nShould UC Davis and Jenifer Beeman be held accountable for misrepresenting these statistics? Why is there a double standard regarding the overreporting and underrporting of sexual assault and rape? Should activists be held accountable for misleading statistics or is it all justifiable as being for the greater good?\n\nThe particularly ironic thing I found was when I was looking for evidence regarding fines being levied against UC Davis for these violations. Attached to a Clery Act complaint regarding UC Davis is a newspaper article containing the following:\n\n> However Beeman, said future statistics from UC Davis counselors will be collected anyway, using a system where numbers are reported anonymously through her office.\n> \n> With the new reporting system, training, and personnel, Beeman said she expects the school's sexual assault numbers to explode.\n> \n> \"My intention with this grant is that  our numbers will increase dramatically,\" she said. \"The success of our prevention program is not going to be that we have fewer numbers. Our success is going to be that our numbers go up.\"\n> \n> Other universities across the country have come to the same conclusion and agressively pushed for more comprehensive statistics. In many cases, such changes occured only in reaction to student demands. [8 pp 29-30]\n\nIn light of Beeman's behaviour surrounding the misleading claims contained in the 1999 grant application, how can anyone be surprised by her subsequent actions? She more or less told everyone what she was going to do in advance, surely this should have been an early indicator that her activities required more scrutiny and supervision.\n\nHonesty. Integrity.

This is actually a projection of the feminist theory of patriarchy: that men oppress women. But the idea of matricentrism\/gynocentrism does not posit any conspiracy, only a set of psychosocial proclivities, in both sexes, which promote preferencing of women and hence, inevitably, the disadvantaging of men. It is a sociodynamic phenomenon, not a conspiracy, and the word \"oppression\u201d is not appropriate, though it could become so if this dynamic continues to amplify.\n\n**The purpose of this post is not to say that men's rights advocates do the same, it's to highlight how terrible this particular feminist viewpoint of men is. After all, Bell Hooks is frequently cited as a \"gentle\" introduction to feminist thinking and referred to as \"one of the good feminists\".**","title":"Mirror, mirror on the wall!

The entire comments are linked because they are relevant to this post. I wanted to talk about this post because the reactions are so polarized for having read the same situation.\n\nFacts of the event:\n\n1. Woman goes to gym and works out with headphones in. She's in a street fighter t-shirt.\n\n2. Man approaches and waves and points at the shirt until the woman removes her headphones and asks what he wants.\n\n3. Man asks \"Do you play?\"\n\n4. She says \"Nope\" and puts her headphones back in.\n\n5. Later she posts this story on social media\n\n6. Some other guy reads the situation and says she has a bad attitude and was offended by a simple wave.\n\nThe comments section devolves into two camps. Camp 1 is Leave People Alone (LPA). They see the story and empathizes with how annoying it can be to be interrupted during a work out. Some talk about the gendered nature of the interaction. They talk about how women are expected to be receptive and [how it makes men mad if they aren't given the time of day](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/facepalm\/comments\/q7wov5\/poor_guy\/hgm2zob\/). \n\nCamp 2 is, charitably, Just Be Nice (JBN). Contrasting from LPA, JBNs see the story and empathize with the guy pointing and waving. Many in the thread suggest that the woman has [done something wrong or impolite here.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/facepalm\/comments\/q7wov5\/poor_guy\/hglfr86\/)\n\nEither camp is prone to adding more content to the story than it actually holds. This is clearly demonstrated for the JBN crowd in the original response to the image, where the intentions of the man are explained as good-natured and normal enthusiasm for fighting games. On the other hand, some on the LPA are too quick to attach explicitly sexual intentions. This serves to polarize the situation, because now JBN hears \"It is never acceptable to talk to strangers\" and LPA hears \"Women are expected to entertain all sexual advances\". To the extent that either side are defending against the other's arguments, they may actually find themselves arguing these points without understanding really how the conversation devolved to that point.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you belong to one of these camps? Do you see similar phenomenon happening in other narratives in gender politics?\n\nEdit: Messed up the first link\n\nEdit2: The twitter thread has much worse comments.","title":"Poor Guy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/q8tgza\/poor_guy\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

Privileges are sign of injustice, something to be dismantled, taken away in the name of equality.\n\nOn the other hand human rights shouldn't be taken off.\n\nEasy test: if X is a right or privilege? If it is impossible for everyone to have X - it is a privilege. Privileges conflict with the rights of others. But it is possible (at least theoretically) for everyone to have equal rights.\n\nIt is common to call something a privilege because not everyone enjoys it, despite that in an ideal society everyone should enjoy it. Individual freedoms, respectful professional attitude at work etc. This things are good, they shouldn't be taken away, on the contrary we should strive for everyone to enjoy these rights. But...\n\nIf group A doesn't enjoy right X, but group B does, X is called B's privilege. This mistake has a huge impact on how people perceive that.\n\nYou can fight against discrimination of A and get support of B, because they know X is good and agree that A should have equal rights. Well, there can be some bigots who object to it, but they are at the moral disadvantage.\n\nNow what happens when we name X privilege. You remember, privilege is something to be dismantled and taken away. You blame B for having something that is actually a human right. You fight to take it away from them (or at least that is looking like that). People of B hate you and get defensive for a valid reason. They perceive you as a threat to their rights.\n\nExamples.\n\nBeing treated at work as a professional, not a sexual object, without condescending or prejudice is something that everyone should have. But, you know, women are facing more problems here. Being treated professionally is human right, not a male privilege.\n\nIndividual freedom is a human right. Draft (not volunteer service, but compulsory) is mostly a male problem. Not being drafted is not a female privilege. It is a human right. Because no one should be drafted.\n\nFixating on privilege when speaking about something that everyone should have is needlessly dividing people. It is only good to steer the victim mentality and band people together on the basis of grief and hatred. It doesn't help solving problems, it exploits problems to pit groups of people against each other. We should address the fact, that someone is discriminated not that someone else is not discriminated.\n\nA lot of gender wars caused by Feminism and MRM are avoidable if we just change the focus to victims of discrimination, rather than perceived privilege.\n\nIt already was in LWMA (no fuss, few upvotes) AskFem (mostly taken negatively, tbh), CMV (people disagreed, had useful feedback - problem is not in word privilege, but in the emphasis on privilege rather than discrimination).\n\nProbably you, ladies & gentlemen, can tell me where I'm wrong.\n\nSo far critique falls into two categories.\n\n1) I misunderstand privilege\n2) Haters gona hate regardless and would be offended, complain whatever feminists say","title":"Is concept of privilege harmful?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/nqlm0l\/is_concept_of_privilege_harmful\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

I'm a fan of Pro Wrestling. I don't usually watch the WWE stuff, but the stuff out of Japan and the independents, I really enjoy. They break a lot of the traditional storytelling molds in a way I find compelling. \n\nA new company, All Elite Wrestling, started running TV shows a year and a few months ago. It has a different vibe from the get go, being less top-down controlled and something more organic and on-going. The relationships feel...stronger. \n\nAEW faced a major tragedy last weekend, as one of its big stars, Brodie Lee (r\/n Jon Huber...if you watched WWE, he used to be Luke Harper) passed away from an unknown non-COVID lung condition. He was sick for some time. This is something that hit the wrestling community hard, with grief just pouring out. He was one of the most popular people...a true family man, someone who put his fatherly responsibilities first before everything else, but at the same time loved what he did. \n\nLast night, on AEW's Dynamite show, they had a Celebration of Life for him. And there was tears all around. One of the big stars, doing commentary, made it clear that it was OK to cry. But at the same time, for the matches, all the stops were thrown out. \n\nBrodie was the leader of what's known as a \"Faction\", I.E. a team of wrestlers, called the Dark Order. They were originally meant to be a creepy mask-wearing cult, but over the last year, they want from something boring to predictable to something endearing. Yes, Brodie played the abusive father to them. But that's the story they were telling. Was how that broke down. The personality just shone through. \n\nIn wrestling, this is often much more than just hey, management said you have to work together in matches. Often factions travel together, certainly they collaborate creatively. Veterans pass down knowledge to the rookies. Make no mistake, Brodie looked at these less-experienced wrestlers as people he wanted to raise up and make better. And what it makes it even better, I think, is that it's not all men. A woman was taken into the group as well, frankly, is presented as the fucking bad-ass of the team, and just makes everything better. \n\nLast night a Dark Order member was in every single match, and won every single match. And not only that. Shone. Showed off everything they learned, as a symbol of love, thanks and respect. \n\nBut at the end of the day, it's all about family. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2IQ4Kr-SnU0\n\nAt the end of the night, Brodie's wife and son (who is actually named Brodie), who previously in the night got to whack the main heel in the company with a kendo stick, were invited out to the ring. The current TNT Championship, which Brodie held for a few months (and young Brodie Jr. slept with every night) was retired, and given to the family for life, with a new Championship to take its place. \n\nIt's rare that we see this level of....positive intensity, this level of real love, and commitment, and family and grief shown in such a raw positive way. \n\nThere's a lot of talk about positive masculinity, about worthy role models. And I feel like...not just a single person. But an entire community presented itself as something worthy to look up to last night, and over the last week. Everybody wishes the tragedy that triggered it never happened. That goes without saying. But frankly, I think this is how change really happens. \n\nI want to shoot another clip. Just to make it clear. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R9iOUm489pU\n\nThe main guy doing stuff, the shorter bald guy, John Silver, really was Brodie's main project. Not your typical wrestler at all, 5'4, but built like a brick shithouse, and very agile. He's also very goofy and filled with this weird charisma. Everything that a Pro Wrestler, traditionally isn't. The outfit he's wearing, was a gift from Brodie, apparently like a thousand dollars, a custom made smaller version of his own ring gear. It was supposed to be for a comedy bit on the YouTube show that really set the stage for AEW (it's a long bloody story). \n\nBut at the end, his two teammates drop off to the side, give him center stage, and John uses Brodie's finisher to win the match. And then breaks down in tears. I dunno. It's been a long time since I've seen something that powerful, loving and wholesome in such an unexpected (to most people. I think a lot of modern wrestling watchers wouldn't be that surprised) source.","title":"A Public Celebration of Masculinity, Fatherhood and Family","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/knsq7o\/a_public_celebration_of_masculinity_fatherhood\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

It is one of my favorite things in the world and one of the few things that makes me proud to live in Utah. I am normally an introverted guy but I feel pretty comfortable there and I love to get to talk to filmmakers and get their insight on the movies they have made. \n\nIn years past, one of the coolest things about the fest was that every movie was pretty interesting, maybe not a masterpiece, but they covered weird topics or had some insight that you wouldn't expect and they were worth the price of admission for sure.  Recently however, over the past few years, the focus seems to have started moving from being purely about the best movies toward including a social political agenda. The goal seems to be to equalize the genders of filmmakers and increase LBGTQ+ presence. It's to the point that they have signs up at the fest reminding us and are posting identity statistics such as: \n\n>[45% of the directors in this year\u2019s U.S. Documentary Competition are women; 23% are people of color; 23% are LGBTQ+.](https:\/\/www.sundance.org\/blogs\/news\/2020-sundance-features-announced)\n\nOver the same time as this push, I have noticed a marked decrease in the quality of the low end of movies. There have been more movies that are extremely hard to get tickets for and more movies failing to sell out, which isn't very common for Sundance in my experience. \n\nI hope it goes without saying, that obviously a woman director is just as capable as a man. I suspect the problem comes with the pool of submitted movies directed by men likely being much larger than the pool directed by women (I don't have data on this) and thus forcing the selectors to reach deeper into the pool to maintain gender balance. After seeing a few duds, I now find myself much more wary of the identity of the filmmaker which I think is a very bad thing. \n\nWhat I find even more concerning than the focus of identity in filmmaking, is the topic of the festival panels moving from filmmaking to societal issues. For example, at the beginning of this year\u2019s fest, I was going to a screening of the movie Possessor and wanted to hit a panel before. There were 5 panels, and ALL had some gendered aspect to them. \n\n[The Atlantic Presents: Film Talk\u2014The Assistant (#MeToo)](https:\/\/www.sundance.org\/projects\/the-atlantic-presents-film-talk-the-assistant)\n\n[Women Behind the Camera](https:\/\/www.sundance.org\/projects\/women-behind-the-camera)\n\n[Slate\u2019s Thirst Aid Kit (dig deep into the various ways women express their thirst)](https:\/\/www.sundance.org\/projects\/slate-s-thirst-aid-kit)\n\n[Women Hold Up Half the Sky](https:\/\/www.sundance.org\/projects\/women-hold-up-half-the-sky)\n\n[Women Breaking Barriers, Year 3: How Far Have We Come?](https:\/\/www.sundance.org\/projects\/women-breaking-barriers-year-3-how-far-have-we-come)\n\nI don't see anything wrong with any one of these panels, but are we really at such a dire point that we cannot have some other topics? And, for those who are interested in women's issues, even they wouldn't be able to attend all of these because they run at the same time. \n\nIt seems that at least some of the attendees have embraced the culture shift. I noticed counting of called on audience members to ensure (perceived?) gender balance. I think that is probably unnecessary but I don't really see a problem with it in that case. \n\nThere were cases that I feel did cross the line as well. Such as after watching Leap of Faith: William Friedkin on The Exorcist, a documentary on the making of the movie. In an audience mostly full of men, a woman in front of me got upset that the first few Q&A questions were asked by men and decided to call out the host on it. Somewhat ironically interrupting a question from another woman. The host caved and called on the obnoxious woman next and her \"question\" was that she disagreed with the director of The Exorcist on the ending of The Exorcist. \n\nI was happy with the job the host was doing, discerning the best questioners from the audience. To instead change course and make bad decisions based on social pressure felt like a reflection of the festival as a whole. \n\nI get that Sundance has always been at least somewhat about human experience and shining a light on issues, but those issues used to be forward thinking and truly progressive, not just [pandering](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GxQgeONyYOw&feature=youtu.be&t=1413) and low-hanging fruit issues that every reasonable person agrees with.","title":"I fear gender politics is ruining the Sundance Film Festival","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/f2yum8\/i_fear_gender_politics_is_ruining_the_sundance\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

In my experience, shaming tends to work very well on men.  It isn't something you can fight or over power.  It isn't something you can defend against by having accomplishments.  Shame is an attack on pride and, when in public, an attack on respect.\n\nOne of my early experiences with masculinity interacting with societal views on homosexuality (this was mid 90's in the Midwest) was being called into a meeting with the principle at the small Christian school I attended along with my very good friend to have a sit down about the amount of physical interaction between us.  While I remember occasions of walking between classes with an arm around the sholder of the other person, we weren't holding hands or making overt signs of affection.  The concern was that some people felt it might be a sign of something inappropriate for two young teen males to engage publicly in physical contact.\n\nAt this point I would say I have a healthy and liberal view of homosexuality and my friend came out as gay several years later.  But what struck me then is that we had a barrier enforced between us.  While no one was claiming that either of us were breaking the rules, we both stopped the behavior that put us in such an uncomfortable situation.  Shame or the threat of shame worked immediately and effectively.\n\nWhat then of ideas like toxic masculinity?  To listen to those who champion the word, it is describing the extrema of behaviors that are detrimental to men and boys.  If that is the case and adding shame to the idea leads to less men engaging in such acts, isn't that a good thing?  The problem is that shame can be too effective.  Men tend to respond to shame, not by fighting back but by withdrawing to a safe position.  Men retreated from intimate relationships so as not to give the impression of being gay and we are seeing the consequence of that.  Men are shamed for clumsy or undesired interactions with women and they go MGTOW.  What happens when men retreat from having a strong male identity (the fragile masculinity obsession with items marketed to men) or from taking risks and preparing for potential threats down the road (toxic masculinity)?\n\nShame is effective at eliciting a change, but that change is uncontrollable and can have very harmful consequences and men retreat back into ever smaller bounds of safe to express masculinity.","title":"The perils of using shame on men.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/9min91\/the_perils_of_using_shame_on_men\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

Even still, the court said that he was sentenced not for the hugging but because of \"a broader pattern of sexual exploitation\"\n - The student was 17, which is over the age of consent in Iowa (where it is 16)\n - It was deemed illegal because they presumed his intention was sexual exploitation and grooming\n\nThe [original post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/88i0l9\/male_teacher_gets_5_years_in_prison_for_hugging_1\/) was on r\/MensRights (since removed) to highlight a supposed double standard\n\nHere is my opinion: the text messages described cuddling, not platonic but also not explicitly sexual (someone described it as \"sexting\", which I think is an overstatement). So at best, he got 5 years for sending text messages about how he wanted to cuddle with his student\n\nThat's the only thing that can be known objectively. In the court's opinion, he wanted to groom her expressly for his sexual satisfaction. In their opinion, his intentions were selfish and predatory\n\nWhat I think is that much of their opinion is due to his gender. If a woman texted a legal-aged male student about how much she wanted to cuddle with him, but said that she would wait until he graduated to actually be in a relationship with him, would her behavior be seen as grooming, sexually exploitative, predatory, and selfish, or would she be perceived as being in love with him and doing the responsible thing for waiting until he graduated?\n\nI think it's the latter. Especially since there are already no shortage of instances where women have avoided jail altogether for actually having completed sex with [multiple boy students](http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-5560345\/Arkansas-teacher-26-sex-four-students-not-jailed.html) or boys [much younger](http:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/236821\/woman-raped-boy-13-with-nice-body-gets-probation.html) than 17. It's already been found that there's a [sentencing gap](http:\/\/www.ncdsv.org\/images\/fc_sex-basedsentencingdiscrepanciesbetweenmaleandfemalesexoffenders_2012.pdf) for female sexual offenders in general, and it seems that part of it is because of things like this case: because people--even in law enforcement--*presume that male offenders have more malevolent intentions than female offenders*\n\nA common claim that can be found within articles regarding female sexual offenders is that their drive is romantic, they fall in love with their victims: hence, the [\"teacher \/ lover\"](https:\/\/www.kent.ac.uk\/psychology\/people\/gannont\/Publication%206.pdf) typology being one of the three, along with \"male-coerced\" and \"predisposed\" (meaning having been abused herself in the past). Which means the only options are that female offenders are either victims themselves or are actually lovers rather than abusers\n\nBut how can people know the intent of these women, whether she really loves him, or if she's just grooming him by pretending to love him? How is a woman texting lovey-dovey messages to a boy and waiting until he graduates to have a relationship a sign that she's truly in love with him, but a man texting lovey-dovey messages to a girl and waiting until she gradates to have a relationship a sign of using her for sexual gratification and grooming?\n\nHis sentence was based on the perception that his hugging and his messages were with the intent to groom, but the problem is that this isn't an objective measure. The court decides in their opinion what they think his intentions were. They decide in their opinion what they think women's intentions are\n\nFor this reason, it's subject to gender stereotypes that people may hold, e.g. that men are predators driven by wanting to sexually dominate; women are nurturing and romantic driven by wanting to form emotional bonds","title":"Teacher sentenced to 5 years in jail for suggestive text messages to student: does this case reflect gender stereotypes and presumptions?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/88k4t0\/teacher_sentenced_to_5_years_in_jail_for\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

It revolves around the infamous \"where have all the good men gone\" type articles, as well as a recent post in this subreddit about the lack of college educated men, and certain people's posts about how it is negatively effecting women's dating possibilities.\n\nFor general context: I was in a class of 25 in high school, of which 8 (including myself) were blokes. Out of those 8, 7 went on to get degrees from college (Masters or a PhD). We are all currently in our late twenties.\n\nAll of these guys are, on paper, \"good men\", in that they are, again in theory, husband material. The one who didn't get a college degree is a full-time nurse, and the others have degrees in fields as diverse as Law, Maths, Mechanical engineering, Microengineering, Litterature and Architecture. Out of the 8, 6 are currently married and awaiting child, married, or in a long term (i.e. over 3 years) relationship (started when in college normally). The only two who are not are a guy who got a PhD in Math, and myself, with a degree in Robotics. None of us suffered from any noticeable or debilitating form of social anxiety, none were unable to find short term girlfriends, etc... when in high school. All of this is to give context for my next point.\n\nSo where have the \"good men\" gone? Well, from my personal experience (and this also applies to other classes in my high school, by the way), they decided during college to engage in long-term, monogamous relationships which were successful. The two who are not currently in that situation did not. Identically, the women that they are currently married to\/dating also made that decision: they signed up to long-term, monogamous relationships. These women are relatively similar to the men, in terms of academic success, by the way: college educated women, in fields like Law, Literature, Environmental Engineering, and the like. So the good men haven't \"gone\" anywhere, they just took the decision to shack up with women who, also, decided to shack up.\n\nAnd what about those who currently aren't in long term relationships? Well, from my personal point of view, nothing could interest me less. I am currently concentrating on my career and enjoying the bachelor life, as is the other guy from my HS class. And I accept the negatives of my decisions, too. Feeling lonely sometimes, a lack of emotional intimacy, etc... But I don't blame women. I don't ask \"where have all the good women gone\", because I know the answer to that: I pushed them away, via my personal life choices. I made the decision, and I am, mostly, happy with those decisions.\n\nSo where does this idea that the good men are in short supply stem from? I believe it stems from a place of entitlement. The tiny minority of women who complain about the lack of \"good men\" are, in fact, complaining about the negative side-effects of their own life choices. If you actively spent your twenties concentrating on your education, work and social life without putting a load of energy into a long-term relationship, then of course your outcome is going to be different. It isn't that the good men have gone anywhere: they were most likely around you, all the time. You just weren't looking for that, at the time. However, what seems to be the problem is that you either expected them to wait for you, or that you could just snap your fingers and one would appear 10 years down the road, neither of which is realistic or should even be an expectation.\n\nIs my point of view horribly biased by my personal experience? What are yours with regards to this \"problem\" (I'm not convinced it is one)?","title":"Where have all the good men gone: Personal experience","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/701bju\/where_have_all_the_good_men_gone_personal\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

I'd be much hotter and more compelling to a much wider swathe of partners once I passed 40, though.  \n\nHow about you?  What would have changed for you?  (You may note above--I was trying to balance positives with negatives, and I'll find responses that attempt to look at *both* ups and downs of a gender flip more interesting.) And also, what major categories of considerations might I have missed..?  (I'm sure I've missed some!)\n\n\n","title":"If I'd been a man..?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4mwaof\/if_id_been_a_man\/","upvote_ratio":0.77,"over_18":false}

It's directed at people who believe in gender equality as a goal but are not feminists or feminist-allies.**\n\nA lot of people here have posted about legitimate criticisms of feminism. These criticisms are important and useful. For example, yes, many of you are right that feminism does not always adequately deal with race issues. Yes, feminism has problems with transphobia. Yes, feminism does not always use the most precise terms possible. Yes, sometimes feminists have an approach that's alienating to men and other people. Yes, some feminists sometimes make inappropriate arguments or use hostile tactics. Yes, in some ways feminism is too broad and unfocused.\n\nFeminism is a flawed movement with flawed people. But that is exactly why feminist-critical people should support it, because feminism *needs* diverse and critical voices in order to improve.\n\nIn other words, feminism being flawed is not a good justification for not being a feminist. In fact, it's a good justification for *being* a feminist. It's not a reason to dismiss feminism as a whole, or a reason to try to undermine it, or try to discredit feminism's image. (not saying all of you do this--just some people, maybe unintentionally)\n\n**If you agree with feminism's core goals of gender equality, but believe feminism has flaws that need to be improved, then you should help feminism improve those flaws.**\n\nHelp us brainstorm better terms. Help educate people on good outreach and positive rhetoric. Help banish transphobia from feminism. Help shape the next wave of the feminist movement so that it's more effective, more positive, and more useful.\n\nIf you don't want to use the label feminism, at least become a feminist ally. (I know many of you are already feminist allies, but this is directed to the people who aren't).\n\nIt's ok if you have major disagreements with feminists. Some feminists may even accuse you of not really being a feminist if you don't agree with them. In my experience as a feminist, it's pretty common for us to do that to each other in heated arguments. But disagreement is good and healthy as long as we focus on the core goal of gender equality.\n\nConsider the benefits for feminist-critical people to become feminists\/feminist allies:\n\n* Helping to shape the future of feminism\n* Helping to brainstorm better terms and tactics\n* Being able to discuss criticisms of feminism with feminists from a place of shared goals (which will make feminists more receptive and open to those criticisms)\n* Being a good role model for other feminists to look at\n* Participating in a community that can potentially improve your own gender theories\n* Supporting real work being made toward gender equality\n* Connecting yourself to a long history of activism and a large body of theoretical and academic work about gender equality\n* Connecting yourself to the largest group of gender equality activists, and the organizations with the most resources to dedicate to activism\n\n\nIf you believe feminism's goals are good and important, then I seriously hope you join it so that you can help improve it. I guess this post is trying to \"sell\" feminism, but what can I say, I'm here because I want to justify why people should be feminists.\n\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold! :D","title":"Feminism is a flawed movement, but that is why you should support it","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/3p1dip\/feminism_is_a_flawed_movement_but_that_is_why_you\/","upvote_ratio":0.71,"over_18":false}

The goal of this series is twofold. Foremost, we wish to draw attention to the various ways in which issues can affect everyone. We know that some people get tired of hearing one-sided analyses, so we are going to try and combat that head on. We will try to look at these issues in a non-partisan manner and focus on the victims of whatever issue we are discussing. We hope this has a side-effect of bringing together feminists, MRAs and everyone in between, and get people thinking about how issues can be fixed. Secondly, by attempting to look into one issue at a time in depth, we hope that people may learn something (and hopefully we will learn things too, both by doing the research and through your responses). \n\n---\n\n###A Few Notes\n\nFor this post, we are mostly focusing on rape in the USA. A few sources come from other industrialized countries such as Scotland and Canada, and one example is pulled from India. Rape in developing countries is a topic that while we hope to cover it another day, is contextually different enough from rape in the USA\/industrialized countries to warrant a separate post. Additionally, we are not covering prison rape. The logic behind this choice is similar to what was previously mentioned: it easily deserves a separate post to really dig into the context in which it occurs. \n\nSecondly, keeping with [our deep-seated belief that arguing over who has it worse is ineffective for promoting change](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2s4p9u\/cmv_arguing_over_who_has_it_worse_is_mostly_a\/), we have chosen to not delve into prevalence statistics. While an important and interesting topic to discuss, we believe it is not appropriate for this post.\n\n---\n\n###Intro to the Issue\n\nThe first topic we have chosen to delve into is rape. A contentious and divisive issue amongst some to be sure, but one in which we both feel comfortable talking about in depth. The context in which historical definitions of rape were made can help to understand how and why the law has changed as customs have changed. One of the oldest ancient law codes is the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi from ~1780 B.C.E. This code stated that [virgin [women] were innocent if raped, but their attackers could face penalties up to and including execution. Married women who were raped were considered guilty of adultery, and both the attacker and the victim could be executed](http:\/\/books.google.ca\/books?id=tVeh3C8XGP4C&lpg=PA14&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false) (pg 14-15). Rape at this point in time was largely seen as a property crime against the father of a female victim. Moving to modern times, the FBI changed their definition of rape in 2012 to \u201cPenetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim\u201d, [which includes male victims who were made to penetrate](https:\/\/tamenwrote.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/04\/fbi-clarifies-definition-of-rape\/). This was a change from their old definition of [\u201cThe carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will\u201d](http:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/about-us\/cjis\/ucr\/recent-program-updates\/new-rape-definition-frequently-asked-questions ). \n\nEarly statistics on rape were almost exclusively based on reports made to the police.  The advantage of this is that it was relatively easy to compile statistics of rapes which were reported to police, but had the major disadvantage of being completely unable to track rapes which were, for whatever reason, not brought to the attention of law enforcement.  Additionally, police can be biased. They may have counted some incidents as rape which were likely made up, and counted others as false reports when they were likely reported by someone who wasn\u2019t an \u201cideal victim\u201d.  The obvious solution to this problem was to question the population to determine if they\u2019d been raped.  Questioning the entire population is cost prohibitive, so instead random, representative samples were selected.  This solved several problems: underreporting was no longer an issue; without police involvement, reports were much less likely to be falsely rejected; and with much less motivation to fabricate reports, it can safely be concluded that malicious accusations decreased as well.  However, it also introduced a new issue: how does one know that the incident the person surveyed is thinking of when they say \u201cI was raped\u201d is accurate?  That is, how do you know the subject wasn\u2019t mistaken about whether what happened to them was actually rape?  The solution is fairly straight forward: a definition of rape is provided to the subject for clarification *before* they answer the relevant question(s).  However, that raises the question: why not just ask the subjects if any of the things mentioned in the definition had happened to them and use that to determine if they\u2019d been raped, rather than giving them the definition and asking them the same question.  Or for that matter, asking people if they\u2019d ever *done* any of those things to anyone else, to measure the prevalence of rapists.  Early attempts at doing this discovered that rape was even more common than previous studies had indicated, but this was partially due to the overly broad nature of the initial questions.  Additionally, the earliest studies only examined male-on-female rape.  Since then, there have been improvements in neutrality and question design.\n\n---\n\nNow we are going to try and break down the ways in which men and women are affected by rape. The sections below are suggestions. They do not in any way imply that a man cannot face an issue that we placed under the woman\u2019s section, or vice versa. This list we believe to be comprehensive, but is certainly not exhaustive. \n\n---\n\n###Issues Some Women May Face\n\n* People may make assumptions in certain circumstances, including an intersection of gender and race, in which people may assume the victim is a prostitute, or otherwise \"deserved\" to be raped.\n\n* Women who are raped by other women have nearly no literature or resources to turn to, and face some of the issues men face when it comes to having a female perpetrator *and* some of the issues women face when it comes to being a female victim^1. \n\n* [Women can be chastised for what they wore at the time of the attack, implying they may have \"deserved\" it or are partially responsible for the rape](http:\/\/www.gov.scot\/Resource\/Doc\/232321\/0063563.pdf) (pg 8). \n\n* [Women can be chastised for not preventing it in the first place](http:\/\/www.vox.com\/2015\/3\/5\/8156881\/india-rape), even [though we know most rapes](https:\/\/www.ncjrs.gov\/pdffiles1\/nij\/210346.pdf) (pg 21) against [women occur by those they know and sometimes trust](http:\/\/www.hawaii.edu\/hivandaids\/Similarities_And_Differences_In_Women_s_Sexual_Assault_Experiences_Based_On_Tactics.pdf) (pg 327).\n\n* Women are sometimes doubted by those who think they may just be \"regretting it\" or \"calling rape\", or if they were drinking and\/or doing drugs at the time of the rape.\n\n* [If a woman becomes pregnant by rape, there are powerful politicians who believe it is not a real rape.](http:\/\/fox2now.com\/2012\/08\/19\/the-jaco-report-august-19-2012\/) \n\n* If a woman becomes pregnant by rape and choses to have the baby, [the rapist retains the same custodial rights as a non-rapist father in 31 states (as of 2013)](http:\/\/georgetownlawjournal.org\/files\/pdf\/98-3\/Prewitt.PDF). \n\n---\n\n###Issues Some Men May Face:\n\n* Male survivors tend to question their sexual orientation more often than women who have been raped (particularly those who have been raped by men).\n\n* Some men may feel that part of their masculinity has been stripped away, that they have been feminized, or are somehow less manly because they have been sexually violated.\n\n* Men do not have widespread access to resources like self-help books and support groups. Given the stigma surrounding adult male rape, a survivor may deal with his issues in total isolation.\n\n* [Some people, including those in a position to help a male victim, judge the rape of men by women to be \u201charmless and benign\u201d](https:\/\/www.ncjrs.gov\/app\/abstractdb\/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=189589).\n\n* Men may fear the double-whammy of having the rape turned around on them to the tune of a false accusation.  This could potentially^2 be used as a method of blackmail to commit rape in the first place.\n\n* [If a male rape victim ends up impregnating their rapist, they may end up liable for child support.](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hermesmann_v._Seyer) \n\n* Men may be blamed for not preventing their attack, though this usually focuses on reactive measures (i.e. fighting their attacker off) rather than preemptive measures. \n\n* [Men share a set of rape myths that are often erroneous, sexualizing and homophobic](http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1348\/014466606X101780\/abstract). These [rape myths are sometimes perpetuated by those who are in a position to help](http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/j.1556-6678.2003.tb00272.x\/abstract). \n\n* [As many as 37 per cent of rape crisis centres restrict services to females only] (https:\/\/www.ncjrs.gov\/App\/publications\/Abstract.aspx?id=164075). \n\n---------\n\n###Issues Some Men and Some Women May Face in Roughly Equal Amounts:\n\n* [There is a backlog of rape kits which need to be tested](http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/magazine-30554719), which hurts the victims who need them tested and [the accused who could be acquitted with that evidence](http:\/\/www.columbian.com\/news\/2013\/oct\/22\/clark-county-wrongful-conviction-rape-northrop-dav\/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) \n\n* [Since many men have erections or ejaculate during their rape as a response to extreme pain or fear, they might feel guilty of even attempting to describe their experience as rape, fearing others will believe they enjoyed the assault. Women can orgasm and experience \u201cwetness\u201d during rape as well.](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15261004) \n\n* [Some studies show a very heightened risk for being a rape victim if working as a sex worker](http:\/\/www.arte-sana.com\/articles\/prostitution_violence.htm). Additionally, [sex workers may find that they are not offered the same legal protection as other citizens as a result of their line of work](http:\/\/www.opposingviews.com\/i\/society\/crime\/activists-rally-against-reelection-judge-who-ruled-sex-worker-rape-was-only-theft). \n\n* There are various concerns over [Article 32 proceedings](http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/09\/21\/us\/intrusive-grilling-in-rape-case-raises-alarm-on-military-hearings.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) and the effect they may have on victims of sexual assault in the military coming forward.\n\n* Some states define rape in such a way that excludes or diminishes the severity of rape for some victims. For example, [first degree rape in Alabama refers to the rape by one person of the opposite gender](http:\/\/codes.lp.findlaw.com\/alcode\/13A\/6\/4\/13A-6-61), which is a [Class A felony (Class A refers to a crime in which one can be punished for no less than 10 years and no more than life or 99 years)](http:\/\/www.criminaldefenselawyer.com\/resources\/criminal-defense\/felony-offense\/alabama-felony-class.htm). [Sodomy of the first degree refers to the male rape of another man](http:\/\/codes.lp.findlaw.com\/alcode\/13A\/6\/4\/13A-6-63), which is a Class B felony (Class B refers to a crime in which one can be punished for no less than two years and no more than 20 years). There is no law in Alabama that defines rape in such a way that protects women from female rapists. In fact, it is not even classified as [sexual abuse](http:\/\/codes.lp.findlaw.com\/alcode\/13A\/6\/4\/13A-6-66). In some other states, [such as Idaho](http:\/\/www.legislature.idaho.gov\/idstat\/Title18\/T18CH61SECT18-6101.htm), the rape of men is not defined by law using the same terminology or degree of offense as the rape of women.\n\n* [Homosexual and bisexual men and women who have been raped by someone of the same sex might be silenced for fear of having their sexual identity revealed to others](http:\/\/www.odh.ohio.gov\/~\/media\/ODH\/ASSETS\/Files\/hprr\/sexual%20assult\/appendix182011.ashx).^3\n\n---\n\n###Ways to Address Rape:\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly important that people have a foundation of statistical literacy when they are reading studies. When looking at a study, it is important to note sample sizes (typically the bigger and more heterogeneous the better), methods of sample selections (the more random the better; be wary of studies that rely on self-selection), confidence intervals (the higher the better; typically CI>95%), p-levels (the smaller the better; typically p<0.05), methodologies, and biases (funding sources, reason for researching, etc). Particularly when it comes to rape studies, things to look out for include ambiguous wording that includes instances of rape which are typically not accepted as rape (e.g. using words such as \u2018unwanted\u2019 without clarification, thereby counting instances when one partner may not have \u201cwanted to\u201d have sex (if they had the flu, for example), but did in fact consent to have sex), wording that excludes various types of rape (i.e. not measuring being made to penetrate, but stating that they measure the prevalence of both female and male victims, counting penetration for oral sex (i.e. oral stimulation of the penis) but not including the typical female equivalent (i.e. oral stimulation of the clitoris, which does not include penetration)), etc. It may be worthwhile to those interested in discussing rape to take a read through [this](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1rnjkh\/rape_statistics\/) post and the comments to see what some of the limitations are in some studies that have already been conducted to have an example of what to look for. \n\nAdding on to the last point, one thing that can be done relatively easily is to fix the way we measure rape.  Currently, too few metrics are gender neutral, even in theory, and fewer still consider being made to penetrate to be rape.  Fixing this - and researching the discrepancy between the lifetime and recent victimization statistics - would help shed light on the problem and bring male (particularly female on male) rape victimization into the mainstream consciousness.\n\n[[Continued in the comments]](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2yr8n5\/inclusive_indepth_investigations_of_issues_1_rape\/cpc75cu)","title":"Inclusive In-depth Investigations of Issues - 1 - Rape","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2yr8n5\/inclusive_indepth_investigations_of_issues_1_rape\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

And I feel like really offering my sincere thanks. I know tone is sometimes hard to communicate online, so I want you to know I'm saying this with genuine sincerity as an expression of my thanks.\n\nFirst, \/u\/TheBananaKing's thread [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2gd4qs\/im_finding_this_sub_a_little_unbalanced_lately\/ckiuiaw?context=9). It initially made me grumpy, and I didn't feel like the discussion was really going places. I didn't really understand where they were coming from, and it seemed like more of an attack on feminism than a constructive debate. But then, [this comment happened](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2gd4qs\/im_finding_this_sub_a_little_unbalanced_lately\/ckiuiaw). I don't know where the conversation will go from here, but I felt like it was a major huge step in the right direction. I understand where they're coming from, I follow their train of thought, and from here, I genuinely expect us to have a constructive discussion that won't make me grumpy and won't make me want to flip tables. It's tangible, their points are now clearly explained, and it's just a much better discussion. So, mad props to \/u\/TheBananaKing for this change. <3\n\nAnd amazingly, in the same morning, another user, \/u\/PutBoy had another conversation with me [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2gd4qs\/im_finding_this_sub_a_little_unbalanced_lately\/ckiu90b?context=10000). Which was going genuinely terribly until he made a genuine and heartfelt apology [in this comment](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2gd4qs\/im_finding_this_sub_a_little_unbalanced_lately\/ckiu90b). It really genuinely is profoundly appreciated. \n\nI realize that, for a lot of people, especially those who have had exceptionally poor experiences with feminists online or offline, or who've had the unfortunate circumstance of being a cishet white male disagreeing with a [Davidesque](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1v7ctf\/a_special_thanks_to_everyone_here_who_hasnt\/ceprl1q?context=10000) SJW, there's an understandable level of anger at feminism. But I just wanted to say that I personally really appreciate it when you make the effort to leave that baggage at the door, and when you show that you're committed to a respectful discussion about the issues at hand, and acknowledge the individual you're speaking with as a real person whose feelings matter.\n\nSo, yeah. I'd just like to thank both of these users for changing tack, and helping to stimulate constructive discussion about these difficult issues. I think these are both great examples of how this sub can work towards promoting feminist readership and participation. Keep it up, and good work. :)\n\n<3 - proud_slut","title":"Flipping the table back onto its feet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2ghq64\/flipping_the_table_back_onto_its_feet\/","upvote_ratio":0.77,"over_18":false}

Unlike the 200 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria, this story has gone pretty much unnoticed and unacknowledged in the mainstream media. There is surprisingly little awareness that this has actually happened let alone a social media campaign designed to get the world to take action. The first mainstream media reporting of this was from *The Guardian* on June 26, nearly a whole month after the incident occurred.\n\n> The kidnapping of 186 teenage boys in Syria on 30 May has gone largely unreported in the wider world, a curious omission given the outcry over the teenage girls in Nigeria. The abduction was no less sinister. The students needed to travel from the Kobani enclave on the Turkish border to Aleppo to take their exams, as required by Syria's education system. The journey is perilous, but they reached Aleppo without incident. On the way home, however, a convoy of about 10 minibuses containing 186 boys aged 14-16 was stopped and taken to a religious school in Minbej, for training in the Qur'an and jihad. The vast majority are still there. [1]\n\nIt wasn't simply the case that it was only male students in the convoy, girls were also detained, but like Boko Haram's attacks on schools in Nigeria the girls were let go. The boys were targeted solely based on their gender.\n\n> All three fathers said that a large group of male and female students had travelled on May 29 to Aleppo, 110 kilometers from Ain al-`Arab, to take their official school exams because the Syrian government was not offering the exam in their town. The journey required the children to pass through territory controlled by ISIS.\n> \n> The top education official in Ain al-'Arab, Hussein Mohammad Ali, told Human Rights Watch that at least 1,000 students, ages 13 to 18, travelled to Aleppo in buses and mini-buses, along with some teachers. ISIS allowed the convoy to proceed to Aleppo, but stopped the first group that returned \u2013 13 and 14 year-olds from the ninth grade \u2013 in the ISIS-controlled town of Manbij, Ali and the two other local officials said. There ISIS fighters separated the boys from the girls and sent the girls home with the drivers.\n> \n> About 100 girls from the class returned to Ain al-'Arab, Ali said. The rest of the children stayed in Aleppo and eventually returned safely to Ain al-'Arab via other routes, but 153 of the ninth-grade boys were forced to remain in Manbij.\n> \n> \u201cWe found out they were kidnapped the next day [May 30] from the families of the girls who were let go,\u201d the father of an abducted 13-year-old boy said. \u201cThe girls were let go with one of the bus drivers who drove them to a civilian house where they rested and called their families.\u201d [2]\n\nAlso unlike the 200 girls kidnapped in Nigeria, there have been no official statements from the United States government who didn't even acknowledge the kidnapping had for more than a month after it occurred.\n\n> Yet, with the kidnapping of the schoolgirls in Nigeria, the U.S. went as far as sending 80 soldiers to Chad to assist in searching for the children. Other nations helped the Nigerian government with satellite information. Until now, though, the U.S. has not acknowledged the Kurdish children\u2019s\u2019 kidnapping in Syria. [3]\n\nAnd like the previous posts I have made about the media reporting surrounding [Boko Haram's targeting of boys](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1yyoak\/men_and_boys_the_hidden_victims_of_gender_based\/) and reporting on the [Egyptian mass death sentences](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/21w657\/media_bias_528_men_sentenced_to_death_after_mass\/) (and [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/248xm4\/media_bias_another_683_egyptian_men_sentenced_to\/)), in the vast majority of reports on the kidnapping their gender isn't even mentioned, or only mentioned in passing.\n\nThe best example of this is from NBC News, they are referred to as children or students, it mentions that the schoolgirls were released but the words boy or male don't even appear once.\n\n> Al Qaeda-inspired extremists kidnapped at least 150 children as they went home after exams in northern Syria, Kurdish leaders told NBC News on Friday. Aged between 10 and 15, the students were traveling from the city of Aleppo to their hometown Kobani when they were abducted by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) at the end of May, Kurdish rebel commander Ali Muslim said. Among them were dozens of schoolgirls who were released within hours, said a Kurdish political activist who spoke on the condition of anonymity. [4]\n\nThe rest of them use the words children, students, and teenagers with the words boy or boys only appearing once or twice in the article ([Miami Herald](http:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/2014\/06\/21\/4193086\/kidnapped-kurdish-school-children.html), [CNN](http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2014\/06\/06\/world\/meast\/syria-kurdish-students\/), [McClatchy DC](http:\/\/www.mcclatchydc.com\/2014\/06\/21\/231096\/kidnapped-kurdish-school-children.html)). If you don't read the articles carefully the gender issue can easily be missed.\n\nIn fact, the International Business Times [3] article spends more time talking about the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram, terrorism, and the Syrian conflict in general than it does talking about the kidnapped boys.\n\nSo where are all the feminists, social justice activists, and those who stood behind the campaign to #BringBackOurGirls? The only community that I have seen that has tried to even raise any awareness about the issue is the MRM. We need everyone to stand up and let the world know that we need to #BringBackOurBoys.\n\n1.

To cite from Jim R. Macnamara 2006 study:**\n\n\nThis extensive analysis of mass media news, current affairs, talk shows and lifestyle media found that these primary sources of what are claimed and widely seen as \u2018fact\u2019, \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 predominantly portray men as violent and aggressive thieves, murderers, wife and girlfriend bashers, sexual abusers, molesters, perverts, irresponsible deadbeat dads and philanderers, even though, in reality, only a small proportion of men act out these roles and behaviors. [...] almost 70% of all reporting and comment on men and male identity in the mass media genre studied was negative and more than 80% of portrayals of men and male identity were unfavourable. Violence and aggression are overwhelmingly the most frequent representations associated with men and boys [...] Men and boys are also widely represented as irresponsible, risk-taking, commitment phobic, insensitive, undomesticated, out of touch with their feelings and poor communicators.\n\n\nWith the exception of a small minority of positive media portrayals of male heroes such as war veterans, fire fighters and rescuers, and an equally small percentage of portrayals of men as good fathers, husbands and citizens, the only males presented positively are men and boys who have been \u2018feminised\u2019 such as \u2018metrosexuals\u2019 and males who exhibit \u201ca feminine side\u201d. In short, the only good in men, according to most discourse reflected and propagated in mass media, are traits alleged to be female. Maleness is widely represented as innately and culturally evil, and characteristics of masculinity are principally portrayed as undesirable and anachronistic \u2013 notably aggression, violence, sexual predaciousness and promiscuity, competitiveness and traditional body image. [...]\n\nQualitative analysis also conducted as part of this study shows highly negative messages concerning men and male identity are communicated through  influential \u2018quality\u2019 media as well as \u2018popular\u2019 press (University of Queensland, 1992); are contributed by credible sources such as academics and best-selling authors (see Figure 23); and are couched in semiotically significant (ie. persuasive) language as shown in chapter five. In-depth text analysis techniques reveal that, tonally, mass media content frequently includes highly critical and even vitriolic attacks on men and male identity, and balance is not provided through oppositional (ie. male supportive) views in all but a few cases. Analysis confirms bias against men in key areas of discourse in both quantitative and qualitative terms.\n\nIt can be concluded from this study that men are widely demonised, marginalised, trivialised and objectified in mass media. These findings support and expand those of Nathanson and Young (2001) and others who have reported \u201cmisandry\u201d and denigration of men in modern societies.  [...]\n\nGeneralisations [...] such as women are better communicators than men and claims that the world would be peaceful and a better place if women were in charge, are allowed to pass unchallenged in popular and in academic discourse reported in mass media. Statements of superiority in reverse (ie. suggestions that men are better than women) are defined as sexism and viewed as \u2018politically incorrect\u2019 and even illegal in some cases. This analysis shows that gender discrimination in language and discourse cited by Weatherall (2002) has reversed, or at least applies to both genders.\n\n\n**On Academia:**\n\nA significant number of mass media articles contributed by writers external to the media on subjects such as domestic violence and fatherhood indicate that  viewpoints propagated on these subjects are reflective of at least some elements of society. In particular, analysis of sources contributing the most negative discourse on men and male identity suggests that these views are reflective of intellectual and academic thinking. [...]  In this sense, mass media cannot be \u2018blamed\u2019 for the views expressed and one must consider the implications of these negative views of men being held in societies. That highly negative views of men are held within intellectual and academic fields is potentially of more concern than the potential for mass media communication of these views to influence society, as it indicates that these attitudes already exist and that they exist at an influential level. University lecturers, trainers, writers and senior political appointees frame education and social and political policy for future generations.\n\n**Similar findings:**\n\nWoods (1999) says that \u201cthe hegemonic discourse of the \u2018flawed male\u2019 can only lead to the experience of social exclusion for many young men, an experience that is known to lead to disastrous consequences for the well-being of individuals and communities\u201d.\n\nMacdonald et al. (2000) conclude from their studies: \u201cWe would suggest that there is a strong element of negativity in our culture about men which cannot contribute to positive mental health and we must actively pursue cultural  initiatives which promote in boys and men a positive sense of self\u201d.\n\n**And feminism:**\n\nGiven the celebratory tone of feminism towards being a woman and femininity, this suggests that being a woman is a laudable accomplishment, a source of  pride. But the widespread criticism and at times vitriolic attacks on men and masculinity suggest that being a man\/male is a failing and a cause for shame.\n\nViews such as that of Ferguson, and pro-feminist writers such as Webb (1998) who claims that traditional masculinity is redundant and needs to be \u201cjunked\u201d, fall into the trap of generalising and are extreme in that they recognise no good in men or masculinity at all. This is a position also taken by pro-feminist academics such as Connell (1995a) and Edgar (1998) who urge men to discard traditional masculinity and evolve instead to feminist-dominated gender studies notions of what they should be \u2013 usually involving, as Edgar\u2019s concluding chapter title says \u201cReshaping masculinity\u201d.\n\nSignificantly, feminism has not denounced any of the wide range of femininities that exist and, instead, advocates that women can be whatever they want to be \u2013 wives, careerists, jet fighter pilots, astronauts, strippers, prostitutes, or \u2018girlies\u2019 wearing mini-skirts and boas. Third Wave feminism has celebrated traditional feminine values and traits as well as opened up new \u2018narratives of the self\u2019 for women. However, widely propagated discourse tells men that they need to totally discard traditional masculinities and be \u201creconstructed\u201d.\n\nDiscourse suggests that women can be whatever they want to be; men have to be what feminist-dominated discourses dictate they should be, affording them limited possibilities and denying them self-determination and autonomy as individuals. This position is in conflict with the philosophy of choice widely advanced in feminist gender theory. If men are to be \u2018liberated\u2019 and afforded the same autonomy that women claim, they need to be allowed to be what they want to be. Imperfect that may be at times, but social equity suggests that men should be allowed to write themselves into existence and be given voice in the discourse that forms the scripts that other men use to write themselves into existence.","title":"The Dominant Culture view of Men as represented by Media Portrayal ~ Excerpts from recent research (2006)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/26qhgd\/the_dominant_culture_view_of_men_as_represented\/","upvote_ratio":0.78,"over_18":false}

Blue openly uses her platform to lure high school boys for profit under the guise of empowerment. While this has drawn criticism, it remains an exception in how female predators are typically addressed.  \n\nIf a 25-year-old man openly sought high school girls to create explicit content, the response would be swift and absolute, with calls for immediate action. Yet, when Bonnie Blue targets high school boys, there is hesitation to label her actions as predatory. Society often clings to outdated beliefs that women aren\u2019t capable of abuse or that male victims aren\u2019t truly harmed. This double standard not only excuses female predators but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about men and abuse.  \n\nThe myth that men are less affected by abuse silences male victims and normalizes exploitative behavior when the perpetrator is a woman. High school boys, while technically adults, are still vulnerable to manipulation due to their social and emotional immaturity. Blue\u2019s actions\u2014targeting a high school setting and profiting from the inexperience of these boys\u2014demonstrate clear predatory behavior, yet the societal response has been muted compared to similar actions by male offenders.  \n\nSome defend her behavior as \u201cempowering,\u201d but exploitation is not empowerment. True empowerment involves ethical, consensual relationships\u2014not targeting vulnerable young people for personal gain. Dismissing predatory actions under the guise of empowerment does a disservice to victims and undermines efforts to hold all abusers accountable.  \n\nThis case exemplifies a larger problem: society\u2019s failure to confront female-perpetrated sexual abuse unless it is overt and undeniable. Male victims face additional barriers to being taken seriously, as the cultural narrative still struggles to acknowledge that women can be abusers. Recognizing abuse shouldn\u2019t depend on the gender of the perpetrator\u2014it should depend on the harm caused to the victim.  \n\nIf we want to protect all victims and create a consistent standard of accountability, we must stop excusing female predators or treating their actions as less harmful. Abuse is abuse, regardless of the perpetrator\u2019s gender. Only by addressing these biases can we ensure justice for all victims and hold all predators to the same standard.

To summarize his main point in my own words:  Many reports of rape (about 25% to 50%, depending on the source) do not lead to further investigation or a trial.  This is because good evidence in such cases is often hard to come by.  There are rarely any witnesses, and circumstantial evidence can be ambiguous.\n\nThis is of course very unfortunate for the victims of rape, but there is another related problem:  Proving that a crime did *not* happen is similarly difficult.  So, basically, there are three groups of cases:\n1. Those where there is evidence supporting the allegation.\n2. Those where there is evidence *against* the allegation.\n3. Those where there is insufficient evidence in either direction.\n\nConventionally (cf. the study by Lisak et al. that the author cites, which appears to be one of the most-cited ones concerning the issue), the ratio of false allegations is computed by dividing the cases in group 2 by the total number of reported cases.  That is where we get the single-digit percentages from.\n\nTo me, therefore, the term \"false allegations\" as is usually used is a misnomer; it should be called \"proven-false allegations\" to account for the fact that in, again, a significant proportion of cases, it is simply not known whether they are true or false.  For those, we can only speculate.\n\nHere, we should take into account that false allegations can ruin someone's life even if they do not result in a conviction; getting the police to interview people in someone's social environment is usually enough, and some good acting skills should be sufficient for that.\n\nAlso, the statistics are usually based on police data only; they do not even account for those cases from group 1 that result in an acquittal, making that group seem larger than it should be.\n\nIn the end, it is just like author says:  *We do not know the rate of false allegations.*  The figures usually given are mere lower estimates based on police data... which one might consider fine if we were not simultaneously told to believe the \"1 in 4\" statistics concerning the prevalence of rape.","title":"\"False allegations of rape: the true extent remains unknown.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/10el6dr\/false_allegations_of_rape_the_true_extent_remains\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

Matos highlights 3 \"key points\":\n\n* Dating opportunities for heterosexual men are diminishing as relationship standards rise.\n* Men represent approximately 62% of dating app users, lowering their chances for matches.\n* Men need to address skills deficits to meet healthier relationship expectations.\n\nAnd cites two studies:\n\n* [Loneliness Around the World: Age, gender, and cultural differences in loneliness](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0191886920302555) (Barreto et al 2021 in *Personality and Individual Differences* based on the BBC Loneliness Experiment)\n* [Rising Share of U.S. Adults Are Living Without a Spouse or Partner](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2021\/10\/05\/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner) (Pew analysis of census \/ American Community Survey data)\n\n**Do the cited studies support Matos' points?**\n\nBarreto et al indeed find that \"Men reported more loneliness than women.\" However, they caution that other studies such as [ONS 2018](https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/wellbeing\/articles\/lonelinesswhatcharacteristicsandcircumstancesareassociatedwithfeelinglonely\/2018-04-10) found the opposite, and others such as [Maes et al 2019](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1002\/per.2220) found no gender differences. Barreto et al stress \"that the effects we found were very small\" and \"that loneliness is a fairly universal experience across demographic categories\". Overall, the literature is mixed on how loneliness interacts with gender (and how age affects this interaction).\n\nPew found that [young (aged 25-54) men are now 3% less likely than young women to live with a partner in the US](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2021\/10\/05\/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner\/pst_10-05-21_unpartnered_adults-0-2\/). This effect is, again, rather small, but we might wonder why men's and women's rates of cohabitation began to differ.\n\nIf Matos' reasoning - that women's increasing standards are driving male loneliness - is right, then why are fewer men living with a partner but the same trend isn't seen among women? Are women partnering with other women instead, or living in polyamorous households with a smaller number of men? According to [US Census historical tables](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/data\/tables\/time-series\/demo\/same-sex-couples\/ssc-house-characteristics.html), the number of F+F married households did increase more rapidly than the number of M+M married households from 2005-2019. The number of unmarried couples cohabiting with a same-sex partner, however, remains about equal between US men and women. If bisexual women are increasingly living with female partners due to a paucity of suitable men, then it is mysterious why this would be the case only for married couples. It could be caused by different marriage and cohabitation trends between gay and lesbian couples. (I equivocate gender and sex here because the distinction isn't that important in this context; and assume that polyamorous households are not statistically significant).\n\nAccording to UK [ONS data (table 6)](https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/birthsdeathsandmarriages\/families\/datasets\/familiesandhouseholdsfamiliesandhouseholds), young (aged 25-44) men were already almost twice as likely to live alone as young women in 2005, and the proportion did not change much since then. While this data doesn't distinguish living with parents or friends from living with a partner, it suggests that there is not a significant increase in UK men living alone due to inability to meet women's standards.\n\n**How does this Psychology Today article compare to others on the topic of loneliness?**\n\nOther articles on loneliness frame it as a social problem, emphasize the harms wrought by this condition, and encourage readers to reach out to others to help mitigate your and their loneliness. PT's [loneliness page](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/basics\/loneliness) describes the subjective experience and health costs of loneliness. [Mindfulness for the Lonely](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/sexual-mindfulness\/202208\/mindfulness-the-lonely) gives gender-neutral coping strategies and empathy. [Combating the Pandemic of Loneliness](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/the-meaningful-life\/202208\/combating-the-pandemic-loneliness) suggests \"extending beyond ourselves and connecting meaningfully with others, especially those who are lonely and may have lost hope in themselves and humanity\". [How to Address the New Loneliness](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/why-bad-looks-good\/202207\/how-address-the-new-loneliness) exhorts us to \"reach out to those with whom we lost contact during the pandemic\". [Loneliness Poses Greater Public Health Threat Than Obesity](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/the-squeaky-wheel\/201708\/loneliness-poses-greater-public-health-threat-obesity) reminds readers that \"We can reach out, call, visit, and include them in activities and get-togethers. We can initiate deeper, more meaningful conversations and make them feel seen and loved\", in addition to suggesting neighborhood and community based approaches. [An Important Factor That Protects Against Loneliness ](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/finding-new-home\/202208\/important-factor-protects-against-loneliness) suggests that purpose protects against loneliness, and encourages self-reflection as a prevention and coping strategy.\n\nMatos' article resembles some of these in that it proposes coping strategies. But unlike the others, where speculations about the causes of loneliness are grounded in the stated results of cited scientific studies, Matos offers no evidence (other than small gender gaps in loneliness and cohabitation) for his key points about a skills deficit and rising relationship standards. **Is there evidence for these points that he could have cited to bolster his argument?**\n\nAlso notably absent are empathy for ~~victims~~ lonely people, descriptions of their lived experiences, and framing as a public health issue. Could these differences be related to the fact that loneliness is here framed as a men's issue? **By asking men to solve their own problems, does Matos unwittingly promote toxic masculinity, stereotypes about men, and\/or male disposability?**\n\n>Level up your mental health game. That means getting into some individual therapy to address your skills gap. It means valuing your own internal world and respecting your ideas enough to communicate them effectively. It means seeing intimacy, romance, and emotional connection as worthy of your time and effort.\n\nWhile it grates to presume all male readers suffer from a skills gap, is there a kernel of truth to the stereotype? **Is this sensible, practical advice to anyone (or perhaps only, or especially men?) struggling with loneliness, or is it too blamey?**","title":"The Rise of Lonely, Single Men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/wqifwq\/the_rise_of_lonely_single_men\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

I have in mind typical feminist policy proposals that justify discrimination based on observed differences in outcomes between men & women *as groups*. I follow normal nomenclature & call this Equality of Outcome. While there are formulations of Equality of Outcome that apply to individuals rather than groups these aren\u2019t seen in practice (for very good reasons) and I don\u2019t address them here.\n\n**1.** **Equality of Outcome is unfair & unpopular**\n\nHow would you feel if you were told that you couldn\u2019t do engineering because you are the wrong gender? Or that you deserve a promotion but you won\u2019t get it because of quotas? EoOut offends innate standards of fairness & justice. An increasing number of people really detest it.\n\n**2.** **Equality of Outcome is inherently discriminatory**\n\nAs I write, I can see a local university through my window. If I apply for entry to a STEM course there, then I get classified as a man & my entrance score is adjusted down. To pick another example if I apply for the state unemployment benefit, I will be classified as a man & told it\u2019s not available to me. In these & other cases, one\u2019s rights & privileges are determined by which group you fall into. This is, by definition, discrimination.\n\nSome might think that the difference between EoOut & equality (of opportunity) is minor & marginal. Nothing could be further from the truth - EoOut & equality are complete opposites.\n\n**3.** **So many outcomes to choose from**\n\nI\u2019ve done some deep dives lately on a few EoOut proposals & I can report back that there are *always* statistics to be found to back up your chosen narrative. There will *always* be a way to slice & dice the numbers to prove that women are disadvantaged (especially if no one looks closely). In reality the formal requirement for finding a difference in outcome before invoking discrimination can always be satisfied.\n\n**4.** **And the best lobbyists win**\n\nIn the 1980s, the public\u2019s attention was drawn to images of young harp seal pups being clubbed to death for their fur. These pups looked small & vulnerable, they had cuddly soft fur & big doe eyes. There was an international outcry though they weren\u2019t actually endangered. Meanwhile the Pacific Flower barnacle went extinct \u2013 largely because of human pollution. And no one cared.\n\nEveryone wants to help women & that may have been feminism\u2019s greatest asset. And that asset has been parlayed into government support, generous funding & access to the corridors of power - further increasing feminism\u2019s lobbying power. Combined with the fact that feminists can always find some stat to show disadvantage (see previous point) the result is that \u201cEquality of Outcome\u201d is driven by lobbying muscle rather than outcomes.\n\n**5.** **There\u2019s only so much sympathy to go around**\n\nTo benefit from EoOut one\u2019s group needs to get sympathy, support and a measure of power. While, in principle, EoOut might be available to any group (even men), the inescapable reality is that will never happen. Only some groups have the lobbying muscle to benefit from EoO and those groups gather privilege in proportion to their lobbying power. The end result is a modern caste system with women at the top, probably some skin colours\/races\/ethnicities in the middle (depending on country) & white men at the bottom. Groups at the top attract increasing privilege & those at the bottom increasing discrimination.\n\nEoOut isn\u2019t just discriminatory, it\u2019s oppressive.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf you accept just one of my points you should oppose Equality of Outcome.\n\n  \n\nEDIT: A number of comments have taken exception to my applying the term \u201cEquality of Outcome\u201d to feminist arguments around equality. My terminology is correct but, like the comments, that\u2019s beside the point. My arguments in this post address the reality of feminist ideology & they stand regardless of the terminology used. Feel free to substitute your preferred term where I use EoOut - my points still apply.","title":"A Critique of Feminist Equality","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/nsp55a\/a_critique_of_feminist_equality\/","upvote_ratio":0.81,"over_18":false}

Nevertheless, this question has been baffling me for quite a while, so I would like to hear your opinions.\n\nBeside \"toxic masculinity\", it is now also \"traditional masculinity\" that is under a lot of attack.  It is said that we need to overcome traditional stereotypes in order to fight misogyny.  But what is \"traditional masculinity\"?  It probably varies from place to place, but the West has largely adopted the (probably originally British) idea of \"being a gentleman\".  Now what is rule no. 1 for gentlemen?  From my understanding, it is: \"Be kind to women.\"\n\nCertainly people are bigoted:  A \"traditional\" man will hold the door for a woman on a date, but after marriage, he may still expect her to pick up his smelly socks from the floor.  Also, feminists might argue that holding the door for a woman is rather insulting than kind, but I think this can be interpreted as a \"cultural misunderstanding\" about manners.  In any case, the message \"Be kind to women\" still stands.\n\nSo when people ascribe things like street harassment to traditional masculinity, I am always confused because I do not think that this is what traditional masculinity teaches what a gentleman should do.  Actually, it is quite the opposite:  In my view, feminism and traditional masculinity both formulate rules for men intending to improve the lives of women.  Sometimes these rules align (such as in the case of street harassment), sometimes they contradict (about, e.g., holding the door or not).  They certainly have very different ideas about gender roles, but the imperative of respecting women is the same.","title":"Is \"traditional masculinity\" actually hostile towards women?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/k6jcg8\/is_traditional_masculinity_actually_hostile\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

In it, the author discusses his experience of sexual abuse and calls out the harmful notion that women sexually abusing young boys is \"making them into men\"\n\nIt's a good premise overall. And yet, every now and then there're still these typical presumptions of \"male privilege\" and \"women's suffering not being acknowledged\". It's as if lately there are far too many instances of women raping men and boys coming to light for people to completely ignore the matter. So instead it's addressed in the only way that doesn't challenge the narrative that sexual violence is still ultimately the fault of men\n\nThis is not the first time where more blame was put on the people who *downplayed* the abuse (the \"toxic masculinity\", as it's called) than on the women who actually *committed* the abuse. This way, instead of recognizing abusive women and holding them accountable for the role these women play in the problem of sexual violence in society, it's turned into 'men are to blame, for thinking women are weak'. It's as if the only way for discussing female-on-male rape to be palpable is if it's still ultimately reframed to reinforce the notions of male = abuser, female = victim\n\n>the timeworn male terrorism that so subconsciously figures a woman\u2019s humanity and suffering as inherently of less value than a man\u2019s.\n\nWhat planet does he live on where women's suffering is counted less than a man's? It's almost always the opposite. He says \n>I must listen from my position of male privilege, even with what happened to me. The blame for what occurred when I was fifteen will never be on 'what I was wearing', how I 'lead someone on', or the 'amount of drinks I had.'\n\njust before saying \n>...only one person defined my circumstance as borderline rape. I, in heterosexual contact initiated by a woman, could not possibly have been abused, because a man of any libido could never experience rape at the hands of a woman\n\nIndeed, instead of being asked \"what were you wearing?\" male victims are told \"you can't be raped by a woman\", but I fail to see how the latter is a position of \"male privilege\"\n\nIt's also ironic when he says\n>When addressed, a common way to assess these acts\u2019 severity is to invoke the \"daughter or wife clause\", wherein an accusation of rape and sexual assault immediately gains an emotional heft and credibility after a man puts forward the notion of violence befalling the women in his life (his women)\n\nand uses it as evidence that men don't have real empathy for women: \"'to my daughter or wife' is an attempt at empathy, but linguistically sells us all short, as if the only way we can feel for victims is to centralize ourselves, particularly as men\"\n\nCompletely glazing over the fact that sexual violence that befalls **any** man or boy will generally be ignored. There isn't even this \"imagine if it happened to your son or husband\", because there's no significant discourse discussing the social issue of sexual violence against men at all. People don't consider the problem of sexual violence befalling any man they know, despite how often it happens; sexual violence is always made about women, just like it is in this article\n\nIt's like he's shooting himself in the foot. He recognizes what happens to him as abuse and he does *call out one* of the problems (society's tendency to say men \/ boys can't be raped by women because guys are always willing) while *embracing the other* problem of why female-on-male sexual abuse is marginalized: sexual abuse is often framed as a women's issue that men don't suffer comparably from (due to either supposed infrequency or their supposed advantage from \"male privilege\") and that men and masculinity are ultimately responsible for \n\nIn this way, even when the discussion is about male victims of female perpetrators, it manages to marginalize them in the exact way it speaks against. It's like **'this happened to me and some other boys; it was awful; and society basically ignored it because I'm a boy and they were women. But don't forget that men raping women is a bigger problem that deserves more attention\"** Like, \"yeah, that kind of thinking is a big part of why you were ignored in the first place: the idea that the sexual violence against women is inherently the primary concern\" ","title":"How the current sexual violence discourse silences male victims, even while discussing them","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/7f5ofg\/how_the_current_sexual_violence_discourse\/","upvote_ratio":0.82,"over_18":false}

But [there is a study](http:\/\/pubpages.unh.edu\/~mas2\/ID45-PR45.pdf) that found that men reported being sexually coerced \/ forced by their partners at higher rates in cultures where women held higher status. Assuming most men are heterosexual, that would imply that women rape their partners more in societies where they were generally less subjugated and already had power\n\nAnd it seems to be that the whole \"emotional connection\" thing is a matter of perspective: a man texts an under-aged girl that he loves and wants a relationship with her, and people say he's of course lying and grooming her. A woman does the same, and now it's proof that she actually loved the boy and is seeking a real connection\n\nNot to mention that lately at least there have been many cases in the news where the women sexually abused multiple boys, so even serial offending by women is not very uncommon\n\nI wouldn't call the gender stereotypes that restrict and harm both males and females to be the patriarchy, but I do agree that society's tendency to see women as lacking sexual agency, to subscribe all sexual expression from women as romantic, and the assertion that all men and boys should be constantly driven by a desire for sex with every available woman to be a significant factor in why people can't see female sex predators as actual predators\n\nI think the second to the last paragraph especially hits the mark. There have already been books and films etc. of women like this, instead portrayed either as victims themselves or as romantic characters.

It is *absolutely impossible* to seriously discuss female sexual objectification without at least *acknowledging* the large numbers of women who deliberately and cheerfully objectify themselves that way, and the many more than that who secretly to not-so-secretly clearly would be willing to BE objectified if only they could be so beautiful they could bring strong men to to their knees in exchange for it.\n\n3.

The article laments the lack of racial diversity in the book industry, and then goes on to mention a \"bright spot\" in the survey results: the gender composition, \"which leans heavily away from men\/cis men [21%] and toward women\/cis women [78%]\". They also lament the fact that 40% of executives are male, as if this is too high.\n\nWe have a lack of gender diversity in the book industry.

Common explanations: different biological inclinations and traits (frequently from the traditionalist side), discrimination and discouragement (frequently from the feminist side). Let's set those aside for the moment and look at a third possible contributing factor.\n\n**Idea & Question**\n\nI think I can safely say that the way we raise\/socialize men and women is different; on average, we're more likely to take a \"tough love\" approach to men but a coddling approach to women. When women express weakness or sensitivity we're more likely to indulge them or cater to them, while when men do it we're more likely to tell them to get over it, resulting in men being tougher and women being more sensitive (on average). Would anyone disagree here?\n\nAnd a lot of the positions where women are less common are jobs that are tough (mentally and\/or physically), high-pressure, and high stress. Are we harming women's chances of breaking into these fields by the way we socialize them? Would raising\/socializing women with more tough love and less coddling make them better able to succeed in many male-dominated areas? Should we do this?\n\n**Examples**\n\nLook at [this](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/3n2m24\/men_in_maledominated_fields_what_do_you_think_are\/) AskMen thread \"Men in male-dominated fields, what do you think are the reasons why there aren't many women in your profession?\". One reply:\n\n> My highly unpopular opinion : because it's a competitive field where you'll only be good if you sacrifice a lot\n> It seems to me that men represent the majority of people who are ready to live an unbalanced life\n\nAnother:\n\n> It's a tough job with long hours, amd extended periods away from family, you will get told what to do and it doesn't matter if you don't want to do it sometimes, it's your job.\n\nAnother:\n\n> The hours and competition.\n\nAnother:\n\n> They don't have the same amazingly low standards of personal hygiene that you need to cope with the conditions. They don't get the same rush from the pain and difficulty that keeps many of us trying even though we know we are killing ourselves.\n\nAnd it goes on. Some responses were about discrimination, teaching genders to go in different directions, and biological differences, but this is a common one.\n\n******\n\n**Additional note**\n\nYou might be thinking that this is part of the feminist critique about socializing men and women differently, but more often I see them talking about women's socialization discouraging them from those fields. I'm talking about women's socialization making them less able to succeed in those fields (and how to fix it). (*Maybe* the \"Lean In\" stuff gets closer to what I'm talking about, from the little I've read of it.)\n\nRemember Tim Hunt on women in science [crying when they get criticized](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tim_Hunt#Remarks_about_women_in_science)? That's more of what I'm getting at. Does coddling women make them more likely to take criticism badly? Most feminists that I saw reacted to this by rejecting the possibility and calling him misogynist, not by saying \"maybe it's true and we should socialize women to be tougher\". That's why I'm not considering my point here to be the same as the most common feminist critique. Also, in addition to not challenging this, I think that the approach taken by many feminists actually encourages it (someone's less likely to be a tough woman who makes it to the top if she gets offended a lot and lets that affect her; it's the same with a tough man who makes it to the top).","title":"Raising\/socializing women with more \"tough love\" and less coddling to help them succeed in male-dominated fields","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/3n3pwq\/raisingsocializing_women_with_more_tough_love_and\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

I believe there are actually two, and I hope to lay out these in this post. I believe a lot of discourse around women and men's relationships sexually and romantically would be improved if this was recognized. Obviously, people buy into these to various degrees, but I do believe that one cannot hold both without severe dissonance. Before elaborating on this, let me lay out the two models:\n\n**Model A:** This is what I think feminists tend to think the vast majority men are taught, while in fact only *some* men are taught it and internalize it. \n\nIn this model, men are supposed to be strong, powerful, have sex with lots of women, and deserving of dominance. Women are objectified as lesser, childlike, and only useful to be fucked. A man who cannot have his way with women is weak and a failure. Once married, the man views himself as the dictator of the house. His wife submits to his whims, and if she doesn't, he's weak and a failure. Men who internalize this model are more likely to sexually harass women, have sex mostly for the \"notches on the bedpost\" and the social status, not care about a woman's pleasure except as a means of building up his own ego and social status, view themselves as deserving of dominance in relationships, and to ignore the lack of consent. Not all the men who ascribe tot this model do those things, but my hunch is they're strongly correlated. \n\nThis model also hurts the men as it puts immense pressures on them. If they fail to meet these pressures, they are emasculated and mocked. Their entire sense of self-worth rests on a precarious foundation.\n\nThe men who internalize this model rarely suffer from difficulties expressing romantic or sexual interest, however. These men are also much less likely to be taken advantage of by women or to be abused by women. \n\n**Model B:** This model is one that I was largely taught and internalized, and one that I see in many others. It seems like this is the model that is very common among the kind of geeky intellectual men who tend to be interested in gender issues. I also think a lot of men who grow up in strongly feminist influenced environments internalize this. I think most men on Reddit in general have internalized this model, IME.\n\nIn this model, men are average and default, while women are special and superior. The default women is moral, caring, empathetic, down-to-earth, common-sensical, sexy, desirable, and so on. Her sexuality is desirable, beautiful, empowering, and intense. Meanwhile, the default man is base, unempathetic, selfish, uncaring, gross, non-sexy, oppressive, unsophisticated, lacking common-sense, and so on. His sexuality is inherently humorous, undesirable, and gross at best, and dangerous and violating at worst. Thus, a man must prove he is worthy enough for a woman to deign to have sex and\/or enter a relationship with him, and he should be grateful and very generous in that case.\n\nMen who internalize this model will tend to idolize women, and have low self-esteem around their gender. These men tend to be intimidated by women and actually are somewhat submissive to women in their daily lives. They are more likely to be Nice Guy TMs, or to engage in white knight behavior to win women over. They are also more likely to think that many of their personal problems would be fixed if they somehow got into a relationship. Sexually, if they manage to find willing sexual partners, they are more likely to have poor boundaries and to have sex where they give far more than they get (e.g. 30 minutes of eating a woman out and then 5 minutes of starfish PiV). These men are much more likely to have difficulties finding sexual and\/or romantic partners than other men. They feel ashamed to express their sexuality and desire explicitly, and they feel inherently undesirable themselves as men. These men feel oppressed, and not wholly irrationally.\n\nThe lack of boundaries, the lack of expressing desire, the low self-esteem, the idolization of women, actually hurts women, too. If they are in a relationship with these men, they are tasked with all the emotional labor by being forced to infer or tease out their partner's desires and boundaries. There is also a great deal of pressure to be perfect put on women by the idolization.\n\nThe men who internalize this are much less likely to abuse women or engage in the nastier sorts of sexism.\n\n\nI believe these two models can explain a lot about gender discourse. It can explain many misunderstandings between feminists and non-feminist men--see the Scott Aaronson debate from a few months back, for example--because both sides think there is one predominant model, when there are two. The feminists think the vast majority of men are taught model A, while the non-feminists that sympathized with Aaronson who were taught model B themselves, though they acknowledge that some men are taught model A, *underestimate* how many men actually have internalized model A. The Red Pill can be seen as model A being recast as an empowering life philosophy for men who were taught model B, and PUA as a less extreme version of that. A great deal of MRA discussions of gender dynamics in sexual and relational matters comes from the perspective of men who were taught model B. And so on.\n\nI personally feel like acknowledging this distinction is important. I've often felt invisible as somebody who was taught and internalized model B, especially when reading and interacting with feminists. I also feel like men who are taught and internalized model B are oppressed in a certain sense. At the same time, I think men like me can sometimes lose sight of how common things like street harassment are for most women.","title":"There are *two* mutually (exclusive) toxic traditional models of how men should relate to women sexually and in relationships that are taught to young men, rather than one hegemonic model.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/36xrle\/there_are_two_mutually_exclusive_toxic\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

It doesn't seem to avoid the nasty bits (e.g. men committing most violent crime).  At the same point the author simultaneously notes her gendered expectations re: who does the childcare while acknowledging increased male interest here:\n\n> About a third of the Spanish responses were from young men, which surprised me since I don\u2019t know anyone with a male childminder \u2013 or \u201cmanny\u201d as they are sometimes called. Looking back at my ad, I noticed that, unlike the other families who posted, I hadn\u2019t specified that I wanted a woman because, well, that would have been sexist. But make no mistake, in my head \u201cchildminder\u201d meant \u201cfemale.\u201d\n\nThe author found a male candidate to be the most appropriate caretaker after doing her interviews and then noted:\n\n> I\u2019d be lying, though, if I said the notion of a male carer didn\u2019t give me significant pause. It wasn\u2019t that I had anything against the idea \u2013 it\u2019s just that I\u2019d never imagined it. And because of this, something about it made me uncomfortable. These moments when we come face to face with our own prejudices are instructive, aren\u2019t they? When I hit that roadblock in my two-way street of equality, I was shocked by my own knee-jerk sexism.\n\n> When I asked the Internet \u201cShould I hire a manny?\u201d I came upon message board after message board on the subject, with comments from mothers such as \u201cAbsolutely not. Any man who would consider such a job would have to be weird,\u201d and \u201cOf course! Provided he was young and buff. Ha ha.\u201d\n\nLastly, this bit at the end reminded me a bit of women in certain areas often being assumed to be, e.g., a secretary or in PR rather than an executive or in an engineering role:\n\n> It was also rather gratifying when another mother remarked to me in the park last week that she\u2019d met my \u201chusband\u201d at toddler swim class, and that he seemed \u201cvery nice.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother telling her that I\u2019m not actually married to a 23-year-old Spanish guy. Let\u2019s just call it one of the unexpected benefits of having a manny.\n\nIt seems also worth noting that the author seems to see her actions here as living up to her feminist ideals.  This is not an anti-feminist hit piece:\n> if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s usually driving fast and furiously on the woman side, it\u2019s interesting to encounter an unexpected roadblock in the man lane \u2013 one that makes you question your own feminist ideals.\n\nOverall I found myself wishing more articles were written with a tone like this one.","title":"\"Facing the decision to hire a male nanny gave me pause\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2y1jgc\/facing_the_decision_to_hire_a_male_nanny_gave_me\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

So it seems natural to ask if the opposite has ever occurred, and if not whether there is something that makes masculinity particularly vulnerable to fall into crisis. In the following I want to talk about what I think are the origins of this crisis of masculinity, and I argue that there is indeed such a biological asymmetry between men and women.\n\nThere is an expectation that masculinity is something that has to be \"earned\". A girl matures into a woman, while the transition from boy to man is often portrayed to be more of an ordeal based on hardships with the goal to achieve fame and social standing or to preserve some ideal for society's greater good. Masculinity is also described as something that can be taken away, a man can be \"emasculated\" while there is no similar word for women, and masculinity is frequently sought to be reinforced. Similarly, there is no shortage of terms to disparage feminine qualities in men, and more recently to shame men for not adhering to an adequate version of masculinity (see e.g. 'toxic masculinity').\n\nMasculinity, or so I have seen it stated, is very fragile. There are many other ways this manifests, and the shame men feel at inadequately filling their social role, particularly if this inadequacy is expressed by women, has been exploited e.g. during WW1 and briefly during WW2 as part of the White Feather Campaign to shame men as cowards and pacifists by certain women handing out feathers to men not in uniform. It has been noted that men subject to being \"white feathered\" have been scarred for life, demonstrating how uncomfortable men are at female disapproval, sometimes to the surprise of women.\n\nAnother example is the shaming of men's bodies, be it about the 'inadequate' size of his member or his height, which is seen as little more than 'humor' or 'entertainment' when at the same time it would be viewed as inadequate to make similar comments about a woman (e.g. about her breast size or body weight).\n\nI have tried to explain this effect in the past on [this post](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/LeftWingMaleAdvocates\/comments\/p32qit\/toward_a_new_theory_of_gender_an_evolutionary\/), so let me quote myself:\n\n>When you look at the differences between the sexes, you may note the male's greater relative physical strength and the absence of monthly periods, and the female's ability to lactate and bear children. On first sight, these differences might compensate each other, but arguably, the female sex plays a more vital role in the preservation of the human species as the number of females in a given population limits its reproduction rate; to frame it more drastically, men are the expendable sex.  \n>  \n>Men's ability to father multiple children with less expenditure but also their resulting lower sexual market-value (abundance of resource decreases market value) and women's greater long-term investment and expenditure while performing the reproductive function (need for protection and provision) lead to the expectation for men to differentiate themselves from the desired & passive sex (female) by becoming the performative, competitive & desiring sex (male). That is, masculinity is *traditionally* defined by its differentiation from femininity, and hence also its inflexibility (femininity is only constrained as a secondary effect to allow the male to differentiate himself and thus enjoys greater flexibility).  \n>  \n>The difference between the sexes drives the need of the male to differentiate himself from the female through feats and achievements, and is arguably the reason men are perceived to be hyper-agentic \/ hyper-accountable (responsible for both their success and suffering) and women are perceived to be hypo-agentic \/ hypo-accountable (not quite as responsible for their success and helpless victims of their circumstances).  \n>  \n>\\[\u2026\\]  \n>  \n>Notice also how women are not mocked for presenting femininely. Instead, behind this bias lies the idea that men can never truly be women or fill a woman's role which results in the greater rigidity of the male gender role. There is a societal tendency to punish men for deviating from their social roles. Holding men to these social roles which are detrimental to the individual but beneficial to the group interest, like engaging in dangerous work to procure resources and providing protection to women and children, is done through disparaging feminine qualities in men; at the psychological level, this manifests as ridicule and hostility for trying to pass off as aristocratic without his blue blood diploma, for he can never attain what makes it unnecessary for the female to participate in the masculine competitive culture that is glorified in human civilizations as a social bribe for men to risk their own well-being in return for resources to attract opposite-sex partners.\n\nAdditionally, it is not women who try to earn men's love by improving themselves through physical exercise and monetary offerings, it is men who do these things as a result of the unequal nature at which men and women desire each other (lest the man is blessed with particularly good looks or charisma that make women flock to him instead). MGTOW (and possibly similar movements) can be seen as an *attempt* to escape from this deeply-rooted need of women's approval and physical as well as emotional intimacy with them (and which is motivated not just by sexual longing but by an emotional bond which causes increased altruistic behavior towards female partners, sometimes even to the man's demise).\n\nWhat men need in women is less material, but rather emotional and sexual intimacy, as well as birthing and child raising. You can't as easily replace these roles. I allege that women's historically unprecedented independence, which is owed in part to the birth control pill and other technological advances and in part to the existence of a social welfare state, combined with men's dependence on women and their discomfort at female disapproval (and the resulting leverage that women have over men which many men go to great lengths to hide) lies at the heart of this crisis of masculinity. (Of course, I am ignoring at which cost this independence often comes and whether or not both men and women would be better served with a more scaled-back version of it, but that is something for another time.)\n\nSome might argue that we already do have a crisis of femininity alongside a crisis of masculinity. I am not taking a position on this, but if someone wants to endorse that view I would ask you to also talk about the scale of this crisis and compare it to the scale of the \"crisis of masculinity\".\n\nSo, has there ever been a crisis of femininity, e.g. when women were first allowed to enter the work force?","title":"Has there ever been a crisis of femininity?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/qb2h8s\/has_there_ever_been_a_crisis_of_femininity\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

You will not be surprised to see that more men and boys were killed than women and girls, given the numbers of each gender who cycle on roads. What I found interesting, however, was the proportion of drivers who chose to flee after killing a cyclist, depending on the victim's gender.\n\n27% of drivers who killed male cyclists fled, while only 22% of drivers who killed female cyclists did. Therefore, **drivers were 19% more likely to flee if the cyclist they killed was male** than if the victim was female.\n\nThis disparity is especially pronounced for younger cyclists (below age 35). 24% of drivers who killed boys and young men fled, while only 19% of drivers who killed girls and young women did. Therefore, **drivers were 29% more likely to flee if a young cyclist they killed was male** than if the victim was female.\n\nI'm not sure how to test for statistical significance here - I could apply the binomial test to each gender separately by taking the other gender's hit-and-run percentage as the null hypothesis, but I feel like there must be a way to test the distribution as a whole with both variables taken into account. The figure for young cyclists is probably not significant at the 95% level. Anyway in the interest of having a discussion, let's suppose there is a real effect here. Fleeing the scene inflicts an additional harm on the victim by delaying emergency aid. Why are drivers more likely to flee after killing a man or boy? Here are some possible explanations:\n\n* Drivers care more about female lives than about male lives.\n* Drivers are more likely to flee after a serious accident when they feel they weren't at fault; and due to stereotypes (hyper- and hypo-agency) they wrongly attribute more blame to male cyclists than to female ones.\n* Drivers are more likely to flee after a serious accident when they feel they weren't at fault; and due to gendered risk behavior (tolerance and aversion) they correctly attribute more blame to male cyclists than to female ones.\n* Drivers are more likely to flee after a serious accident when they think the victim will survive; and due to stereotypes (physical strength and weakness) they over-estimate men's strength and women's weakness.\n* Drivers are more likely to flee after a serious accident on certain road types or neighborhoods on which men and boys happen to cycle more than women and girls.\n* Drivers are more likely to flee after a serious accident when they fear retaliation, and think that male cyclists are more likely to retaliate. (This seems unlikely for fatal accidents...)\n\nWhat do you think? Do any MRA's think risk-taking is mostly to blame; and do any feminists think driver bias is mostly to blame?","title":"Gender Analysis of 2020 Cycling Deaths","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/l8ztmu\/gender_analysis_of_2020_cycling_deaths\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

I assume most of you are familiar with incels, MGTOW, lookism, TRP, PUAs, and other off shoot ideologies that center around male\/female interactions. It seems as though dating gets the most talked about in men\u2019s circles, as opposed to other issues. This is due to the fact that romance and sex are arguably central to the human experience, but also because romance and sex are, to put it briefly, complex phenomena. This complexity, I believe, is the root of the dating problem today: despite romance and dating being complex phenomena, the cultural rules which govern these practices seem more muddled than ever.\n\nAfter talking to friend of mine about our dating struggles, the question of \u201cWhat makes a man attractive?\u201d came up and neither of us had deep answer to it. Obviously one can say that this answer is subjective, but from a cultural point of view. The problem is that I often see contradictions in words vs. actual mate choices, especially in regards to personality. Certain traits that would be deemed \u201ctoxic\u201d are often chosen as attractive: these could include the dark triad traits. Does the weight of personality only matter in regards to a man\u2019s attractiveness, or is this \u201cblackpilled\u201d take too reductive? \n\nI\u2019ve also found that many men do not know how to flirt, and more importantly how to recognize female flirting signals. Often times, female flirting signals are ambiguous, so there\u2019s always second guessing as a means to avoid rejection or worse be seen as a creep. The answer is to be more assertive, I suppose,  since assertive men are the ones who seem to be the most successful. Overall, how should we counsel men do avoid seeing themselves as perpetual creeps?\n\nIs straight male desire increasingly becoming more stigmatized?","title":"What advice should we give to men as they navigate the dating world?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/egihwu\/what_advice_should_we_give_to_men_as_they\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

Male infant circumcision:  I *never* liked this; I didn't like it even before there was really much of a public discussion that I was aware of (my oldest son is 21 years old, and right after his birth was the first time I ever really thought about it at all--my sexual experience prior to birthing him was very limited as to quantities of men, and I'm American which means, unsurprisingly, they were all circumcised men--I'm not even sure I really had a grasp on what a male foreskin *was* or what it might look like--unlike today's teenagers, I had no Internet to teach me these things).  So, MRAs were not responsible for my opposition to it; however, they definitely fed and watered that seed.\n\n* `2. Joint custody (both physical and legal) post-divorce:  Again, my views on this didn't originally spring from MRAs--I didn't think about it that much prior to my own first divorce, but it was so obvious to me that joint physical and legal custody (assuming  each parent actually wanted it for themselves--they don't, always) should be the default settlement that I was ripe fodder for agreeing with the MRAs I did subsequently end up encountering on the subject.\n\n* `3. Legal parental surrender: Now this one, I didn't really think about much before coming into contact with MRAs.  I didn't *oppose* it; I simply hadn't thought about it, not having any triggering life events in either my own or my friends' and families' lives to engage my thoughts on the subject.  However, it was pretty easy to agree with MRAs that it needed to be an option (though the devil *is* in the details on that one--though again, that never was a huge point of contention for me and the MRAs I discussed it with, as most of them agreed that while the *principle* was fair and obvious, how to *implement* it in the maximally just way for all parties was not necessarily so straightforward).  \n\n* `4. Paid parental leave: As with 1 and 2 above, this one I thought about long before I encountered any MRAs--neither I nor any spouse of mine has enjoyed paid parental leave, but we all sure could have used it!  Though, I take it a little farther--there are other reasons that *non*-parents could use dedicated paid leave to take care of family upheavals--my end point on this is, in the US, the FMLA needs to be revised to add some $$ to the mix.  As with LPS, the details (for me anyway) are negotiable and debatable, but the basic principle isn't.  \n\n* `5. Male-only draft:  My perspective on this has shifted all over the map, starting way back when I was a teen and enlisted in the military myself--at the time, I was pretty sympathetic to Heinlein's *Starship Troopers* proposal that only vets could be voters :) but I've backed pretty far off that extremism as an adult.  Part of the problem is, I struggle with the concept of the draft, period--I'd like to change it completely into something that only triggers when the war is of defense, on homeland soil--and I'd like military service to have *no* restrictions internally based on gender.  If I can have those things, then I want it to be gender-neutral as well.  If I can't have them, I just don't want the draft period.  \n\nHow about you?  Any opposing-gender ideologies that you incorporate in your preferred ideology?

Now, If you haven't Go and read this post. it is IMHO incredibly accurate\n\n\n\nBut to TL;DR what I think the core of the issue for nice guys is. \n\nFairy tale thinking and the demonization of male sexuality.\n\n\nnice guys are conditioned to believe that their sexuality is bad. and expressing sexual interest is both creepy and unattractive.\n\n\nThis is where we get the \"women only go after douchebags\" What makes these men douchebags? They're flirtatious, Masculine and forward with their desires. This is the opposite of what \"nice guy's\" know to be true. \n\n\nand in order to avoid rejection, They have to act in the \"gentlemanly\" way. That is to hide your desires and be extra courteous. This is why fedora's and M'lady's are such a common trope. Because they have that association with \"old school\" gentlemen.\n\nRobert Glover in his book. No More Mr, Nice Guy. States that the \"nice guy\" creed is something along the lines of. \n\nIf I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be then I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life. Do everything right, don't rock the boat, don't be a problem, hide your flaws and mistakes and you will get the love and approval you're after. The nice guy lives by this credo and if it is ineffective, he only tries harder.\n\nnow. After a few years of bitter rejection and loneliness after trying their hardest with what they know. \n\nEither that frustration, anger and eventually hatred. turns inwards. or it begins to flow outwards\n\nDirected inwards is How we come to the Incel crowd. \n\nYour thoughts eat at you. \"why am I not good enough\" \"I'm doing everything I was taught to do, Why am I not loved?\" \"maybe I'm just a less than human freak and this world is shit\" They just keep coming, Constantly gnawing and chewing. devouring you crumb by painful crumb. \n\nThis is why we see so much self hatred in the incel communities. They hate themselves for having been born into a life that in their eyes can only end in destitute loneliness. \n\nand yes, They focus on sex. But as much as we say otherwise, Sex and physical intimacy between human beings is an important interaction. \n\nThis is watered down for most people. And they're generally looking for a higher standard of desire. But ask any incel. and they would likely tell you that they would prefer an abusive relationship to none at all. This is also why most incels would not settle for a prostitute. \n\nwhat they're looking for isn't basic sex. It's what sex entails. That connection and acceptance. \n\nTrust issues are a big part as well. With the tirade of negative thoughts. it's hard to trust that people actually like you. Maybe they just stick around out of pity? I can tell you from experience that it's much worse when that has actually happened to you. \n\nI find it incredibly difficult to genuinely trust people.\n\nThen there's the last part to this triforce of terror. The Red Pill. \n\nI'm going to exclude cases where men have come to TRP due to negative experiences with relationships in the past. Because that is a significant part. \n\nWhat brings about the anger and hatred that people see in TRP. Is a feeling of being cheated and mislead. It's the feeling that the world doesn't want you to be successful. If it did, You wouldn't have been taught what you were in your youth. \n\nand one of the things that young men find in TRP groups first and foremost. is an outlet. They can scream and shout and complain as much as they want and nobody is going to give them trouble for it. I'm sure you've all seen what happens when they complain outside of that space.\n\nthis also means that the group is \"splintered\" ironically in many ways it's like feminism. You have your radicals. Rooshv for example. many people in TRP Dislike him. But the status quo of TRP groups is to live and let live. People are there for their own improvement. \n\nand that's the last part I'll adress. IF you're willing to sift through the anger and bitterness. There is some genuinely good advice within TRP. But it's not generally in a pleasant \"PC\" format. It's not meant to be. It's supposed to be an abrasive, bitter pill. \n\nI initially tried posting this to menslib. But anything that isn't outright condemnation of the groups in question is not allowed.","title":"Nice guys, incels and TRP. My understanding of the mentalities and how men come to them.

I believe this because I used to be an MRA until I started looking at men's issues from a feminist perspective, which helped me understand and begin to think about women's issues. MRA's have identified feminists as the main cause of their woes, rather than gender roles. More male voices and focus on men's issues in feminist dialogue is something we should all be looking for, and I think that reaching out to MRAs to get them to consider feminism is a way to do that. How do we get MRAs to break the stigma of feminism that is so prevalent in their circles? How do we encourage them to consider male issues by examining gender roles, and from there, begin to understand and discuss women's issues? Or am I wrong?

Though we've had mediums such as games, sports, anime etc to escape ourselves in, it's stiffling feeling like you're undesirable and missing a large portion of your manhood. It's not just purely about the physical nature of sex but rather the notion of validation, acceptance and intimacy that comes with it. \n\nEventually, after reading up on PUA and browsing through the uglier places such as red-pill blogs, I'd lost my V-card at the age of 25 and went on to hook up with other women since. Having previously been the nice, sweet boy who was taught to implement romantic gestures through RomComs and by our own mothers\/sisters, I'd still dealt with nothing but rejection (or even given the cold shoulder or told to \"fuck off\" if I tried to approach politely). I honestly feel like you've got to be a bit douchy or sexist in your own way to pick up women such as objectifying them or calling them out on their shit (in a challenging kind of way). People may berate me for it but it's honestly worked for me much more than I have trying to make polite\/civil conversations or making bad jokes that make them cringe. \n\nIf feminists think that misogyny amongst virgin\/incel men are problematic or that the methods that PUA and red-pillers teach are harmful, why don't they teach them to pick up women (whether it's ONSs, casual sex or relationships) instead of bashing them and telling them sex is not a basic human-need. It's not simply the case of \"be kind, smart, funny, considerate\" and even just hitting the gym isn't sufficient enough without the right attitude (I had a six-pack and still an incel). That way, there wouldn't be any need for controversial spaces such as PUA\/red-pill, there'd be less bitter, angry men with misogynistic views and rape\/sexual assaults would decrease since men would have more access to sex\/intimacy.

I personally see a lot more things that are more socially acceptable for women to feel entitled to than things that are more socially acceptable for men to feel entitled to, but I wanted to get input from others in case I'm missing something.\n\nIt's generally considered more socially acceptable for women to feel entitled to the other person putting in the majority of effort in the early stages of dating, whether it's approaching, planning dates, or initiating conversation between dates. It's generally considered more socially acceptable for women to feel entitled to romantic gestures, material goods (i.e. gifts), and longer-term material support (him making money and using it to support her).\n\nAt first for the other side I thought about the possibility that sex is more socially acceptable for men to feel entitled to, but I don't think that's the case. There's a lot of taboo surrounding pressuring women into sex and I genuinely think that people tend to react react more negatively to a man feeling entitled to sex than a woman feeling entitled to sex.\n\nThe term \"male entitlement\" was used a lot surrounding the Elliot Rodger case and it seemed like the idea was entitlement to relationships and affection, but here too I think it's more socially acceptable for women to feel entitlement. There are numerous \"where have all the good men gone?\" articles lamenting the lack of quality in men or the lack of interest in commitment from men, and they receive relatively little controversy or blow-back except in the Manosphere. The equivalent article from a man would get him cast as a bitter misogynist creep neckbeard. And it seems that when a man is expressing frustration over being friend-zoned the default approach is that he's an asshole, while when a woman is expressing frustration over being sex-zoned the default assumption is that the man's the asshole for not wanting commitment (\"using her\" or \"taking advantage of her\").\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that it's more socially acceptable for men to expect their long-term partner to sacrifice their career for child-care. **Anything else? I'm genuinely interested. There's a good chance I'm missing something.** Perhaps within the area of sex we could say that it's more socially acceptable for a men to feel entitled to an orgasm? But that relies on a difference in ease of orgasm between the genders, and if we look at the issue of time spent focusing on the other person's orgasm then that goes away.\n\n***\n\nI'm particularly interested in entitlement in interactions between men and women for dating, sex, relationships, etc., but if you have thoughts on entitlement in other areas then that could be interesting as well. Also, I'm thinking of this in terms of the social acceptability of each type of entitlement, not how common each time of entitlement is. I think it's easier to be objective when looking at social acceptability, but again if you want to look at it from the angle of general prevalence then that's fine too.","title":"What things are more socially acceptable for men to feel entitled to?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/45x2u6\/what_things_are_more_socially_acceptable_for_men\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

It got me thinking, and I thought it would be illuminating to see what the rest of the sub thought, but by and large, the overwhelming majority of the response to her son's suicide has fallen in the pattern of the \"it's not your fault, don't blame yourself,\" mode of consolation. Now, I'm not suggesting, nor condoning, anyone taking her past comments and shoving them into her face while she's grieving. But I think that we have to take a look at this and give consideration to just how much this might actually be her fault. How much can someone who holds such virulent views segregate her beliefs from her children, and how much does this exposure play into the dysfunction of the child down the road?

The hope was that it would allow the toxic elements of feminism to be weakened.\n\nAssuming that those who express these toxic ideologies are a vocal minority and the quieter majority don't actually agree with them, I would hope that the criticism would lead the quiet majority to either distance themselves from general term \"feminist\" or defend its good name by speaking up against the toxic minority.\n\nThis was not a popular idea so I'm moving on to the idea of criticizing only the toxic feminists. \n\nThe problem is, that these feminists tend not to self-label beyond \"feminist\". Those feminists with much more productive (and more in touch with reality) views tend to be more specific with the labels they wear. Two examples from this sub are \"Individualist Egalitarian Feminist\" and \"Foucauldian Feminist\".\n\nThe feminists I'm talking about tend to be bloggers (or vloggers). The lunatic fringe is active on Tumblr but their ideology looks like simply a more extreme version of that promoted in many popular feminist (or even merely left-leaning) websites. \n\nThey aren't isolated to the internet though. Their influence is most visible on college campuses but it sometimes leaks into the real real world with things like the \"Manspreading\" campaign.\n\nExamples of rhetoric from this type of feminist:\n\n* [\"There\u2019s no such thing as sexism against men.\"](https:\/\/twitter.com\/femfreq\/status\/533445611543363585)\n* [Poison M&M metaphors](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WSIW8Ts.jpg)\n* [Claims that individual lunatics represent average male psychology.](http:\/\/feministcurrent.com\/9033\/male-entitlement-begets-male-entitlement-on-elliot-rodger-misogyny-and-the-sex-industry\/)\n\nThe most prominent feature of these feminists is that their highest priority appears to be building and defending a female victim narrative. Their statements suggest a belief in a patriarchy which is something inflicted by men in general on women in general.\n\nMy question is, is there a name for this style of feminism? If not, can we agree on a label so that it can be held up for criticism without lumping all feminists in with these people?\n\nThe names that come to mind for me are probably too insulting to be useful: Pop feminism or Victimhood feminism.","title":"How can we discuss the problems with certain types of pop-feminism without generalising about all feminists?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2tybqy\/how_can_we_discuss_the_problems_with_certain\/","upvote_ratio":0.78,"over_18":false}

I hope that, independent of affiliation, beliefs, ideology, etc. that folks here can get something from it.\n\nI had a friend that literally saved my life on several occasions.  I knew them intimately, there wasn't a violent bone in their body and they would rather die than see someone hurt.  (I am going to leave details vague because if I'm more specific, it can be used to identify me).  They received, for months, threats from an individual accusing them of being a pedophile and actively molesting children.  This individual reported it to the police numerous times, each time the evidence showing that there was no way that the report was valid.\n\nThis individual walked into where my friend worked and shot them twice in the chest and once in the head.  At trial, the murderers defense centered on self defense on behalf of the children they believed were being molested.  The trial was public enough that news media twisted it into a story about vigilante justice rather than a murder.\n\nWhen sentencing was being handed out (a unanimous guilty was returned from the jury), as part of their statements, the judge asked \"Did you ever stop to think 'what if I'm wrong?'\"\n\nThe murderer genuinely believed they were defending children and preventing harm to other children.  I thought to myself, what if I'm wrong about my friend?  If I was, and they were a pedophile, I saw no evidence of it, they police saw no evidence of it.  If I was wrong, defense of their character and telling the truth when on the stand was not immoral, my actions would be reasonable whether I was right or not.\n\nThis has been the guiding question any time I try to effect a change...If I'm wrong, are the actions still morally defensible, is the state of the world (or a tiny part of it) improved, even if I am wrong?  If my actions and the result are only morally defensible if I'm right, it is the wrong solution.  Morally defensible is important here, as any other distinction can lead to situations where it's impossible to act (say, a stranger is standing in your living room at midnight and you live alone.  They may just be confused and in the wrong home, but it is morally defensible to defend yourself and your property as if they were a burglar).","title":"What if I'm wrong?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2hri1j\/what_if_im_wrong\/","upvote_ratio":0.82,"over_18":false}

No mention of girls equals men. Think about what that means.\n\nWhen women are harmed by violence, it's violence against women; when men are harmed by violence, it's just violence.

Their reaction mirrors the frustration behind the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests: feeling unfairly judged based on an aspect of their identity. While BLM has a legitimate point in exposing systemic racism, it becomes more complicated when people defend statements like #menaretrash, #yesallmen, or the \"man or bear\" meme. Do those who defend these messages understand the harm they\u2019re perpetuating?\n\nSociety generally agrees that it\u2019s acceptable to criticize Nazi sympathizers, alt-right extremists, and militia groups. But lately, it seems men, in general, have been added to that list. But why? Men are present in those problematic groups, yes, but so are women. It\u2019s not as though those groups are exclusively male.\n\nIf the argument is that men as a whole are as evil as Nazis, that\u2019s a pretty extreme\u2014and frankly, unsustainable\u2014position to hold. The best I can tell is this permission comes from a pop-feminist interpretation of patriarchy theory, where men are seen as an oppressor class. But even this falls short. Historically, the vast majority of men lived in the same harsh conditions as women, burdened by rigid gender roles and survival challenges. It\u2019s not accurate\u2014or fair\u2014to paint all men as oppressors, especially not today.\n\nThis pervasive, subtle sexism is not just about hashtags like #menaretrash or #yesallmen; it\u2019s about the everyday ways men are portrayed as inherently dangerous or toxic simply for being men. This has long lasting effects and starts early.\n\nIf hypothetically you were told from a young age that just by existing as a man, you\u2019re potentially harmful, how would that affect your self-worth? How would it shape your interactions with the world? We see the impact of systemic bias on other groups all the time. Take the experiences of Black students in predominantly white schools\u2014they often face challenges that negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being because of the constant pressure of being seen as \"different\" or \"less than.\" Similarly, if men are conditioned to believe they're dangerous just for being male, it\u2019s easy to see how this could damage their self-worth and behavior. It\u2019s no different from the kind of systemic biases that other marginalized groups have fought against for years. And yet, when men point out this bias, they're often dismissed or ridiculed.\n\nI\u2019m not saying men don\u2019t have privilege in many areas\u2014that\u2019s a separate discussion. But privilege in one area doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore issues in another. The fact that some men hold positions of power doesn\u2019t negate that the average guy is still dealing with being stereotyped as a predator or a ticking time bomb. Yet we continue to be surprised that men dont like this.\n\nSo, what are you going to do with this information? Will you keep hiding behind hashtags like #menaretrash and pretend it\u2019s all just a joke? Or will you stop and realize that by defending these ideas, you're participating in the same kind of lazy, damaging generalizations that we've fought against in other contexts?\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable labeling half the population as dangerous or evil based on their gender, then maybe it\u2019s time to admit that your worldview is hypocritical, simplistic, or, frankly, stupid. But if you\u2019re not, and you actually care about improving society, then it\u2019s time to speak up and call this out for what it is: unacceptable. Just as we work to dismantle racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry, we need to start addressing this new form of gender bias before it becomes entrenched.\n\nSo here\u2019s the challenge: if you truly believe men as a group are inherently dangerous, let\u2019s have that debate. But if you recognize this bias for what it is, then stop excusing it. Either confront the idea head-on and justify it, or admit that it\u2019s flawed and work to change the narrative. Because if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re just perpetuating the same kind of discrimination we claim to fight against.\n\n__________________________________\nHere are responses to the possible counterarguments in a question-and-answer format:\n\n1. **Counterargument: Men Hold Institutional Power**\n   - *Response*: Does holding institutional power mean that every man is inherently dangerous or toxic? Can we address issues of power and privilege without resorting to harmful generalizations about all men?\n\n2. **Counterargument: Not All Criticism is Harmful**\n   - *Response*: Even if phrases like #menaretrash are expressions of frustration, does that justify the psychological impact they have on men who are trying to be good allies? Can raising awareness be effective without demonizing an entire gender?\n\n3. **Counterargument: Focus on Intersectionality**\n   - *Response*: How can we have an intersectional conversation if we\u2019re not acknowledging that men also face biases, particularly in ways that impact their mental health and self-worth? Shouldn\u2019t intersectionality include the challenges men face as well?\n\n4. **Counterargument: Privilege and Fragility**\n   - *Response*: Is it fragile to point out that labeling someone as inherently dangerous just because of their gender is harmful? Can we address toxic masculinity without perpetuating a different kind of toxicity against men?\n\n5. **Counterargument: False Equivalence**\n   - *Response*: Is it really a false equivalence, or are we seeing a pattern where systemic bias\u2014whether based on race, gender, or something else\u2014has similar harmful effects on individuals? Shouldn\u2019t we recognize and address bias wherever it exists?\n\n6. **Counterargument: Accountability vs. Bias**\n   - *Response*: How do we balance holding individuals accountable with avoiding harmful stereotypes? Isn\u2019t it possible to hold men accountable for their actions without labeling all men as dangerous or toxic?\n\n7. **Counterargument: Generalizations About Men**\n   - *Response*: Isn\u2019t the point of challenging these generalizations to encourage more nuanced conversations? How can we ensure that our critiques of harmful gender norms don\u2019t themselves fall into the trap of overgeneralization?

[Crying doesn't relieve emotions for a lot of people.](https:\/\/healthland.time.com\/2011\/08\/01\/study-crying-wont-make-you-feel-better\/) \n\nI personally definitely feel this. I always feel worse after crying. It's pretty pointless. Talking about my feelings is stressful, if very possible. I know the names, I know how to draw them out and associated sensations, but it isn't something I would do to relax.\n\nNow you might be thinking, is this not evidence of the patriarchy, of toxic masculinity forcing a gender stereotype on people's minds? No. [It's mostly mothers who have a bias against crying in men](https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/sci-tech\/boys-don-t-cry-study-suggests-mothers-not-fathers-show-gender-bias-towards-sons-1.4693208) and my and friend's girlfriends have commonly reacted badly. Your own girlfriends may be vastly different, but that's my experience. \n\nLoss of sexual attraction, gossiping about secrets, using signs of weakness in arguments, or telling us that we weren't allowed to be weak are common things we've been told or had done to us. Complaints about emotional labour and how we are abusing the women in our lives by making them take on our emotional burdens are common.\n\nBy contrast, I do cry more with male friends. When watching league of legends streams, or intense sports games it's easy to cry when your team wins or loses. When I've had a really bad time I feel perfectly comfortable hugging a guy friend and crying about it, because I know most of them don't have any particular view on crying and are fine with it. \n\nThe real problem for a lot of men is isolation. They don't have good friends they can rely on. They're not rich enough to get a therapist, and finding a good therapist is hard because they tend to have a bias. Those who don't need to cry often need help escaping violent situations where they have no freedom. The law actively seeks to rip away freedom, money, and family from men and worsen their mental health. These aren't things that are fixed by telling men to cry more or talk about their feelings, and it's actively dangerous for a lot of men to talk about their feelings, not because of the patriarchy, but because of unsupportive people in their lives. \n\nReal support comes from asking what you can do for men, not telling men they need to follow the easiest solution for you. Depressed men need better support, therapy, and less government abuse. They can't do it on their own, and pushing crying and talking about feelings is an unhelpful way to help them.","title":"Why male tears pushes are bad","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/11nyxwr\/why_male_tears_pushes_are_bad\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

Well, that intrigued me, so I went searching it and I found [this review](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2021\/aug\/19\/the-right-to-sex-by-amia-srinivasan-review-the-politics-of-sexual-attraction), in which I found this interesting passage:\n\n>Starting in the 1980s, Srinivasan says in her chapter \u201cSex, Carceralism and Capitalism\u201d, \u201cUS feminists successfully campaigned for states to adopt \u2018mandatory arrest\u2019 policies which require the police to make an arrest when they are called to a domestic violence complaint.\u201d As research in Wisconsin has shown, this led to three times as many black men being arrested as white men, a significant contribution to the mass incarceration of black men. \u201cWhen feminists embrace carceral solutions,\u201d Srinivasan concludes, \u201cthey give cover to the governing class in its refusal to tackle the deepest causes of most crime.\u201d\n\nThis reminded me of the MRM's complaint of mandatory arrest policies and their pointing out of how it has led to abused men being arrested even when they are the ones who call the police, due to automatic assumptions about who the abuser is. I found it interesting to see these mandatory arrest policies being brought up in another context for roughly the same reason, that being its disproportionate effects on different groups. The implication is that it reveals a racial bias.\n\nOf course, we know that romantic relationships (and possibly especially where the partners are living together) are almost entirely intersexual (i.e. the partners are different sex), whereas racially, they tend to be intraracial (i.e. the partners are the same race). Given that, it seems to me the increase in black arrest rates reveals that black partners are more often calling the police (or having the police called on them by their likely black neighbours) for domestic violence, and it's hard to implicate the police officers themselves in the biased outcome, whereas the increase in arrest rates being almost entirely male seems more damning, especially when we have plenty of reports of men being arrested for being abused.\n\nIt's possible you have a black man and a white man in a relationship, and the black man calling the police for domestic abuse then being assumed to be the aggressor and arrested, but an interracial intrasexual relationship sounds like a much rarer occurrence than an intraracial intersexual relationship, where it seems the potential for anti-male bias is most frequent. There are also the interracial intersexual relationships, which would be the most obvious candidates for an intersectional analysis, and those would be relationships with a white man and black woman \u2014 where there is anti-male and anti-black biases to consider, and both could play out in the same DV call to the police where there's a sort of tug of war, or just one \u2014 and relationships with a black man and white woman \u2014 where there is anti-male and anti-black biases to consider and both or either could play out on the same person in the same DV call to the police.\n\nNote that the quote points out the disparity in white male vs. black male incarceration, and the maleness of the incarcerateds are taken for granted, yet the far more frequent and easier to prove bias that plays out here, which frequency and relative ease of proving is just due to the sexuality and racuality configurations of most relationships, is completely ignored. In states with the Duluth model, the assumption of male aggressor is top down and systemic and even more blatant.\n\n---\n\nI haven't read the book yet, but this is just a passing set of thoughts I had when I read this passage of it from this review.\n\nHowever, I'm leaving this thread open to any discussion about this book. Has anyone here read it? What were your thoughts?

It's a Marxist analysis of modern sex relations (I use \"modern\" loosely). The basic argument is that in the modern day, it's woman that has economic supremacy over man. I will provide some excerpts below and leave it open for interpretation:\n\n\"We have often heard discussions of the reason we do not find women, as a sex, in the vanguard of world affairs; why the great educators, strong figures in progressive or revolutionary movements, are men rather than women; why these movements, themselves, are made up almost entirely of men rather than women...  We believe the answer lies in the fact that women, as a sex, are the owners of a commodity vitally necessary to the health and well-being of man. Women occupy a more fortunate biologic, and in many countries, a more fortunate economic position, in the increasingly intensified struggle for existence. And the preferred class, the biologically and economically favored class, or sex, has rarely been efficient-to-do, has never been revolutionary to attack a social system that accords advantage to it.\"\n\n\"As a sex, women occupy a position similar to the petty shop-keeper, because they possess a commodity to sell or to barter. Men, as a sex, are buyers of, or barterers for, this commodity. The general attitude on this question of sex may be, and in fact usually is, wholly unconscious; but the fact remains that men and women meet each other, in the capitalist system, as buyers and sellers of, or barterers for, a commodity.\"\n\n\"Few people speak frankly about sex matters today. And still fewer understand them and their economic basis. The subject of sex is clothed in pretense. We discuss women philosophically, idealistically, sometimes from the viewpoint of biology, but never from an economic **and** a biological standpoint, which is the only scientific basis from which to regard them.\"\n\n\"And so women, not every individual, but as a **sex**, are ever individualistic, ever competing among themselves, ever displaying their wares, ever looking for a possible purchaser of the commodity they have to sell, ever endeavoring to keep the purchaser satisfied and willing to pay more.\"\n\n\"The psychology of the sexes in youth is totally different. The ideas of the average young man are those of one who expects to become some day a **producer** or at least a **worker**; the ideas of the average young woman are those of one who **expects** and **intends** (for here, too, Youth sees only personal victory) to rise into the leisure, non-producing or **supported** class.\"\n\n\"We are making no claim that the lot of millions of housekeeping mothers, married to working men, is more enviable than is the condition of their husbands. We merely wish to point out that millions of women, potentially, actually, or psychologically, **are** \"of the leisure class,\" and that **fact** and **expectation** keep women, as a sex, allied to the forces of reaction. When a woman is competing in a life and death struggle among a score of other young women, to make a permanent legal bargain which entails the promise of an income or support for life, she has little leisure or energy to spare in making over, or revolutionizing the present social system.\"\n\n\"It is evident, whether due to one cause or to many, that the law, which usually protects those who possess bestowable favors, has gradually built up strong protective measures for women. Among the rich, men and women find protection for their property in the laws, according to the measure of their economic power, but among the wage working and middle classes, woman occupies a privileged legal position.\"\n\n\"No matter what the offense of the woman, custom and public opinion demand that every 'decent' man permit his wife to accuse him on 'just grounds' and to secure the divorce and call on the law to force him to pay her alimony for the rest of their natural lives.\"\n\n\"The laws today protect the owners of property and the economically powerful. The more economic power a group, or a class, or a sex possesses, the more the state throws the mantle of its protective laws about it. Women are owners of a commodity for which men are buyers or barterers, and our modern laws protect woman at the expense of man.\"\n\n\"In his 'Origin of the Family,' Engels says:\n\n'The supremacy of man in marriage is simply the consequence of his economic superiority and will fall with the abolition of the latter.'\n\nIn a large per cent of the American homes, man no longer possesses any economic superiority. He has four vital needs to satisfy while woman has only three, and woman possesses, for barter, for sale, or for gift, the wherewithall to satisfy one of these.\"\n\n\"Few men any longer possess any property worthy of the name; hence, they are forced to sell their labor power for wages to keep from starving. And men are not always able to secure jobs.\"\n\n\"The propertyless woman today is rarely reduced to starvation. If the price (or wages) offered for the sale of her laboring power are unsatisfactory, she may always supplement them through the barter or sale of her sex. That there are no women hoboes in the civilized world today is incontestable proof of the superiority of the economic status of woman over man.\"\n\n\"Women compete for jobs with men today, force down wages to a lower level and demand more from men before they will marry. And yet we see $25.00 a week stenographers giving up their positions to barter themselves, presumably for life, to $35.00 a week clerks or salesmen, rarely because of the mating instinct, but usually because of the personal triumph this means in the competition between members of the sex, and the social approbation which marriage brings.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, in the New Society, conditions will be very much changed for women. But they will also be greatly changed for men. What the future sex relations will be, we do not pretend to know. Perhaps the statement by Frederick Engels in his 'Origin of the Family,' is as good a forecast as any. He says:\n\n'What we may anticipate about the adjustment of sexual relations after the impending downfall of capitalist production is mainly of a negative nature and mostly confined to elements that will disappear. But what will be added? That will be decided after a new generation has come to maturity: a race of men who never in their lives have had any occasion for buying with money or other economic means of power the surrender of a woman; a race of women who have never had any occasion for surrendering to any man for any other reason but love, or for refusing to surrender to their lover from fear of economic consequences. Once such people are in the world, they will not give a moment's thought to what we today believe should be their course. They will follow their own practice and fashion their own public opinion about the individual practice of every person\u2014only this and nothing more.'\"","title":"Women As Sex Vendors Or Why Women Are Conservative (Being a View of the Economic Status of Woman) By R.

But please hear me out.\n\nFeminists often reassure anti-feminists that \"patriarchy\" doesn't mean \"men\" collectively, and that \"patriarchy\" hurts men.\n\nMen's Rights Activists often talk about the Apex Fallacy and how there is a preponderance of men not just at the very top but also at the very bottom.\n\nIn other parts of the manosphere (specifically the Red Pill and Black Pill areas), we see absolute rage and resentment directed towards the \"Chads.\" Or the \"(natural) Alphas.\" Take one read of Elliot Rodger's manifesto if you want to see just how much he hated and envied the Chads.\n\nLet us synthesize these three strands of thought. We no longer think in terms of \"men\" as an homogeneous bloc, because \"men\" are NOT an homogeneous bloc. The \"patriarchs\/chads\/alphas\" disown and distance themselves from the \"lesser\" men and don't want to help them. They act not in terms of \"men as a class\" but to support an hierarchy they benefit from.\n\nMeanwhile, the bottom tier of men are socially emasculated. Because lots of so-called \"male\" privilege is really \"patriarch privilege\/alpha privilege\/Real Manhood privilege\" these men are not the privileged oppressors. \n\nLet us remember George Orwell's *1984*, where Orwell rejected binary oppressor-oppressed class analysis in favor of a trinary class analysis where the high want to maintain their place, the middle want to overthrow and replace the high, and the low want to abolish the hierarchy in its entirety. \n\nCould a version of this model be applied to gender relations, where the Patriarchs\/Alphas are the \"high,\" women in general are placed in the \"middle\" and the non-Patriarch males are placed in the \"low,\" be both feasible and something which both Feminists and MHRAs agree upon?\n\nAfter all, as even many feminists have argued, a non-trivial amount of feminist activism has worked primarily to advance the interests of middle-to-upper-class educated career women.. or to help members of the middle become \"part of\" the high, at least to some extent (access to similar privileges\/treatment\/roles). MHRAs note this in discussions of the Glass Ceiling vs. the Glass Cellar, and Pill-o-sphere types allude to this through the concept of Hypergamy.\n\nThe only real difference I see in Orwell's model vs. a trinary understanding of \"patriarchy\" is that in Orwell's model, the middle enlist the low to overthrow the high. But in gender relations, we see the middle appealling to the high, and the high making concessions to the middle as a kind of costly signalling\/countersignalling\/pulling up the ladder behavior.\n\nOr, alternatively, it could be argued that social justice \"entryism\" into nerd culture is an *attempt* by the middle to enlist the low... albeit one which has backfired spectacularly. \n\nCould this model work as a common ground for both feminists and MHRAs and pill-o-sphere types? It would require some concessions from all sides (i.e. it would be a kind of \"patriarchy\" that MHRAs would have to acknowledge, it would preserve the idea of \"patriarchy\" but require the acceptance of some degree of female privilege). \n\nNOTE: I'm not saying that we stick with three classes. We could go to four. I'm just proposing the three-class model as a starting point.","title":"Could We Agree On A \"Trinary\" Patriarchy?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/k2gqeh\/could_we_agree_on_a_trinary_patriarchy\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

I found no examples where a man was 'hit' by a woman.\n\nAn example of the the sexist attitudes in this document are found on page 194. Some examples of questions to be asked of students:\n\n* The main cause of violence against women is\nthat men are unable to manage their anger. \n\n* Rape results from men not being able to control\ntheir sexual urges\n\n* A woman could leave a violent relationship if she\nreally wanted to.\n\n* Women make up or exaggerate claims of\npartner violence in family law cases.\n\n* If a woman is drunk or high on drugs she is\npartly to blame if she is sexually assaulted.\n\n* Women often say no when they mean yes.\n\n* Women who say they were raped led the man\non and later had regrets.\n\nThese are all the non-gender neutral questions. As you can see women are always presented as the victim and men always as the perpetrator.\n\nI find this extremely problematic for a number of reasons;\n\n1. Girls are getting the message that they can't abuse boys. This will result in some\/many not realising that they are engaging in violent\/abuse behaviours against the men in their lives.\n\n2. Boys are getting the message that they can't be abused by girls. This results in them believing that violent\/abusive behaviours they are experiencing are 'normal'.\n\n3. Girls may be blinded to violence they experience from other girls.\n\n4. Boys and girls will see boys as being dangerous, as potential perpetrators. This encourages traditional gender norms, and perpetrates the myth that men are violent and women are victims.\n\n5. Boys will be blinded to violence they experience from other boys.\n\n6. Both boys and girls will believe only men engage in sexual abuse and rape. \n\nI am sure there are many others, but this is already long enough. Frankly I am incredibly disheartened this is being used in schools to teach students about violence in relationships.","title":"Australian 'Respectful Relationships: Teaching and Learning Package' teaches that abusers can only be men.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/dz09ye\/australian_respectful_relationships_teaching_and\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

There are a lot of films where they've done the latter, e.g. (some possible spoilers)\n\n - \"The Glass Castle\", where they mention a man trying to coax a woman into sex, but say *absolutely nothing* about the scene of the grandmother molesting her grandson, or the implication that she molested her own son in that same movie\n - \"The Witch\", where they mention a young boy leering at his sister, but nothing about the witch in the form of a nude woman kissing the same pre-teen boy for several seconds later on (they only say \"nothing sensitive is shown\", so I guess they don't consider a nude woman kissing a child in an attempt to seduce him anything \"sensitive\")\n - \"It Follows\", where they neglect to mention the entity raping a man to death (while it's in the form of his mother)\n - \"Knock Knock\", where they also neglect to mention that the **two women rape the main character,** instead *saying that he \"cheats\"* on his wife with them\n - \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", where they don't mention the scene of the aunt molesting her nephew\n - \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", where naturally they mention all the bondage with Anastasia, but nothing about the 15-year-old boy being groomed by his mother's friend into being her sexual submissive in a BDSM relationship \n\nWhenever I looked at *any film* with the same sexual abuse against women or girls, it will always be mentioned.

Grrl Pwr pop feminism is part of our zeitgeist, and the latter sculptor should be commended for her capture of it.\n\nOn the other hand, I think the prior artist has a valid point.  His work has been coopted, and it's meaning changed.  I'm old enough to remember the shitty, shitty recession of the late 80s when the bull statue first went in.  It was (and to me still is) a statement about defiance against adversity.  It's meaning has now been coopted to stand in as a subject of opression.\n\nMaybe Fearless Girl has captured another part of the zeitgeist.  In order to present the appearance of victimhood, we are willing to reinvent the past.","title":"\u2018Charging Bull\u2019 Sculptor Says \u2018Fearless Girl\u2019 Violates His Rights","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/65dxvc\/charging_bull_sculptor_says_fearless_girl\/","upvote_ratio":0.95,"over_18":false}

I'll do a bit of a transcript here:\n\n> What is it with you guys?\n\n>> What do you mean?\n\n> Every man I've known is always trying to let each other know how tough they are. Put 'em in their place.\n\n> Buncha dominant, alpha male horse shit. And it all ends the same way.\n\nFor context. The world saw a zombie apocalypse two years ago, all structured society has fallen apart. At this point, stray groups of survivors, and some impromptu fortresses is all that humanity really has to offer.\n\nTo which my flatmate says something along the lines of: \"It's because the patriarchy makes them act out toxic masculinity, which makes them strive for social dominance.\"\n\nAt which point I realize, that in her mind, society can literally be dismantled completely, without that being the end of patriarchy. Even in a society where political and economical power is completely down to individual, where the rule is survival of the fittest, patriarchy persists. This touches upon the idea that the patriarchy is a kind of abstract \"evil\" that can be blamed for anything that goes wrong.\n\nSo, this raises some questions in my mind: \n\n- What does the patriarchy do, specifically? \n\n- How does it die? \n\n- Is there a causal relationship between patriarchy and gender roles? \n\n    -  In that case, which one influences the other, and how? \n\n- Is patriarchy a useful term in any real respect?\n\n- How frequently is the term misused, and how much of an effect does that have on discourse?\n\nI'll admit to not having discussed this with my flatmate to explore the ideas further, the last time we discussed gender issues (wage gap), she ate all the chocolate, and dinner was two hours late.","title":"Zombie patriarchy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/636njx\/zombie_patriarchy\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

However, this topic is important to me and I'm not sure where else to go with it.\n\nNot long ago I became aware of Scott Aaronson's [Comment 171](http:\/\/www.scottaaronson.com\/blog\/?p=2091#comment-326664). Until I read this comment - and its fallout - I thought my personal experience with sexuality and feminism was entirely unique. The details don't match up exactly, but it was uncannily close. I was raised and educated as a conservative Catholic, with all the bodily shame that entails. As we were all made aware, boys and men are only after one thing. My post-puberty education contained extended doses of teachers and clergy trying to convince my peers and me not to have sex with each other, or else. When I went to college, I was taken aback by the anger of campus feminists towards men, and was informed straight-up by a feminist gender studies professor that I, along with all other men, were rapists in fact even if not in deed - not potential rapists, but actual rapists. (Most people I have told this story haven't believed me, to which I have to throw up my hands.)\n\nAll of this made me aware that, sexually, I was a monster and a predator, and would remain so even though I didn't want to rape or abuse anyone. So naturally I paired off with a woman who herself had been sexually abused and treated me like a monster and a predator. Fast forward 20+ years and even though my life has changed completely and I've had years of therapy, I am still unable to enjoy sex and have come to understand that I will always feel like a monster and predator, no matter what.\n\nI understand I'm in the clear minority, which is good. For most people, sex still feels good no matter what they've been told. In turn, I blamed myself for being this way, then I blamed Catholicism, then feminism. In the end it's probably a combination of everything - my naive personality and lack of skepticism; regressive religious attitudes; angry and sex-negative feminists. Without any one of these things, I might have a happy, active sex life. But I got what I got.\n\nI guess my question is, how do we help the too-sensitive souls like me who take messages to heart that aren't really meant for them? This is the main objection I have to attitudes like \"Teach men not to rape\" - the boys and men who actually need to be taught not to rape won't listen, and the ones who don't and are overly impressionable might have their lives warped unnecessarily. I wonder, if a person I trusted had told me \"I don't think you're a monster or a predator\" during my formative years, would that have helped?","title":"Unintended consequences of gender-related messages","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4ybvlq\/unintended_consequences_of_genderrelated_messages\/","upvote_ratio":0.97,"over_18":false}

The people who take part in this female-focused activism (those with priorities like Justin Trudeau), what is the type of society they're trying to achieve? Is their goal similar to what will actually come out of their activism?\n\nMy point here is that it seems like the current activism trend will result in a society where inequalities that harm women have been erased while inequalities that harm men have been left, or in some cases maybe even worsened. Gender ratios are equal in politics, business, technology, etc., with disparities remaining in homelessness, prison population, drug addiction, and murder victims.\n\nIs this the goal of the people engaged in the current activism patterns? Is this what they consider an equal society? Or do they advocate that, after this society has been achieved, they can then change priorities to address the disparities that harm men?

I honestly gave it serious thought, and while I didn't choose ones on the list it certainly was influential.  But, when I look back at this, I find it rather silly and honestly see the idea behind it very out of date.  It would be one thing if the vast majority of articles I saw were looking at things women often face, like needing flexible hours as many often are also the main caregivers, or jobs that are easy to get back into after maternity leave.  But they were not, they were usually what jobs are people looking for and how many women are in it.  \n\nI ask you to look at the idea behind this and imagine if this was applied to other things.

How much of an effect it has, I can't say, but I can't think of a good reason to have such articles.  Perhaps if these articles were phrased in a way that would make it appear to be for women who want to be surrounded by mostly women, but as it stands they often portrayed it as along the lines of \"As a woman you should consider this.\"  And I don't think for purely being a woman, I should have considered it.  \n\n","title":"Why I am against \"Jobs for women\" articles.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2yom2d\/why_i_am_against_jobs_for_women_articles\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false}

I do not mean that sexual biology has no influence on behavior. I do not mean that the sex of individuals are arbitrary or random choices, that any man could just as easily be a woman or vice-versa.\n\nSex is based on objective, biological facts:\n\n* whether one has XX or XY chromosomes is not a social construct\n\n* whether one has a penis or a vagina is not a social construct\n\n* what levels of hormones one has, and the impact that these hormones can have on behavior and biology, is not a social construct\n\nSo in what sense *is* sex a social construct?\n\n1. What biological traits we choose as the basis for sex is a product of social work. Sex is sometimes based on chromosomes, and sometimes on genitals, for example. This choice has consequences. A person with [CAIS](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Complete_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome) could have XY chromosomes and the genitals\/body that we associate with females. In a chromosome-based model of sex, that person is a man, and in a genital-based model, they are a woman. For models that consider multiple traits, the issue becomes more ambiguous.\n\n2. How we schematize the biological traits that we single out as the basis of sex is a social act that can be done differently. Whether we base sex on genitals, hormones, chromosomes, or some combination of all of them, we see more than two types of people. Some social constructions of sex recognize more than two sexes because of this, while others only acknowledge the most statistically common combinations (male and female), while classifying everything else as a sort of deformity or disorder. What schema of sex we choose has serious social consequences: consider the practice of surgically altering intersex infants so that they \"unambiguously\" fall into the accepted categories of male or female. \n\nBiology is absolutely a factor. Objective reality is still the basis for these categories. The social choices we make are often motivated by objective, biological facts (for example, human reproductive biology and demographics give us strong reasons to use a biological model of just two sexes). \n\nHowever, the inescapable truth remains that there is social work involved in how we conceptualize objective facts, that these conceptualizations can be socially constructed in different (but equally accurate) ways, and that which (accurate) way we choose of socially constructing the facts of reality has meaningful consequences for individuals and society. \n\nEdit 1\n---\n\nTo be clear, sex is my example here (because I find it to be especially helpful for demonstrating this point), but my ultimate goal is to demonstrate a better sense of social construction than what the phrase is sometimes taken to mean. \"Socially constructed\" doesn't have to mean purely arbitrary or independent of objective reality, but can instead refer to the meaningfully different ways that we can accurately represent objective reality (as well as the meaningful consequences of choosing one conceptualization over another).\n\nEdit 2\n---\n\nAs stoked as I am by the number of replies this is generating, it's also a tad overwhelming. I eventually do want to respond to everything, but it might take me awhile to do so. For now I'm chipping away at posts in more or less random order based on how much time I have at a given moment to devote to replies.

While some people appear to believe that this is an important topic, we^1 are going to argue that these discussions are largely, though not necessarily always, more harmful than they are beneficial. Additionally, we are likely all aware of the \u201coppression olympics\u201d that gender-based discussions are imbued with, and as such, we hope to highlight why these arguments usually impede those who wish to effect meaningful change. \n\nTo begin with, the question of which gender has it worse is exceedingly difficult to resolve, probably so much so as to become a practical impossibility, at least with any foreseeable technology.  While in principle it would be possible to tally up the ways gender benefits and harms *every* human being on the planet, the task rapidly accumulates too many variables to be reasonable to answer, especially when there are reasonable arguments for either conclusion.  Worse, even if it were feasible to definitively answer the question \u201cIs the average man more or less hurt by gender issues than the average woman?\u201d, it would be of little practical importance.  It would not, for example, provide an answer to the question \u201cIs it better to be a man or a woman?\u201d  To do that, you would first need an answer to the question \u201cWho are you, and which man and which woman?\u201d.  For example, \/u\/antimatter_beam_core likes to cook, which would tend to make them more happy in and suited for a traditionally female role.  On the other hand, both of us like STEM^2 and in many ways it is easier to be a man in these fields, despite the progress that has been made over the past century. This means that even if we were able to conclude that one gender is hurt more, on average, by gender issues than another, this resolution does not take into account individual circumstances and preferences, and thus could not tell you what gender an individual would benefit from being. \n\nCentral to our beliefs on this board and in real life is the principal that *human* suffering is important to address. This means that regardless of the gender of the person suffering, there needs to be aid available to them. While we recognize that the manifestations of suffering may, but not always, be divided amongst gender lines and these symptoms are extremely important to discuss, this does not in any way imply the conclusion that one individual\u2019s suffering is more deserving of aid, sympathy, etc. as a result of their gender. Again, it\u2019s the affliction that we believe should be the focus of gender advocacy. This belief is fundamental to some of our respective positions. For example, if we assume that we can conclusively prove that one gender has it worse than the other *as a collective* when it comes to a certain issue (that is, ignoring our earlier point and assuming it is possible to conclude such a thing), this means next to absolutely nothing (if nothing at all) to an individual of the \u201cbetter-off\u201d gender who may be suffering more than the average person of the \u201cworse-off\u201d gender. We believe that this person would still be deserving of help and sympathy because of their individual situation, and should not be denied access to said help and sympathy because of a presumed collective status. \n\nIn keeping with the previous point, there seems to be little to no advantage to determining which gender - as a collective - has it worse.  Regardless of the answer, there will still be people suffering who need help, and we should still help them.  The specifics of exactly who they are, and exactly how they suffer may vary, but not the basic position just stated.  Who has it worse makes no difference as to how we should endeavor to treat a woman returning home with PTSD after serving her country abroad, or a man trying to deal with the trauma of a date rape.  And that *is* what we\u2019re trying to fix, isn\u2019t it?  That this stuff hurts people?\n\nIt is for this reason that we\u2019ve become increasingly convinced that the motivation for the interest in this question lies at least partially elsewhere.  Specifically, we believe that people are being distracted by the search for the pleasure of proving yourself right, and proving one\u2019s ideological opponents wrong.  Seductive as this prospect may be, it is important to realize that the important thing is not to beat anyone else, but to fix the problems that are present.  In a phrase (and with apologies to [XKCD](http:\/\/xkcd.com\/701\/)): you don\u2019t use gender justice to show that you\u2019re right, you use gender justice to make the world right.\n\nWe believe that a common result of thinking that it is practically important to determine who has it worse is to divide people along lines of ideology. To illustrate this point, the user \/u\/carmyk recently made a [comment](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2p7mjv\/repost_2005_harvard_debate_between_dr_stephen\/cmujarx) which stated:\n\n>The real question isn't \"Why are there so few women in engineering?\" The real question is \"What else are boys going to do?\" \n\nwhereas we believe that *both* are \u201creal\u201d question**s** that deserve answers. When people become so entrenched (which, of course, is not to say that this applies to this user) in the discussion over who has it worse, we lose sight of the ways in which an issue hurts *everyone*, and thus become prone to one-sided analysis. A simple tweak to the highlighted statement above to make it more in line with our views would be:\n\n>The ~~real~~ question isn't only \"Why are there so few women in engineering?\" ~~The real~~ Another question is \"What else are boys going to do?\" \n\nSuddenly we have a far more comprehensive, thought-provoking statement that encourages people to consider both sides of the proverbial equation. By removing the inclination to focus on which is worse, we start to focus on the ways in which *people* (not only men or only women) are suffering.\n\nOne of the common rebuttals to our position is the idea that *if* we can prove (or at least reasonably estimate) which gender has it worse and to what degree, we can proportionately divide any resources that those issues receive (i.e. grants from the government, donated time from volunteers, etc.). The implication of this line of thinking from those who espouse it means that issues that can be quantified in such a way are naturally constant-sum to the point that it matters. However, we have yet to see someone conclusively prove (or even come close to it) that this is the logical resolution. In other words, proponents of this position tend to believe that a) there is a limited number of resources available to address certain issues (we believe this to be trivially true) b) the number of resources available *are insufficient* to address certain issues (this is the point of contention) and therefore, c) resources are zero-sum (and because we disagree with b), we don\u2019t believe that c) matters to a significant degree). To illustrate our position less abstractly, we look to the example of the [donation Toyota gave to the Food Bank for New York City](http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/07\/27\/nyregion\/in-lieu-of-money-toyota-donates-efficiency-to-new-york-charity.html?pagewanted=all). Toyota donated the time of an unknown number of engineers to apply *kaizen* (a Japanese concept known in English as continuous improvement) to the Food Bank\u2019s production and delivery services. The results of the donation can be watched [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EedMmMedj3M). A brief summary is Toyota cut the wait time for dinner from 90 minutes to 18 minutes by implementing a different seating algorithm, reduced the packing time of the boxes from 3 minutes to 11 seconds (!!!), and changed the dimensions of the box so that each delivery person could pack boxes more tightly, thereby allowing for more boxes to be delivered by one individual. A seemingly minor one-time donation of efficiency had a dramatic increase in the number of people served, without costing any money. We believe that this concept can be applied to most, if not all, resources donated to people, charities, etc. that are working towards addressing gender-related issues. In summary, there is no reason to believe that just because the resources available for undertaking an issue are limited, they cannot be appropriately used so as to address the needs of everyone affected by an issue (at least, not without further evidence, which thus far we have not seen anyone produce). \n\nA tangential point related to the paragraph above is the apparent behaviour most of us exhibit in response to issues that affect those we choose to help. On the one hand, we are sure many of the users here agree in a loose ranking of importance of issues, with items such as rape, murder, assault, homelessness, etc. near the top, and many other issues (we won\u2019t name some lest that spark the wrong argument) ranking near the bottom. However, while there is some occasional mud-slinging by some users who believe that others are focusing on the wrong issues, it is rarely suggested that *everyone* begin to focus on *only* the worst issues. People seem to realize that there are enough human resources to go around to focus on many issues at one time, and yet many people also seem to think that this somehow does not apply to addressing the issues of both genders. The apparent hypocrisy in these beliefs is something we believe people need to evaluate. \n\nAnother counterargument that we anticipate is that the individualism inherent in much of our argument is a crippling flaw, and that instead gender issues should be viewed through a more \u201cstructural\u201d lense.  We strongly reject this on the following ground: individuals exist, this much is obvious.  What is slightly less obvious, but still clear, is that individuals can be considered when considering ethical questions.  If this was not the case, it would not be possible to answer any ethical question involving potential conflict between three or fewer people, since doing so would require considering at least one of them as an individual.  On the other hand, groups of people (including groups defined on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, class, etc.) do exist.  Crucially, however, their existence is wholly dependent on the existence, properties, and interaction of the individuals that comprise them.  In short, groups are an emergent phenomenon of individuals, and the behavior of the former can be wholly understood in terms of the behavior of the latter, although perhaps not easily.  Approximations and simplifications can be made by considering groups, but they can never exceed the accuracy of individualist analysis, just as a linear fit can never be better than a quadratic, cubic or power fit^3 . \n\nOne of the foremost contentions we have with the idea that it is a valid exercise to determine which gender has it worse is the belief that it is exceedingly difficult, if not outright impossible to quantify suffering on a workable scale. We maintain that the important argument is not \u201cWho has it worse?\u201d, but rather, \u201cWho is suffering and what can be done to help them?\u201d. This belief does not preclude us from wanting to understand manifestations of suffering and how they may be different based on the gender of the person affected. Additionally, we believe that the practical applications of any quantified suffering are almost non-existent, and prevail mostly in our minds as a sometimes interesting theoretical exercise (which is not to say that this is not useful, but rather, not useful for our intended purpose of promoting meaningful change). Furthermore, discussions on such topics tend to divide people along ideological lines, leading to tribalistic bickering instead of focusing on the issues on hand. We anticipate that some users will tell us that some issues are reliant on constant-sum resources, but we maintain that there is insufficient evidence to accept the conclusion that resources cannot be used in a efficient and productive manner to address the issues of more than one gender. Lastly, while some may take issue with our focus on the individual, we show that addressing the needs of the group can never be more accurate and therefore, beneficial, than addressing the needs of the individual. \n\n---\n\n^1 \u2018we\u2019 referring to \/u\/antimatter_beam_core and \/u\/femmecheng, who collaborated in writing this post, though the user should be able to determine when it refers to the authors vs. a collective group\n\n^2 \/u\/femmecheng is studying mechanical engineering, and \/u\/antimatter_beam_core is studying physics\n\n^3 Any linear equation can be written as a power, a quadratic, or cubic equation thus, even if all the points in a data set being analyzed lie *exactly* on a line, cubic, quadratic, and power fits still work just as well.\n","title":"CMV: Arguing Over Who Has It Worse is Mostly a Futile Exercise That Distracts From Bringing About Meaningful Change","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/2s4p9u\/cmv_arguing_over_who_has_it_worse_is_mostly_a\/","upvote_ratio":0.78,"over_18":false}

The article that is the subject of this post is why I could no longer remain silent on the issue of men's rights.\n\nI have always identified as either an egalitarian or humanist and recognised that everyone, regardless of gender, have issues that affect them. For a long time I believed that everyone talking about and advocating for gender equality were honest and sincere in their beliefs. That was until I found this article by Will Storr in the Observer, [The rape of men: the darkest secret of war](http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2011\/jul\/17\/the-rape-of-men).\n\nI cried reading it, and then I became quite angry. A word of warning, the following is quite graphic.\n\n> Of all the secrets of war, there is one that is so well kept that it exists mostly as a rumour. It is usually denied by the perpetrator and his victim. Governments, aid agencies and human rights defenders at the UN barely acknowledge its possibility.\n\nThe fact that this is seldom discussed is concerning in and of itself, but unfortunately it gets worse.\n\n> For four years Eunice Owiny had been employed by Makerere University's Refugee Law Project (RLP) to help displaced people from all over Africa work through their traumas. This particular case, though, was a puzzle. A female client was having marital difficulties. \"My husband can't have sex,\" she complained. \"He feels very bad about this. I'm sure there's something he's keeping from me.\"\n>\n> Owiny invited the husband in. For a while they got nowhere. Then Owiny asked the wife to leave. The man then murmured cryptically: \"It happened to me.\" Owiny frowned. He reached into his pocket and pulled out an old sanitary pad. \"Mama Eunice,\" he said. \"I am in pain. I have to use this.\"\n>\n> Laying the pus-covered pad on the desk in front of him, he gave up his secret. During his escape from the civil war in neighbouring Congo, he had been separated from his wife and taken by rebels. His captors raped him, three times a day, every day for three years. And he wasn't the only one. He watched as man after man was taken and raped. The wounds of one were so grievous that he died in the cell in front of him.\n\nThese men suffer both physically and emotionally for months and even years after their attacks. And people don't seem to want to help them simply because they are men.\n\n> In Uganda, survivors are at risk of arrest by police, as they are likely to assume that they're gay \u2013 a crime in this country and in 38 of the 53 African nations. They will probably be ostracised by friends, rejected by family and turned away by the UN and the myriad international NGOs that are equipped, trained and ready to help women. They are wounded, isolated and in danger. In the words of Owiny: \"They are despised.\"\n\nAnd they can't afford to meet the dietary requirements brought about by their assaults.\n\n> Today, despite his hospital treatment, Jean Paul still bleeds when he walks. Like many victims, the wounds are such that he's supposed to restrict his diet to soft foods such as bananas, which are expensive, and Jean Paul can only afford maize and millet.\n\nThere is no compassion and understanding from their wives and families. It is not uncommon for them to leave their husbands.\n\n> Often, she says, wives who discover their husbands have been raped decide to leave them. \"They ask me: 'So now how am I going to live with him? As what? Is this still a husband? Is it a wife?' They ask, 'If he can be raped, who is protecting me?' There's one family I have been working closely with in which the husband has been raped twice. When his wife discovered this, she went home, packed her belongings, picked up their child and left. Of course that brought down this man's heart.\"\n\nThe excerpts above were the source of my tears, what follows is the source of my anger. Threats and intimidation from aid agencies just for raising the issue as well as threats to stop funding the RLP because of the focus on male victims. The perception that helping male victims redirects funding and resources away from women seems to be the motivation behind this. \n\n> Stemple's findings on the failure of aid agencies is no surprise to Dolan. \"The organisations working on sexual and gender-based violence don't talk about it,\" he says. \"It's systematically silenced. If you're very, very lucky they'll give it a tangential mention at the end of a report. You might get five seconds of: 'Oh and men can also be the victims of sexual violence.' But there's no data, no discussion.\"\n> \n> As part of an attempt to correct this, the RLP produced a documentary in 2010 called Gender Against Men. When it was screened, Dolan says that attempts were made to stop him. \"Were these attempts by people in well-known, international aid agencies?\" I ask.\n> \n> \"Yes,\" he replies. \"There's a fear among them that this is a zero-sum game; that there's a pre-defined cake and if you start talking about men, you're going to somehow eat a chunk of this cake that's taken them a long time to bake.\" Dolan points to a November 2006 UN report that followed an international conference on sexual violence in this area of East Africa.\n> \n> \"I know for a fact that the people behind the report insisted the definition of rape be restricted to women,\" he says, adding that one of the RLP's donors, Dutch Oxfam, refused to provide any more funding unless he'd promise that 70% of his client base was female. He also recalls a man whose case was \"particularly bad\" and was referred to the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR. \"They told him: 'We have a programme for vulnerable women, but not men.'\"\n\nThe fact that these men were raped by men is immaterial, they also need help and support. It isn't about who is suffering more, it is about who is suffering. Everyone regardless of gender needs compassion, understanding, and support. Actively refusing to help victims of rape just because of their gender is both morally and ethically wrong.\n\nThis is why I identify as an MRA.\n","title":"The Rape of Men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/1so05q\/the_rape_of_men\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

In mental feats, we know men have different brains from women. In physical feats, when men generally outperform women, we suggest it's due to male anatomy.

The comments are presented here for context.)\n\nThe post cited [the work of Tim Goldich](https:\/\/ncfm.org\/2021\/01\/news\/uncategorized\/ncfm-chicago-chapter-president-tim-goldich-femalepower\/), president of the Chicago Chapter of the national coalition for men, as an authoritative assessment of the modes of female power and why they aren't often discussed. In this post, I am going to discuss Goldich's assessment of female power utilizing two frameworks of social-political power. \n\nThe first framework is French and Raven's [Six Bases Model](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/French_and_Raven%27s_bases_of_power#Bases_of_power), which models power as an inherently relative phenomenon and categorizes them into 6 modes. The second is the [Rational Choice Framework](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rational_choice_theory), which is a product of game theory and concieves of power as either Outcome Power, the ability to bring about a certain outcome, and Social Power, the ability to change incentive structures of other actors in order to bring about outcomes. \n\nWith that, here are the 14 powers that Goldich ascribes as \"FemalePower\", power that tends to fall into the hands of women and which he purports balances a power share between women and men throughout history and to today. \n\n**Sexual Leverage Power**\n\nGoldich claims that women generally posess the power of sexual leverage, and that this is related to Emotional Intimacy Power. This power is derived from women holding access to Sexual and Emotional intimacy that men need and can't get from anywhere else. \n\nThis would fall under the Reward model of the Six Bases, which is the type of power derived from being able to provide a suitable reward. In terms of the rational choice framework, this is social power. In both cases, the inherent flaw in this power is that it relies on being able to provide a valuable reward. If your desired outcome is to access a resource (let's say food), then the relational dynamic of this power relies on the value of the reward to the person actually able to attain the outcome, it's not the ability to get the outcome directly. If the reward isn't valuable, then the effectiveness is lesser.\n\nIf this is power, it's necessarily subservient to direct forms of power. It's also conditional on heterosexuality. This power only works, apparently, on heterosexual men who find the reward valuable. Also, this so-called power is indistinguishable from a woman having the free choice to having sex with whom she consents to have sex with. It's hard to see how women's power to such could be challenged with out getting in the way of women's right to withhold consent.\n\n**Beauty Power**\n\nGoldich describes this power as the ability to profit, beguile, open doors, and dazzle through appearance alone. \n\nThis seems just a rehash of the power of sexual leverage. Beguiling who? Who was guarding the closed doors? How do they profit? The answer to all of these is heterosexual men who who hold the direct power that beauty attempts to manipulate. This is in the model of Referent Power and holds similar flaws to Reward power in in its lack of directness.\n\nAnd it should be stated, that women's beauty is something not inherent to womanhood. Much has been written about the nature of beauty standards, and how existing outside of beauty standards can have bad consequences for women.\n\n**Presumed Innocence\/Moral Authority Power**\n\nGoldich asserts that this power is based in a natural human reaction to women's more innocent and cherubic appearance. Thus, the same issues with so-called Beauty Power carry over here. He also cites a vague primal association with women and motherhood, leading us to trust them more, especially in a court of law. This is another case of Referent Power. In terms of game theory, it's another social power. It only works if a person that holds direct power is swayed by it. We also do not apparently ascribe the authoritative role of Fatherhood with men, for some reason.\n\n**Majority-Vote Power**\n\nIn America, more women than men vote and the population has slightly more women than men. This is not an individually held power as a single vote alone does not influence anything. This would be a form of legitimate power, and is the weakest form of it. Legitimate power is the inherent authority of a person based on their duties within an organization. In this case, the organization is the Country and the position is Citizen. If women voted as a hivemind then this would be a very effective power. In reality, the individual influence is low.\n\n**Net Worth Power**\n\nGoldich cites women's \"greater power to demand alimony and child support payments and keep the family home\". Apparently this power only works in divorce? It's also nonsensical, as Alimony is gender neutral and based on income, it's not something that one demands by virtue of their gender. Similarly, child support payments are ordered to be paid to the person who has custody of children, of which women tend to receive. And, once again, this so-called FemalePower is an appeal (if it could be called one) to an actual source of direct power: the state.\n\nGoldich goes on to assert that Women as head of household have an average net worth 41% higher than their male equivalents, but cites a [1984 census](https:\/\/www2.census.gov\/library\/publications\/1989\/compendia\/statab\/109ed\/1989-04.pdf) to demonstrate this effect. More [recent data](https:\/\/socwomen.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/fact_2-2010-wealth.pdf) contradicts the narrative.\n\nIt's not clear what power to achieve outcomes Goldich sees within having a higher networth.\n\n**Spending Power**\n\nGoldich concedes that men do earn more, but women have more power over spending, citing advertisements targetted towards women. It is unclear to me how doing the shopping for a household could be considered a power, as having an advertisement targetted at you trying to get you to spend more money doesn't appear to lead to any likelihood of being able to achieve your preferred outcomes. This obviously doesn't fit into any of the conceptions of power of either framework.\n\n**Procreation Power**\n\nGoldich says \"Her choice is his fate\" in regards to women's ability to choose procreation. Obviously this power has caveats given the Texas abortion bill, and further Goldich misunderstands the purpose and use of child drop off centers. In all these cases, it is the state, not women, who hold the power to make these determinations. It is not something wielded my individual women.\n\nMore interestingly, he ascribes the power to shape each successive generation as a power held by women. This is an interesting way to frame women being shoehorned into the role of domestic carer as a power that women supposedly hold over the next generation.\n\n**Domestic Power**\n\n\"The greater power to rule the roost, set the social calendar, and weave the social fabric. The greater power to choose between fulltime arduous work, fulltime easy work, part-time work, volunteer work, or fulltime parenting.\"\n\nQuoted in full for this one, since it is a little unfocused. It appears that Goldich is perhaps projecting a particular relationship dynamic on his assessment of general female power. Men are often regarded as the defacto authority in the household. Maybe he feels henpecked by his wife or something?\n\nAlso, the \"greater power to choose [types of labor]\" is a canard. There is no evidence that women have this more free choice. It wouldn't make sense, for instance, given the author's assessment that women more often take custody of children in divorce, to frame working a full time job and taking care of the kids as a power.\n\n**The Greater Power To Elicit Empathy**\n\nIt appears Goldich did not attempt to validate this power. He writes one sentence about it and then talks about a related power and makes a misogynistic joke. The sentence:\n\n\"This is the power that raises only female concerns to the level of major societal concerns.\"\n\nObviously this is false given the vast amount of male concerns that are considered major but not specifically framed as a male issue. I think Goldich might have spent too much time being angry about feminists and is conflating jezebel articles with things that are actually parsed as major societal concerns.\n\nThe bonus related power that he talked about: \"And there is the related power of verbal\/emotional acuity\" I have seen no evidence that women are generally more well spoken then men.\n\n**Power of Protection Under Chivalry**\n\nThis one is just funny, and as the article goes on I admit that I am having a harder and harder time taking it seriously. I leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine the flaws with conceiving of being protected from earning money because it is \"the root of all evil\" as a power held by women.\n\n**The Power to Shame**\n\nThis is apparently the power to shame men's sexuality and make them feel as less of a man. Obviously this fits no models of power as have been defined. There would be a case to be made if women posessed legitimate power and were speaking with authority, but this has not been demonstrated.\n\n**Academia Power**\n\nGoldich cites 90% of grade school teachers are female (you know, *academia*). He then conflates this number with a greater power to determine curricula at a college level. I guess he doesn't know that the majority of professors at the college level are men. Perhaps he mislabeled this FemalePower? \n\n**The Power of Feminism Itself**\n\nAlmighty feminism! He calls this the power of victimhood (an oxymoron), power to define terms (anyone can) the power to control media, etc. etc. It is basically a rehash of the above powers but situated specifically in a gender political context.\n\n---\n\nThat's all 14. As I wrote it I realized that applying the models of power as I had set out to do was like bringing a gun to a rubber chicken fight. Goldich's assessment of FemalePower is not an academic or realistic look of how power operates sociologically, it is rather a laundry list of typical male grievances framing women as the perpetrators.\n\nAll 14 share the common trait of being indirect forms of power. That is to say, that they are not effective at all without the capitulation of holders of real power. As an exercise to the readers, I would have you pick an outcome that a woman may want to see realized and describe how one could wield one of the above powers (those that have actually been demonstrated to have a hint of truth that is) to achieve that outcome without somehow involving a person with coercive or legitimate power to use that power to reach that goal.\n\nI will also add that this was the document referenced to suggest that women's power across history was equal but different to the power of men. Many of them would be disqualified from proving this point by existence alone, for example, women not being able to have \"net worth power\" at a time where they were generally not permitted to own property, or \"majority vote power\" when they had no right to vote, or \"power of feminism itself\" at a time before feminism.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there something I missed? Is there a conception of female power that Goldich left out that you think bears considering? Did I treat Goldich unfairly?\n\nEdit: u\/petrol_sexual wrote this and I figured it was a fine addition to post as a discussion prompt:\n\n>I think it would be important to consider men's perspective on how they react to female forms of power as well as women's perspective of how much influence they can achieve.\n\nSo, if you'd like, include what gender you identify as and what your thoughts are on this.","title":"14 Modes of Female Power","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/qi0s37\/14_modes_of_female_power\/","upvote_ratio":0.74,"over_18":false}

My thought is that this could still have little to do with the program or type of treatment.  It could be that being part of a group for an extended period of time offers it's own benefits.  Such as developing close relationships and trust with other clients.\n\n**Do Batterer Programs Reduce Recidivism? Results from a Randomized Trial in the Bronx**\n\n https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07418820802024945?src=recsys\n\n> The study found that neither the batterer program nor either of the two monitoring schedules produced a reduction in official re\u2010arrest rates for any offense, for domestic violence, or for domestic violence with the same victim.\n\nWhile this doesn't specifically mention the Duluth Model, DV treatment is similar in approach, using Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  I've noticed that studies researching effectiveness lump the Duluth Model in with other treatments without mentioning any significant difference between them.\n\n**Do Duluth Model Interventions With Perpetrators of Domestic Violence Violate Mental Health Professional Ethics?**\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10508420903035323\n\n> In spite of numerous studies of program outcomes finding little or no positive effect on violent behavior, the Duluth model remains the most common program type of interventions with perpetrators of domestic violence. In addition, Duluth model programs often ignore serious mental health and substance abuse issues present in perpetrators. These and other issues of possible threat to mental health professional ethics are reviewed in light of the court-mandated, compulsory nature of most Duluth model programs and client and victim expectations for program efficacy.\n\nI tend to agree with the spirit of this. How ethical is it if a person has the choice between jail and treatment, as far as their relationship with the therapist goes.  \n\nAnd, finally this addresses the tailored type of treatment mentioned in the above abstract.\n\n**Intimate Partner Violence Perpetrator Treatment: Tailoring Interventions to Individual Needs**\n\nhttps:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10615-020-00763-y\n\n>  Specifically, practitioners should be aware of (1) demographic factors affecting treatment completion and re-assault, (2) perpetrator typologies, (3) perpetrator readiness to change and use of motivation-based approaches, and (4) common individual co-occurring concerns, including substance use and mental health issues.\n\nI think trauma informed care is also important for the men and women needing this type of intervention and treatment.  \n\nI don't know what people want to say about this.  But my biggest question is why a program that doesn't work continues to be used.  Institutional capture by a particular type of feminism?  People with power seeing this as going through the motions and covering their asses?   ???","title":"Is the Duluth Model Effective?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/nfq2oz\/is_the_duluth_model_effective\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

Showing some kind of victimization or the perpetuation of some kind of unjust system accumulates a lot of attention. And this is because when people see injustice they get outraged, and that outrage then turns into social capital\u2026 My gripe is that this makes social justice incredibly vulnerable to opportunists: people who want to turn their victimization into capital gains.\u201d  \n>  \n>9:23: \u201c\\[Me Too\\] evolved into a movement that primarily focused around the sexual violence directed towards rich white women in Hollywood: hyper-visible actresses... The narrative was appropriated trivially, and absorbed into a system where ruthless careerism and exploitation is the norm, and fighting for status is the primary aim of its denizens. The new colonization of victimhood is perfect for those looking to become culturally relevant. This acts as an easy and bulletproof way to gain social capital: careerism disguised as 'social justice'.\u201d  \n>  \n>12:02: \u201cIn a culture where victimhood is enshrined in such a hamfisted way, it is almost impossible to criticize a victim without looking like you\u2019re further contributing to their victimization, even if you have valid questions to ask. This creates a class of people that are immune to critique, and this is incredibly dangerous. It also creates a class of people that will shout you down if you dare question a motive that you perceive to be unsavoury.\u201d  \n>  \n>13:03: \u201cIt is a marriage of the algorithm\u2019s metrics and careerist capitalism that encourages these kinds of self-interested motives. Because of this, we see people taking social justice out of its proper context and presenting it as a commodity to be consumed. And attention equals power\u2026 There are people who are looking to manipulate us by using our rhetoric and taking advantage of our good will in order to establish power and social capital for themselves.\u201d  \n>  \n>14:40: \u201cCallouts, whether completely genuine or based on the flimsiest stories, are in fact an exchange of social capital. The fact that one simply knows and acts with certainty creates an authority by virtue of appearance\u2026 Just like with material capitalism, the ability to exploit social capital means some eventually will\u2026 There is an incentive for bad faith, to misinterpret or misrepresent. And when this happens, it is almost always done in the aim of gaining social capital at the expense of the other person\u2026 To exercise scrutiny on all parties and all elements of a story is infinitely less likely to hurt the innocent.\u201d  \n>  \n>18:52: \"Capitalism can cultivate an identity from anything: enjoyment of movies, video games, music, sexual attraction, and much more. But now oppression and suffering are being turned into identities that capitalism is in the process of monetizing and modifying. Oppression and suffering are the new metrics by which we measure our identity.\"  \n>  \n>21:09: \u201cThe liberal appropriation of social justice isn\u2019t really about empowerment. It\u2019s about creating a category of perpetual victimhood that can be mined for social capital, without actually challenging the systems that perpetuate victimhood in the first place..... It shifts the focus away from any kind of action that makes a material difference in people's lives, and into the realm of the accumulation and management of social capital.\u201d  \n>  \n>22:10: \u201cIdentity should never be used as a means to assert and accumulate power. Identity should never ever be used as a shield from criticism. And most importantly, identity should never be seen as a merit in and of itself.\u201d  \n>  \n>23:58: \u201cIt all starts with formulating some kind of coherent vision for actually what it is that we want to create, and then taking the steps to get there gradually. How can we be different? How can we subvert the metrics that already exist? How can we create our own? How can we safeguard ourselves against opportunistic attention-seekers by creating a culture that does not encourage and reward it?\u201d\n\nI figure this might spark some debate here. Also, since she's a rare member of the feminist left who's willing to somewhat criticize its dark side, I suggest we all watch her video and thereby increase her social capital! And if you leave a comment on her video, try to be polite and rational.","title":"Leftist critique of the social justice \"clout game\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/aphkad\/leftist_critique_of_the_social_justice_clout_game\/","upvote_ratio":0.97,"over_18":false}

This is partly based on anecdotal evidence, and passive observation, so if I'm wrong, please feel free to discuss that as well. In any case, the example I'll work with, is how posting something critical to feminism on the feminism subreddit is likely to get you banned, while posting something critical to the MRM in the mensrights subreddit gets you a lot of downvotes and rather salty replies, but generally leaves you post up. Another example would be the relatively few number of feminists in this subreddit, despite feminism in general being far bigger than anti-feminism.\n\nBut, I'll be working on the assumption that this observation is correct. Why is it that feminist spaces are harder on dissenting voices than their counterparts, and less often go to debate those who disagree. In that respect, I'll dot down suggestions.\n\n* The moderators of those spaces happen to be less tolerant\n* The spaces get more frequent dissenting posts, and thus have to ban them to keep on the subject.\n* There is little interest in opening up a debate, as they have the dominant narrative, and allowing it to be challenged would yield no reward, only risk.\n* The ideology is inherently less open to debate, with a focus on experiences and feelings that should not be invalidated.\n* Anti-feminists are really the odd ones out, containing an unusually high density of argumentative people\n\nJust some lazy Sunday thoughts, I'd love to hear your take on it.","title":"Openness to debate.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4moubo\/openness_to_debate\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

This number suggests that approximately 12 people harm themselves for every reported death by suicide. However, because of the way these data are collected, we are not able to distinguish intentional suicide attempts from non-intentional self-harm behaviors.\n\n>Many suicide attempts, however, go unreported or untreated. Surveys suggest that at least one million people in the U.S. each year engage in intentionally inflicted self-harm.\n\n\nConsidering how counting attempts is so hard I was surprised to read the next paragraph which didn't leave much room for uncertainty:\n>Females attempt suicide three times more often than males. As with suicide deaths, rates of attempted suicide vary considerably among demographic groups. While males are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. The ratio of suicide attempts to suicide death in youth is estimated to be about 25:1, compared to about 4:1 in the elderly.\n\nThe source given by AFSP for the webpage is: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Data & Statistics Fatal Injury Report for 2014.\n\nThe Data & Statistics Fatal Injury Report only looked at fatal injuries (that is that any suicide counted there were successful and thus any attempts weren't counted). CDC does have a non-fatal injury report and that has a intentional \"self harm\" category. In 2014 184.000 men were admitted to hospital with self-harm injuries while 281.000 women were admitted to hospital with self-harm injuries. [Source (.csv file from CDC)](http:\/\/webappa.cdc.gov\/cgi-bin\/broker.exe?_service=v8prod&_server=aspv-wisq-1.cdc.gov&_port=5099&_sessionid=lpXOt4JUO52&_program=wisqnf.downcsv.sas&csvfile=results&_debug=0)\n\nAlthough this show that more women than men are admitted with injuries caused by self-harming it's nowhere close to the 3 to 1 ratio AFSP claims on their web-page.\n\nThe self-harm category in the Non-fatal injury report (which can be queried [here](http:\/\/webappa.cdc.gov\/sasweb\/ncipc\/nfirates2001.html)) is not a very reliant approximation of suicide attempts as it probably includes non-intentional self-harming injuries as well as self-harming which isn't suicide attempts - like some forms of self-cutting.\n\n\nInterestingly enough CDC actually does have some more accurate numbers of suicide attempts. Numbers obtained by actually asking a large sample about suicidal thoughts, suicide plans and suicide attempts: [Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors Among Adults Aged \u226518 Years --- United States, 2008-2009](http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/ss6013a1.htm)\n\nThe sample size for this study was 92,264 respondents.\n\nLet me quote from their *results* section:\n>The prevalence of suicidal thoughts was significantly higher among females than it was among males, but there was **no statistically significant difference for suicide planning or suicide attempts**.\n\n\nDo note that when they write \"significantly\" they mean statistically significant - the difference isn't very large:\n\n* **Suicidal thoughts**:\n3.5% of the adult male population and 3.9% of the adult female population had suicidal thoughts in the past year.\n\n\n* **Suicide plans**:\n1.0% of the adult male population and 1.0% of the female population made suicide plans in the past year.\n\n\n* **Suicide attempts**:\n0.4% of the adult male population and 0.5% of the adult female population attempted suicide in the past year.\n\n\n\nAnd again we see the pattern (as we have with sexual violence and domestic violence) that when men are asked they report a higher rate than previously thought and what statistics based in police and health services would indicate. What I get from that is that men don\u2019t ask for help. I think a large part of why they don\u2019t ask for help is because they\u2019re discouraged to do so by our society, by our society\u2019s reluctance to address male issues.\n\n","title":"Suicide attempts and how men are ignored","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/4j5cuz\/suicide_attempts_and_how_men_are_ignored\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

You could give financial support to people working to keep their traditions alive through events, art, and activism.

And really do more harm than good really especially when it seems a lot of feminists want other cultures to be integrated and be represented in the US.  \n\nAs by various feminists pushing for such a thing, they are making it so there is no cultural integration.  And such you won't have what has happened and is still going on in the music word where it takes various music styles from other cultures and combine them with others.  As pushing for cultural appropriation stops such things from happening.  \n\nDon't get me wrong there are things that whites shouldn't do like black face (not that it shouldn't be taught in terms of history tho).  But I think people from other cultures want others to take in and take on their cultural in terms of acceptance and it being part of their society.

Based on the glowing reviews I was expecting her to have a deeper awareness of the way men suffer from sexism, not as blowback from their sexism against women but as a result of sexism against men.\n\n> Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. \n\nBut men aren\u2019t the enemy?\n\nThis really is sounding a lot like the author views feminism as some form of Marxist class struggle. This is a totally wrong and counterproductive model for gender issues.\n\nSeeing men as the ruling class really does make them the bad guy in your world view.\n\n> These career-based changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. \n\nI\u2019m impressed with her insight and honesty about this. Although again, I think we are coming at it from different directions. She seems to think that the result of feminism-as-a-career-option is that feminists are not radical enough. I think that it encourages what some have called \u201cfainting couch feminism\u201d where people are just looking for things to make a fuss about.\n\n> With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a \"victim\" of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a \"feminist.\" Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women. \n\nI have to acknowledge this. I\u2019m impressed that she would say this. There\u2019s definitely some positives to take from this book.\n\n> Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. \n\nA semi-positive statement. Although I ask how I would convince a feminist that I have \u201cdivested of male privilege\u201d and I\u2019m also concerned that this male who now has no male privilege also lacks the female privilege she\u2019s made no mention of giving up.\n\n> As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined. \n\nMy concern here is that she\u2019s so far only displayed awareness of sexism against women. I worry that she has no issue with women holding on to sexist attitudes against men.","title":"Reading \"Feminism is for everybody\" by bell hooks - 2: CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FeMRADebates\/comments\/3crsee\/reading_feminism_is_for_everybody_by_bell_hooks_2\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}
