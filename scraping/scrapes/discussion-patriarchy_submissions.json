I said that when we use phrases like \u201cit\u2019s all men,\u201d we run the risk of alienating people who might actually be open to learning\u2014but aren\u2019t fully informed yet. That kind of broad messaging, while emotionally charged and understandable, often pushes people away who otherwise might have listened.\n\nI said that when people feel lumped in or talked down to, it creates resentment, and that resentment is exactly the kind of thing people like Andrew Tate feed on. He positions himself as the guy who \u201cgets\u201d them when everyone else calls them trash. And sadly, that works.\n\nWhat happened next?\nI got told to shut the fuck up.\nI got lectured on patriarchy like I hadn\u2019t already acknowledged it.\nI got dismissed as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d just for suggesting that strategy and communication matter.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the part that really pisses me off: I\u2019ve been hurt by women, too. Manipulated. Lied to. Emotionally torn apart. But I\u2019ve never walked away saying \u201cit\u2019s all women.\u201d I didn\u2019t become bitter. I didn\u2019t stop caring. I stuck around. I tried to be better. And when I finally speak up\u2014calmly, mind you\u2014just to say, \u201cHey, maybe there\u2019s a more effective way to reach people,\u201d I get shut down like I\u2019m the damn enemy.\n\nApparently, trying to critique the language means I\u2019m tone policing.\nApparently, giving a damn about how the message is received means I\u2019m fragile.\nApparently, caring about the cause but wanting it to actually work means I\u2019m just another guy in denial.\n\nI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just tired.\n\nTired of trying to be thoughtful and getting talked over.\nTired of making space for everyone else\u2019s experience while being told mine doesn\u2019t matter.\nTired of being treated like a punching bag just because I had the nerve to speak from the heart.\n\nCritique is not opposition.\nAsking if the message is effective is not tone policing.\nTrying to reach people who aren\u2019t already in the choir isn\u2019t betrayal\u2014it\u2019s strategy.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing a lot of people don\u2019t want to hear: this exact dynamic is part of why so many young men are being pushed into right-wing spaces and even voted for Trump.\nNot because they\u2019re inherently evil or hate women\u2014but because they feel unheard, dismissed, and villainized no matter what they say. When the only people who will \u201clisten\u201d to them are the loudest extremists, it creates a pipeline no one wants to admit exists.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there.\nThis isn\u2019t just about Tate. It\u2019s not just about Trump.\nThis kind of messaging\u2014and the way criticism of it is shut down\u2014is feeding a broader feedback loop on social media that is actively worsening the gender divide. You can see it everywhere: men and women talking past each other, mocking each other, retreating into increasingly hostile echo chambers.\nAnd it\u2019s not just digital noise. It\u2019s having real-world consequences. Loneliness. Extremism. Distrust. Broken relationships. Polarization. And if we keep pretending that pushing away nuance is the right path forward, things are only going to get worse.\n\nI care about this. I care about people. I care about real change.\n\nBut sometimes, it feels like caring just makes you a target.\n\nThanks for letting me get this off my chest.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nI tried to respectfully critique the phrase \u201cit\u2019s all men\u201d and got shut down, insulted, and labeled part of the problem. I wasn\u2019t denying patriarchy\u2014I was pointing out that this kind of language can alienate potential allies, fuel resentment, and feed toxic figures like Andrew Tate. It\u2019s not tone policing to ask if the message is actually working. This kind of one-sided messaging is worsening the gender divide on social media and in real life, and it\u2019s already having serious consequences. I care\u2014and I\u2019m exhausted from being treated like the enemy just for saying so.","title":"I tried to speak up about the phrase \u201cit\u2019s all men\u201d and got told to shut the f*** up.
