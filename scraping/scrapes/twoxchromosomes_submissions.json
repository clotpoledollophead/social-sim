That statement above was dropped in the middle of dinner. Unpromted. \n\nBefore that little comments were said.\n\n\"Don't worry CoroBora, we'll pay since this is a pretty expensive place you probably didn't know.\"...... Okay Man I picked it out and I invited you. \n\n\"What happened to that last girl you were dating? Her name was Megan! Oh she was such a lady! She was so sweet and her hair was so gorgeous and tame.\" - Megan is now a Michael and transitioned FtM. Okay so you don't like my natural wild afro\n\nFood arrives and I ask for a bottle of wine, and a slice of my SO favorite dessert to be brought to the table, because my nerves need it for faking it through this and he was showing amazing restraint. I purposefully told my SO to be calm before dinner and let them run the show to see how they'll be. We talked about if it went sideways, that this is also his opportunity to cut ties with them if he chooses. So don't worry he's plenty protective, but I had him in off mode tonight lol. \n\n\"I don't think it's wise to order that wine, and he doesn't need that cake. \" - well it ain't for you and he loves that cake. So he gets cake. \n\nMy SO brings up a wedding we attended Via Zoom lol to lighten the mood and they made a face and.. our waiter came back with that wine at the right time and cake slice.. because you know once you open the bottle, pour, and sip it's on your tab. I only got one sip and I didnt even swallow it before that shit came out my mouth from what his parents said. \"If you have a child with my son in the future, we will not love them the same way we love our other grandchildren, because they will be half black. If marriage is in your cards with him forget it  I hope it doesn't last. We just believe that he would be happier with some one of a lighter tone of skin.\" \n\nOur waiter hadn't even left the table so props to him for keeping that bottle steady while pouring after the bomb drop, but the face he made. His eyes wide as hell. \n\nAll I did was look at my SO for him to just deflate, kiss my cheek, gathered his coat and my purse,  and he went to get the car without a word. It was painful for me to watch him  because I knew he was reall hurt, he loved his parents, but he didn't want to be apart of that anymore and even though we are not having children it's still a slap  to the face to hear that and disturbing. \n\nWhile I  sat there and looked at both his parents and wonder how the hell their son turned out so perfect.\nI stood up because at this point, I realized I don't want to be on the same level as them, plus there is no reason to keep this quiet and if you wanna play ball like that you're going to be outed. \"For your son and I to even be in your presence is so offensive, having dinner with racist!! I cannot believe I thought you could be civil like a normal human being. I won't make that mistake again neither will he. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my time on you both and made an effort to meet you, while I could have instead treated us both to a much better dinner with company who is far superior and foward thinking than you two.\" \nI picked this restaurant for a reason, it's expensive af and I had saved for this night because I had Intended on paying because  it's where we had our first lunch date and it also has that Raspberry dessert that my SO loves and I mainly wanted him to have that comfort tonight. \n\"Since you so graciously offered to pay enjoy the bill and tip our black server the amount you would've tipped a Caucasian one. Because I now believe that your racism will play a part in how you tip him!\" I said this loudly and people turned their heads to look. His parents got red face, but I picked up the plate of cake and turned and walked to the door where my man was standing\n\nI felt powerful \n\nI felt confident \n\nI felt extremely angry\n\nI grabbed his hand \n\nAnd right when I walked out the door and it closed my legs shook, my breathing sped up, and I clung to him. We leaned on each other for support as we left and pulled off a few miles down the road to let  him have a moment to gather himself.\n\nHe broke the silence by asking for his cake. No utensils so we ate with our hands laughing, because I stole a plate from the restaurant, but he said I looked like a bad bitch doing it. After we were done we turned the car around, stopped at a bank to get a 50$, and went back to the restaurant  to return the plate and ask for our server.\n\nIt was a shit night, up until we were eating cake with our fingers on the side of the road laughing. We had known the night would have been bad, but we didn't know that those words would've been said. It has really been messing with me though.\n\n\n\nEDIT: WOW! I did not expect this to gain so fast and its a bit overwhelming. I am reading all of your replies, but I don't think I'll be able to keep up with the comments. However, I do want you to know that I do appreciate all support that you all have given me and my SO. \u2764\ufe0f","title":"If you have a child with my son in the future, we will not love them the same way we love our other grandchildren, because they will be half black.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/led753\/if_you_have_a_child_with_my_son_in_the_future_we\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false}

She said she\u2019d be right back and disappeared, bringing back a doctor. \n\nAs the doctor spoke I cried and when he left the room I screamed. It felt like my heart was torn in a million pieces. I was told to go home and I\u2019d be given further instructions. My doctor called and told me she wanted me to come in for a D&C, which is the medical term for an abortion. She said it was for my own health that they recommend I do it that day. So that day I spent hours at the hospital and when I got home I wasn\u2019t pregnancy anymore. \n\nI was told there was a genetic disorder. That even if I did give birth to a full grown baby they would likely not have survived or be extremely disabled and if I had waited I could have put myself through pain, extreme bleeding and risk of infection if my body \u201cnaturally\u201d miscarried. \n\nWhen I tell people this story they often look uncomfortable and they should be. Because this is what we are being forced to do - because my choice is at risk of being taken away and my life is being put at risk by a bunch of clueless strangers who think they have a right to control my body. I never wanted  an abortion, no one does. We *need* them and the right to have medical procedures be discussed between me and my doctor, not me and a stranger.\n\nIf anyone else out there has had to get an abortion, tell your story. Let\u2019s make everyone feel as uncomfortable and upset as we are.","title":"For every person that believes they would never get an abortion","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/umhhkm\/for_every_person_that_believes_they_would_never\/","upvote_ratio":0.84,"over_18":false}

I had made so many life style changes, started reading baby books, was taking my prenatal vitamins, and already seeing a physician about possible fertility issue just in case. Finally, on June 4th, I had a positive pregnancy test. My husband and I both cried, it was probably the best day of our lives.\n\nWe were overzealous and though we knew miscarriage was an option, you can't convince yourself it will happen to you. We started preparing immediately, buying baby stuff, making lists, and I had a dr's appointment and my first ultrasound scheduled within days.\n\nOn Wednesday, my baby was supposed to be 9 weeks and 3 days. We went to the ultrasound and there my baby was. It was there and everything I wanted. Even though I could see it, and it seemed so perfect, I felt in my gut something was wrong because the ultrasound tech was quiet. The silence was deafening and I was convincing myself she was quiet because she wasn't the Dr and wasn't allowed to talk about it. After what felt like 10-15 minutes of pictures, she pulled the ultrasound back to my baby and zoomed back in. She started talking finally. \"And there's your baby, there's the yolk, and the sac... I am so sorry but there is no heartbeat.\"\n\nShe just sat there, with my baby on the screen, the probe still in my vagina, as I cried and all my husband could do is grab my leg. Eventually she pulled it out and told me she would be back with a Dr. We sat in there for twenty minutes, crying. I spiraled through all the emotions possible grief, anger, fear, guilt, and denial. I almost convinced myself that once the Dr saw the pictures he would know the baby was fine, and the technician was wrong.\n\nThe Dr came in and confirmed the baby was not viable. They are able to tell in two ways, one by some measurement (I cannot remember what it was) and by not having a heartbeat. My baby was not viable for both reasons.\n\nThe Dr talked with us for a long time and was very kind, but it was so confusing and hard. Miscarriage is confusing and not enough people talk about it. He told me I had a few options: 1) wait to see if my body miscarries by itself. I was not showing signs of miscarriage, and my baby was still there. He said this could take weeks and if the process begins it can take weeks. He said if I do this, I need to monitor for heavy bleeding, extreme pain\/cramping, fevers, shortness of breath, and chills. I asked, well isn't miscarrying going to produce heavy bleeding and extreme cramping? His answer was yes. Then how do I know if I need to go to the emergency room? He said well go if you think you need to. If my body did not miscarry itself, I could get sick from sepsis and would put myself at risk and possibly need more emergent care. 2) Take a medical intervention (misoprostol). This will cause the miscarriage and most of it will be done between 24 and 48 hours. 3) Do a D&C, a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue.\n\nThe Dr. scheduled me an appointment for the very next day to figure out what we wanted to do. The next day I was with a new Dr to me, but a Dr they specifically chosen because she had dealt with this with patients before and she told me she has went through it herself. Wednesday night, I had extremely cramping and heavy bleeding. I believed this was likely my miscarriage, and it had happened naturally. I told the Dr what had happened, and again realized I knew nothing about miscarriages. She said it could have been. It could have been some of it, could have been none of it. She said I still had the option to wait it out naturally, but again this could lead to it's own risks. We talked through all the options again, and my husband and I agreed the misoprostol was the best option. This way we would know it was done and wouldn't have to live in fear waiting. And to be honest, I couldn't live with knowing my dead baby was inside me any longer.\n\nThese are abortion pills. These are what you take when you need an abortion. Let me tell you why I fucking know first hand why no one uses this shit was birth control. I was so scared to take these pills. \"Expect extreme cramping and bleeding, but also go to the emergency room if you have extreme cramping and bleeding.\" It was all so confusing. \"Be warry of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dizziness.\" Expect extreme pain, but just rotate between over the counter Tylenol and ibuprofen. Know this could go on for up to 48 hours. Stay home.\n\nAnd at the end she said \"When you go to the pharmacy, they are going to ask if you are pregnant. If you say yes, they will not give them to you. Tell them instead you are having an active miscarriage\".\n\nOur hell wasn't over. Now we get to go to a Walgreens pharmacy and have to be asked an intrusive question and answer it in front of everyone. You ever been to a Walgreen's pharmacy???????? There is no fucking privacy.  I already had a pit in my gut, I am in Missouri, I was ready for the judgement.\n\nI went to the Walgreen's pharmacy attached to the medical center I was at. I thought it would be safe and they would be the most understanding. And they were... but they did haven't the prescription. She told me she could order it for tomorrow (Friday). My husband had to leave for work on Saturday and I didn't want to be going through this alone, so I told her I needed it today. She told me to try another Walgreens.\n\nWe went to the next Walgreens. I asked the technician to check if they had it before they filled it, because I needed it today. She checked and said it was available and they would get it filled. I felt some relief and was ready to get this one nightmare over with and start the next. Then she came out, and she said she was so sorry but the pharmacist refused to fill it.\n\nThe pharmacist refused to fill it. It hadn't clicked in my head what was going on, I asked why, she said he said the \"dose was too high\". I gave them my medical paper work (I was not thinking, I just was panicked and wanted this over with). She gave it back to him and came back and just said he refused to fill it. That's it. I asked what I can do, what I need to do. She said she didn't know, there was nothing.\n\nTo be honest, I cursed and I cried. I am embarrassed but have I not fucking been through enough? have I not fucking suffered enough? My husband and I went back to the car and we called the original pharmacy, I was crying and yelling and they were so nice. They worked to figure out what they could do for me, and they ended up being able to fill it by giving me a shit ton of lower dosage pills. Thank you to those brilliant angels that went out of their way because they realized how much I needed just some fucking human decency.\n\nI bled a lot on the pills. I cramped a lot and it hurt. I cried a lot and I miss my baby.\n\nAnd then Friday I was told Roe vs Wade was gone. And I have heard so many people over and over again say this won't hurt women who are having miscarriages and how we are overreacting.\n\nI can tell you right now, the day before it was even gone, that I was denied my medication I needed for my miscarriage. I was denied it in Missouri by a male pharmacist. Right now, it hurts too much, but I am going to call and get his name and file a formal complaint, but this will not end. This will get worse.\n\nI am so scared to have a baby now. This process hurt so much and was so evil and such a fucking nightmare. And now it will be worse. I am so scared of how I will be treated if this happens again. We don't deserve this, no one deserves this.\n\nI was always pro-choice because it's none of my damn business what other women do with their bodies. But I wanted to share my story, because so many people keeping fucking spouting how this won't affect women who have miscarriages.\n\nFUCK YOU to every single one of those people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I want to say thank you for everyone's kindness. After this situation and then all the Roe vs Wade discussion right afterwards, I was feeling very negative, helpless, and alone. This has made me feel much stronger, more hopeful, and now angry.\n\nMy family filed complaints by calling this customer service number:  Company\/Store Inquiries or *Complaints*: (toll-free) 1-800-*WALGREENS* (1-800-925-4733) . Please be warned, some of them were moved around a few times and on hold a few times.

With these details, Walgreens will know who the person was and I will not have to share a name.\n\nThe entire situation:\n\n\\- Called them on our way to their location at 3:58 PM, the technician that answered kept getting our last name spelt wrong and would not answer if they could fill it today.\n\n\\- Arrive there around 6-8 minutes later, gave details to technician at the counter and asked if she could see if they could fill it today.\n\n\\- Technician checked and said yes it was available and went to process the medication.\n\n\\- We waited at the chairs in the lobby. The technician came out and said the pharmacist refused to fill the medication, the dosage was too high. I asked what we could do, she said he called our original Walgreens pharmacy (the one that did not have the specific dosage I needed on hand) and they did not answer (WE WILL GET BACK TO THIS). I asked if we could call our physician. She did not respond.\n\n\\- THE DOSAGE WAS FOR 600 MICROGRAMS OF MISOPROSTOL EVERY 6 HOURS FOR 24 HOURS. YOU CAN EASILY GOOGLE THIS IS ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER END OF DOSAGES FOR MISCARRIAGE.\n\n\\- Gave the technician my paperwork to give to the pharmacist (I should not have done this, but was panicked and did not know what to do)\n\n\\- She took it back to him, came back and just said he would not fill it.\n\n\\- Asked what I can do? Can I call my physician? What if I call the other pharmacy?\n\n\\- She did not respond or give any advice.\n\n\\- The pharmacist NEVER CAME TO SPEAK TO ME. Never.\n\n\\- I cried and cursed. Sorry to the technician, but no one would help me or give me any information.\n\n\\- Left and went to my car. Immediately called the original Walgreens pharmacy. They answered immediately and said they never received a call. I told them about the situation, she was silent and said they were not going to fill it, and started working with me to get it figured out there.","title":"I had a miscarriage on Wednesday.

Come on, it is just a hug.\" I have learned not to JADE from my Reddit use (thanks Reddit!) so I answer with \"I said 'no' and I meant it.\" I then proceed try to walk passed him, ignoring anything else he says but he blocks my way.\n\nHe says he will hug me anyway. I stop trying to get passed him, look at him straight in his face and with a polite smile I tell him that no, he will not hug me against my will and if he does try to I will not only punch him in his face but that I will get away with it and he will end up the one fired. \n\nHe gives me a confused look and just says \"No, you would get fired?\" Which is when the kitchen manager (who could overhear our conversation from the prep area) grabbed him, removed him from the time card area, and told him \"Noooo, she's right, you would get fired and she more than likely wouldn't even get a write-up.\" I clocked out and left pleased with how I handled myself. \n\nThis morning while I'm clocking in for my shift the kitchen manager asks if I have a second to talk. I say sure cause I'm a little early. He tells me he had a very quick conversation with the new cook about sexual harassment. He said because of the complete lack of understanding on this guys part, he called the owner and set up a mandatory company wide meeting with a specialist to go over not just sexual harassment but consent as well. He said if this guy gives me or anyone trouble to let him know. \n\nSo I left work last night proud of how I handled myself and left today proud of how my employers are handling themselves.

You will change astronomically in your teens and twenties - these are formative years in your life. The person you are today will be so significantly different from the person you will be this time next year. There is literally nothing you have in common with a grown ass man, unless that grown ass man is also mentally 16 years old (which, huge yikes). You are not mature for your age. Older women are not just \"jealous\" of you (I don't even know why that narrative is spun). There's a reason why these men can't find age appropriate women, and it's because they truly suck so much that they seek out naive and docile young women with no life experience who won't judge them for how tremendously they suck.\n\nTake advice from the lived experiences of thousands and thousands of women who have come before you and don't want you to repeat their mistakes: sis he's not in love with you, he's in love with the idea of you.\n\nETA: Did not expect this to blow up the way it did.

Some things aren\u2019t fixable to me and there\u2019s no going back. To some it\u2019s cheating or abuse.\nWhile there was no physical abuse my boyfriend watched me be verbally abused. I gave him a choice and he took it. I will not explain this again through pms.\n\nFor those saying that I cleaned him out and was unfair during the split process- you only know a small part of my story guys. I spent a lot more money towards this house and I felt it was fair to keep it.\nI did not take it from him as some are saying. I paid for his half and paid him for a little equity. He agreed to the number. If he didn\u2019t we would of sold the house.\nAlso, I am not complaining about him taking our shared dishes. \nI was at work and when I came home 90% of my appliances and furniture was gone. My kitchen cabinets were empty, even all my baking stuff and he never baked. My couches were gone, lamps, etc.\nSo I\u2019m not being petty over a few items.\nI wouldn\u2019t of minded him taking half of the stuff but it seems like they took items to just spite me. \nIt was never my intention to not be fair with him or to bleed him dry. \n\nEdit- to all the threatening messages and garbage, you\u2019re wasting your time.

I don\u2019t know how to link, but it\u2019s in my post history.\n\nHis biggest issue with me was that I would throw away my wrapped (in tissue and a plastic bag to please him) tampons in the trash in the main bathroom where our shower is.\nHe was disgusting with this and didn\u2019t want to compromise like I tried doing. I even got a different trash can with a tight lid. (There was never any visible blood or smell) he didn\u2019t care.\nHe wanted me to use my private bathroom in my room. Because things like bleeding should be kept far away from him.\n\nI always changed a tampon before baths\/showers and the main bathroom was more convenient where it\u2019s located in the house. Why would I go through the trouble to go to my half bath in my room. It\u2019s my house? He doesn\u2019t pay rent. He\u2019s a guest.\n\nWell my boyfriend took his side. His friend got worse and worse and became verbally abusive to me while my boyfriend watched and let it happen. \nHe even tried to get him to kick me out of my own house.\nWell I told him it was either me or his friend but his friend couldn\u2019t stay with us anymore.\nMy boyfriend picked his friend and I ended the relationship. I told him that I\u2019m putting the house for sale or I can buy him out. He couldn\u2019t afford the house without me so yesterday I legally bought him out and I\u2019m done with this headache.

At first I was simply shocked- I asked him what he said, he repeated the question, and then I told him to never ask me that question again. I sat on the bus feeling my face and hands grow hot and sweaty. I can't describe the feeling, but it sucked.\n\nWell, I was in my art class last week when I walked across the room to ask my teacher a question. I had to bend down to pick something up that I had dropped, and the freshman and his friend happened to be sitting behind me (I'm a junior, but since this is an elective class, all grades can be mixed together). When I bent over I heard whispers, giggles, and dirty remarks coming from behind me. I immediately turned around and shot the boys a dirty look. Then, for the third time, he said... \"Hey, I know I already asked you this question, but can I PLEASE eat you out?\" At that moment my teacher turned around and asked me what my question was. As I talked to my teacher, I couldn't get those five words out of my head. I felt so angry and upset. I rehearsed my comeback in my head.\n\nWhen I finished talking to my teacher, I leaned over, got uncomfortably close to the kid's face, and I yelled in my LOUDEST and BRAVEST voice: \"What the fuck is wrong with you? You're rude, disrespectful, and disgusting. NEVER ask me that question again. I'll get you expelled for that shit.\" Immediately the whole class went completely silent, my teacher stared at me, and back to the freshman, and pulled me into the hallway to explain what happened. When I got into the hallway I broke down in tears, and my teacher sent me to the dean's office where I wrote a statement and received apologies and reassurance from administration. The freshman was suspended.\n\nThis might seem kind of silly, but for someone who is shy and doesn't typically stick up for themselves, I feel pretty triumphant!

Three years ago I had a baby girl, her name was Emily and I loved her more than anything in this entire fucked up world. She was a mistake and I'd only been getting my shit together when I found out I was going to have her. I spent a long time thinking over whether or not I should have her or just abort her because I wasn't bringing her into a good place, but in the end I planned things out and did everything to make sure I could afford her and we wouldn't be living in poverty. I did everything I could for my baby with doctors visits and medicine and working a shit retail job at 8 months pregnant all by myself just so I could bring some happiness into my life. she was born in October and was so so beautiful. I'd messed up a few things in my life but I wasn't going to mess up with her if I could help it.\n\n\nThen when she was 8 months old, too young yet for an mmr shot? she got sick. She was sick for a while and I'd never seen anything like it. I took her to the doctor. She was in the hospital and she looked so bad, she was crying and coughing and there was nothing I could do. I felt like the worst mother in the world. After I got her to the hospital she got worse, got something called measles encephalitis, where her brain was inflamed. I hadn't believed in god in years but you better believe I was praying for her every day.\n\nShe died in the hospital a week or so later. I held her little tiny body and wanted to jump off a bridge and broke down in the hospital. The nurses were sympathetic and I was, well I made a scene I'm pretty sure.\n\n\nI found out later via facebook of fucking course that the neighbor I'd had watch my baby was an anti-vaxxer and had posted photos of her kid sick and other bullshit about how he was fine.\n\nHe was fine? He was FINE? My kid was DEAD because she made that choice. I went over and talked to her and she admitted he'd been sick when she'd had my kid last but didn't think much of it. I screamed at her. I screamed and yelled and told her the devil was going to torture her soul for eternity you god loving cunt because she took my baby from me. I'm sure I looked crazy, at the time maybe I was. I'm crying writing this now, and in my darkest moments I'd wished her kid was dead and it makes me feel worse.\n\n\nI'd like to say I'm doing better but I'm really not. I'm alive, going day to day, trying to be the person I wanted to be for my kid even if my little Emily isn't here anymore. That's the only thing keeping me going anymore. I don't have anything else left.\n\nPlease vaccinate your kids, so other moms like me don't have to watch their baby die. It's not just your choice only affecting your kid, you are putting every child who for some reason hasn't gotten vaccinated in SO much danger. Please please please for the love of god please vaccinate.\n\n**EDIT: I spent a long time thinking about if I should edit this, after being horrified that I posted this in the first place and puking and crying. I still can't deal with any of this when not drunk. Thank you to everyone for the support, saying that doesn't really cover how I feel, I'm just glad there are good people out there, and I'm sorry to all of you who have suffered a loss. To everyone who told me I was a murderer, that it was my fault, that I was an awful mother, that my child spending time with a boy who had measles was NOT the reason my baby got measles, that I never should have had a kid because I was poor, and that I should kill myself, I have only one thing to say to you, because anything else isn't worth it: I hope you are happy. I hope you live a long and happy life with people in it who love you and care for you and that you do not suffer like I did. I hope you are loved.**","title":"Please please please god vaccinate your kids","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/5na3ry\/please_please_please_god_vaccinate_your_kids\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false}

I had to use the bathroom before our drive home, so I popped into a mall that was desolate even before Covid times, because I knew the bathroom was right in the entrance, down a hallway to the other side of the mall, but still visible from the front doors. Quick and easy. \n\nAs I walked in, I passed a man in a yellow mask, leaning on the opposite side of a pillar in front of the entrance. I felt him turn towards me as I passed, but I carried on my way. \n\nI can\u2019t explain why, but a post I had read on here suddenly popped into my head, about a woman who had avoided a man following her. The top comment I had read at the time said to never go into a public bathroom if followed. \n\nI passed the hallway into the main shopping center, and saw a dollhouse store to my left. I remembered another comment saying that if you aren\u2019t sure whether or not you are being followed, to go into a store that the suspected person would not typically have interest in. Instinct took over, and I turned toward it.\n\nThere was no one at the counter, so I chose a section of miniatures to admire, all the while eyeing the man in the yellow mask. He casually made his way into the store, and came to a stop at the same section, a few feet from me, but looking in my direction. \n\nAs the realization sunk in, I fought back paralyzingly fear, and reached for my phone in my pocket. I turned abruptly, and quickly walked back toward the exit as the phone ran for my husband, who was waiting out in the car for me. \n\nThe man in the yellow mask turned and matched my pace toward the exit.\n\nI can\u2019t explain the mixed feeling of fear, knowing the man was almost grabbing distance behind me now, and relief, when the call connected, and I heard my safe person on the other end of the line. \n\nWith the phone on speaker, I loudly said, \u201cI am being followed by the man behind me,\u201d and without missing a beat, my husband was out of the car and assured me he was coming. \n\nI can\u2019t find the post, or remember the usernames of the people who\u2019s advice I followed, but thank you.

I also have a deep voice for a woman. I LOVE looking androgynous and don\u2019t feel bad about it. I also have a gender neutral name. \n\nIn the past year, people have begun mistaking me for a trans woman. \n\n\u2014 I went to a doctor\u2019s appointment. The doctor (female) asked me my pronouns. I said, \u201cShe\/her.\u201d The doctor began referring to me exclusively as male. She gave me some bad news and I began crying and hugging my husband (who was attending the appointment with me). She became extra shitty and asked me to stop and hurry up so she could get on with the appointment. I assumed that the doctor was just an asshole\u2026 I later found out she marked on my intake forms that I was MTF (male to female transgender). At the time, I had no idea what was going on, but afterwards, I realized she was trying to misgender by referring to me as male and was being shitty because she was transphobic. \n\n\u2014 I had to stay overnight in the hospital. I told them I was a woman. They tried to put me in a room with a dangerous male psych patient. I explained that, per hospital policy, I shouldn\u2019t be housed with a male roommate. They insisted I \u201chad to be\u201d because I was \u201ctechnically biologically male.\u201d I explained, no, I was born a woman. This is so fucked up to me\u2014 what if I was a trans woman? Why the fuck would they be putting a female-presenting trans woman in a room with a dangerous male psych patient? \n\n\u2014 I have been called a faggot. \n\n\u2014 A male patient at the nursing home commented on how he could see my erection through my pants.

In hopes that it would be okay I be allowed to post. And when I thought of safe, this subreddit was the first to come to mind.\n\n\u2014\n\nMy dad died less than 12 hours ago from COVID.\n\nHe started feeling poorly on Monday. He got ill, began stumbling, on Thursday. I had my mom call an ambulance and he was diagnosed that night. Less than 24 hours later, they called a code blue and he died. He had COPD, heart issues (previous quad bypass), and was 80 years old. \n\nAs soon as he tested positive, I knew the odds were that he wasn\u2019t going to make it. You know the odds when you work in a hospital. \n\nI work at a hospital (team lead for breast and gynecological oncology department). I have patients pass away due to cancer all the time. COVID has been there too. Surgeries cancelled. Chemo delayed due to exposure. Patients who die from it. My dad just died from it. My dad died. My dad..\n\nWhenever I get a phone call from a patient\u2019s family member, letting us know that a patient has died, I stuff that set of emotions in a box. I have to be strong for them and listen to them as their voice breaks. I have to comfort them. And when we find out from the grapevine that a patient passed, I put those feelings in that box too. The box feels full when a patient passes that you\u2019re close with. That maybe you saw their progression and spent time with them.. and then they are gone. That box gets really full.\n\nI don\u2019t have many friends. I don\u2019t have anyone outside of my spouse (and mother) to talk to. I posted on Facebook in effort to find someone to talk to, but my brother (half, older) got upset and told me to take it down. That his kids were out and driving around and he didn\u2019t want them to see it before he got to talk to them. I posted it to my Twitter (private) but he saw it and called, cussing, telling me to take it down. I took it down.\n\nSo I\u2019m here. I only meant to write two or three sentences but the words started tumbling out. I\u2019m sorry for whoever sat through and read all of this. I didn\u2019t mean to make it so long. I just. I can\u2019t sleep and my dad died and I\u2019m so tired of COVID. I\u2019m so, so sick and tired of COVID. I love my job but the work has been exhausting and taxing since March. I love my hospital but it\u2019s been so, so tiring to be in that building every shift.\n\nMy dad died and I feel alone and I just hope it is okay I post this here.\n\nThank you for your time. This subreddit is amazing and I love reading how supportive everyone is. It gives me faith and hope. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n_Note_ - Thank you everyone who had helped my mom earlier. She was sobbing on the phone. Total strangers she said. I did not know that fundraising was not allowed here. I am so sorry. I deleted my moms GoFundMe link but if you can still help, please - it is on their main website under reddit covid and I made a post on the assistance subreddit with a link like the mod suggested. And again, I\u2019m sorry for breaking the rules. \n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nEdit, 8:43AM, EST: I\u2019m still here and.. want to be here. I\u2019m so glad that out of the subreddits that I was trying to figure out to post to - this was the one. My brother asked me to at least wait 24 hours to post anything on social media. We are in isolation\/quarantine, so I\u2019m staying between my spouse, toddler, my close family by text, and on here. Internet strangers who are so much more than that. I know I cannot reply to every single person - but I am reading everything posted and its making the heavy weight on my chest a little less heavy. Thank you all - so, so much.\n\nEdit, 12:52PM, EST: I am at a loss for words with all these comments of kindness. My spouse and me just did our COVID test. I am going to try and sleep for an hour or two. I have tunnel vision and my ears are ringing. I think I may be in shock again. Or something similar. Everyone here is amazing. I just. **I love you all.**\n\n**Edit, 4:07PM, EST:** Again, I am sorry that I posted the GoFundMe link. I didn\u2019t know I was breaking the rules. If anyone knows where I can fundraise to help my mom, please send me a message. I\u2019ll do anything for her. I did post on r\/assistance like the mod suggested (the post is probably easiest found under my user page). I just know if I post to Twitter or Facebook, it would upset my brother. If he even knew I was doing a fundraiser, he would be upset. And.. thank you beyond words to everyone whose been here for me today. Been there for my mom today. For everything. I am still trying to reply here and there. This whole day has been so many emotions. I love you guys so, so much.","title":"My dad died of COVID. I work at a hospital. I have very few friends.

However, I had a great dad who was always willing to bring me to these things, so I never felt like I missed out on those things. He'd often drop me off and then pick me up or something. \n\nWhen I was 16, right around prom time, I decided that I wanted to wax my legs. I mean, I obviously didn't want to have missed spots and I wanted my legs to be smooth and whatnot. My dad was very hesitant. He first said no, not yet, but as prom was approaching I became more and more insistent and he just said fine, that he'd do some research and book an appointment. \n\nAs usually, he held his word and a few days later, I had an appointment with the sweetest waxer I'll probably ever meet. My dad has ONE condition: no upper legs. We convinced him to do a couple inches from my knees, because... Dresses and skirts, but not more than that. \n\nSo that was a little over a decade ago. I continues going to her for a while and then I moved. Summer is here and I booked an appointment with her this morning. After all the catch up we did (a good 5 years!) she said she had to tell me something. \n\nShe told me that before my first appointment, my dad had called her and booked an appointment for himself. He spoke to her about her techniques and whatnot. He requested a full leg shave and she was happy to oblige. After he was done, he told her that he really didn't enjoy any of it but that his 16 year old daughter wanted to her her legs waxed and that he wanted to try it first. He booked an appointment for me that very same day. However, the waxer says that he called the very next day saying he had bruising on his upper legs and that it hurt. The waxer said it was possible and somewhat common, so he vetoed the upper leg for me.\n\nO.M.G. The thing is, this is exactly like my dad. It's something he would do and it's something he'd probably never ever tell me he did. It was just another reminder of how thoughtful he is and always was. \n\n","title":"That time my dad prohibited me to get my upper leg waxed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/6i6thz\/that_time_my_dad_prohibited_me_to_get_my_upper\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

As I understand it, this is an informational meeting where students interested in the service academies can meet with Matt Gaetz. I understand that in order to apply for service academies, students need a nomination from their representative, senator, or the vice president. The students NEED his endorsement, and there is nothing that your office can do about that, which again, I fully understand. \n\nMatt Gaetz is under federal investigation for having sex with a 17 year old girl (the news keeps calling this sex with a minor. In Florida, the age of consent is 18, so this isn't just \"sex with a minor\". That's rape.) and paying for her to travel across state lines, violating sex-trafficking laws.\n\nIt is absolutely vile that the school system would invite someone currently under investigation for rape and sex-trafficking into the school to speak to 17 year old girls and put them in a position where they have to ask him for a favor. This investigation has been ongoing for a long time, so the county has had plenty of time to come up with an alternative to allowing him to speak at the school. Any information he needs to give out can easily be done via email, or even a Zoom call with interested students and their parents. \n\nIt seems to me that the school system should not allow someone under investigation for sex with minors anywhere near a school, if for no other reason than out of an abundance of caution. Instead, however, you are quite literally giving him access to potential new victims, and directing them to ask him for something. I would think that the safety of students would be a top priority for Okaloosa County, but this decision leads me to believe otherwise. If a teacher is under federal investigation for sex with a student, does that teacher stay in the classroom teaching while the investigation is ongoing? I\u2019m fairly certain I know the answer. \n\nThank you for taking these concerns into consideration.","title":"Matt Gaetz will be speaking at a high school near me next week.

It means so much to hear so much reassurance and hope. Thank you also to everyone who shared their own story with me. \n\nMy daughter is doing well. The staff is optimistic and they all really like her, and she's even smiled and laughed a few times during our visits. I heeded some advice and brought her fuzzy socks and slippers, comfy clothes, her favorite blanket, some stuffed animals she still has, her own toiletries... a lot. She's on board to start therapy asap after discharge so I got her preferences (she wants a woman, understandably) and I'm on the hunt.\n\nI'm setting up therapy for myself as well. Apart from feeling overwhelmed out of my mind, I've also been going through some addiction problems - nothing illegal or life threatening, but I'm done with that shit.))\n\nI am a single father. I just got home from the hospital and I feel so defeated and like everything has crashed and burned today. \n\nLong story short, this morning I walked in on my daughter sitting on the floor of her bedroom, about to hang herself. We have a great relationship and I even have permission to enter her room if she didn't answer my knocking for a minute because she's always using noise canceling headphones. \n\nI went to ask her where our dog's harness was, and upon opening the door I just saw her sobbing violently but silently, and looking at the noose hanging in her closet. I knew exactly what it was and I ran to her and yanked it out of her hand.\n\nI told her we had to go to the ER and she began yelling at me. So I ended up calling 911 because I could not physically force her to go on my own.\n\nIn the ER, at first she was angry and would not allow me to stay in her room, but she did get calmer and actually asked me to stay because she was scared. We talked to nurses, doctors, and social workers; they were able to get through to her and she admitted how suicidal she was and confided in them that she had been raped by a friend's relative a month prior. \n\nSo they decided to admit her, and that's where we are now. I'm going to visit her every day with her favorite snacks and books. She will be discharged home in (predicted) 7-10 days and I'm looking into getting her a therapist or even a higher level of care if needed. I'm researching trauma and suicide so I can better understand this whole thing. But I'm still so lost and i failed her because I didn't fucking notice what was going on. What else do I do?\n\n\n","title":"My daughter just got admitted to a psych unit for trying to kill herself after she was raped and I can't hold it together","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/7q9eu0\/my_daughter_just_got_admitted_to_a_psych_unit_for\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false}

We have 3 kids together and I\u2019m 35 years old, my husband is 40. We discussed it several times and we agreed no more babies and I wanted to get my tubes tied. HOO BOY let me tell you, that was a process. \n\nSo first I had to talk to my gynecologist obviously, and she spent 30 minutes trying to talk me out of it, saying I might change my mind. After I persisted and convinced her that I indeed was done having kids, she referred me to another gynecologist. That dr again spent the entire appt trying to convince me I would regret it. I said no, I absolutely want to get my tubes tied, 100% will not regret it. THEN I had to talk to the therapist about it, who I again had to convince I was absolutely certain this is what I wanted. THEN we had to have a consult with my husband who had to SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP in order for me to get it done. Whatever, I sorta understand that since we\u2019re in this together and all, blah blah blah. Anyways, it took maybe a month of doctor appointments and convincing everyone of what I wanted to do with my own body and.... the insurance put a screeching halt to everything. Apparently they don\u2019t cover getting a tubal unless it\u2019s an emergency. Ugh\n\nSo onto plan B, husband gets a vasectomy instead. HOO BOY let me tell you, it was the easiest fucking thing to get done. WTF?! He makes an appointment with a urologist. Says \u201chey we\u2019re done having kids, I want a vasectomy\u201d, the doctor says \u201cok great, let\u2019s schedule it for next week\u201d. Again, WTF?! No second or third appointment with several doctors trying to tell him he\u2019s going to regret it? No therapy session? NO PERMISSION SLIP?! And oh by the way, it was fully covered by our insurance. I\u2019m so beyond annoyed and frustrated with how women are treated by some medical professionals when it comes to our own bodies. I know it\u2019s not like this everywhere, but here in the Midwest or the south, I feel like women are looked at like baby making factories, and when we decide we don\u2019t want to be, we are going to regret it. I\u2019m tired of it.\n\nEdit: so a lot of you are asking why a tubal was my first choice and vasectomy was second. I was going to be having surgery for endometriosis already, and since I was going to be opened up anyways, I thought getting my tubes tied at the same time would be simple, but I was wrong. I guess that was kind of a big detail to have left out, sorry. A lot were also asking where this took place. I live in northwest Arkansas, but my doctor and the hospital where this took place is in southwest Missouri.","title":"My husband had to give permission in order for me to get my tubes tied, but I don\u2019t have to give permission for his vasectomy?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/i127gf\/my_husband_had_to_give_permission_in_order_for_me\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

Thankfully, how I reacted was \"consistent\" with how a rape victim acts after an attack, there was physical and circumstantial evidence, and the San Diego DA believed me, and decided to prosecute. Out of all rape cases only 4% even are brought to a jury for trial. It's sad how rare these things end with a good outcome, and even sadder how few victims are believed. I have to express my gratitude for the responding officers in this case for not treating the perpetrator like a \"brother officer\" in the words of the judge, but like a suspected rapist. I know had this incident occurred in the rapist's hometown of Yuma AZ, the incident would have been handled differently and the outcome much different. Nevertheless I am lucky. I survived. I just want the world to know when he does get out, if he does get out, his name is JARED ELKINS, he is NOT a police officer, like he told another woman that he raped while out on bail, and he is a dangerous SEX OFFENDER. Also, please don't think about how you act after an attack. Just report it. As I have discovered, you could possibly be saving many other lives in the future from a similar fate, and whatever scrutiny is worth it. ","title":"Cop who Raped Me Gets 20 YEARS in Prison.

I was hyperventilating and so anxious that my muscles were locking up. I really didn't like hospitals, and I certainly didn't like the fact that something was clearly wrong enough for me to be there. I was only 29.\n\nThe ER doctor on rotation that night set me up with IV painkillers and had me sent off for scans. The meds helped calm me down, and numbed everything enough that I could stop crying. But when he returned to my bedside, he brought a surgeon with him. They explained the scans looked normal, and my blood work was fine. \n\nAnd yet, I was clearly NOT fine. I was in a lot of pain. So they told me they wanted to do exploratory surgery with the intent of removing my ovary, gallbladder, or appendix, most likely. \n\nI said ok. \n\nWhen I awoke from surgery, I was told my appendix had been removed due to some discoloration, but everything else looked healthy. I was to report to the surgeon's office in 10 days for follow up to check on my incisions.\n\nMy surgeon stared at my paperwork at the follow up, head in his hands. I thought maybe it was just a long day, unrelated to me. \n\n\"The ER doctor saved your life.\"\n\nTurns out I had carcinoid cancer in my apprendix. Its usually pretty asymptomatic, hard to spot, and typically found after it has metastasized all over the place.  \n\nOn paper, I should have been sent home with nausea meds and maybe light pain meds and told to see a GI (which would have taken months for an appointment). Statistically, I should have been told to suck it up and it was just a belly ache. But they both believed me. They believed I was in so much pain that the standard diagnostic tools were clearly missing what was actually wrong with me. \n\nThere are so many stories of women's pain being ignored or downplayed. I could have easily been discharged and been one of those women. Who knows how long I would have gone with cancer. \n\nBut they believed me. Both of them. \n\nThey saved my life. And I still think about those two men frequently... how they believed me, a 29 year old woman, about my pain, and took a risk to help me. \n\nI've been cancer-free for 6 years so far, and get checked every 3 months because this cancer type can pop up randomly. But for now... I'm genuinely thankful those 2 actually believed me. \n\nThe world needs more doctors like them.","title":"I went to the ER in horrific pain 6 years ago","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/i3v3qo\/i_went_to_the_er_in_horrific_pain_6_years_ago\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

It's a nice place and we employ people who are expected to act professionally. We have low turnover so we don't hire new people that often. But last week I hired a new waitress because we need the coverage. She's a very pretty woman in her mid-20s. She brought some experience and some excellent recommendations and so far she's been a stellar employee. My problem is with the men who work for me.\n\nHoly shit you guys. I've done my best to cultivate a workplace that is fair and kind and ethical. But some of these dudes have turned into fucking jackasses. It's even worse because I've known some of them for years and they've never behaved this way in front of me before. I thought they were good guys, but all it takes is 10 days with an attractive young woman and they become slobbering pigs.\n\nTonight I had to fire one of my line cooks. This is a guy in his 40s who has worked for me for years. He worked with my husband before we owned our own place. I'm friends with his wife. And yet he decided that what he needed to do was ask this new waitress out... repeatedly. He cornered her in the walk-in and wouldn't let her leave until she said yes. He's a fucking idiot because he knows I have a camera in there, but here we are. He's fired in the middle of the dinner rush and everyone else had to pick up his slack. Now he's blowing up my husband's phone trying to get un-fired. Fat chance, buddy. My husband doesn't suck.\n\nI'm hoping that one high-profile firing will chill the other dudes out. Because I've seen several of them act like idiots around her. Dudes who I know are married or have girlfriends. We have a Christmas and a summer solstice party for the staff every year so I've met a lot of wives and girlfriends. It's like they don't think I see, or they don't think I remember, or they don't care.\n\nI don't know. I'm just so tired. And I'm down a line cook for tomorrow. And everyone is mad, or sad, or freaked out. I'm sitting here drinking a beer because my husband is gonna walk in soon and we're gonna have to talk about it. And I married a good man, but I know I'm gonna have to explain that the firings are gonna continue until the harassment stops. \n\nI'm just so tired.

So please, I don't need to hear it was a dumb thing to do, because I know it was..\n\nTo give a little background. I only dated this guy for a few months, and I unfortunately sent him a few pictures that I'm now not proud of sending. We broke up around March of last year and that was it ( or so I thought ). \n\nWell a week ago this joker messages me. He starts off just wanting to know how I'm doing. I tell him I'm doing well and all. As we are chatting, he mentions that he still has my nudes saved.\n\nHe then proceeds to tell me that he wants to have sex, and that if I don't want my nudes public I better listen to him or else. My heart is pounding out of my chest at this point. I come from a conservative family and they would be disappointed in me doing something like this. \n\nBut I also didn't want to be a slave or at the mercy of anyone. Especially this guy. I took a minute to think all of this over. I initially asked him to delete them. I kept asking him over and over and he would refuse. \n\nThen I decided I wasn't going to let this guy scare me or try to control. And if he did expose my nudes, I would just give my family a heads up. They might have been disappointed, but he was better than being controlled by him.\n\nSo I told him to do as he pleased. Then I told him how I have screen shots this whole chat, and that if I see even one picture of mine online I was going to contact the police. I told him he would be guilty of two crimes. One being he tried to blackmail me and the second would be revenge porn ( which is illegal in my state).\n\nI also told him I would send our chat to his family and Co workers so they would know what kind of a creep he is. \n\nAfter I sent this, it was silence from him for a good 20 minutes from him. He messages me back and says I'm overacting, and that he wasn't trying blackmail me. He then says he deleted my nudes, so it was no need for me to get all up and arms and go to the police or expose our chat. \n\nI decided to not message him back, so he could sweat and freak out like he scared me. He started messaging me like crazy begging me not to go to the police.\n\nI finally messaged him back and told him, I wouldn't go to the cops for now. But if he ever pulled anything like this on me again, I am going to the cops. \n\nI was proud of myself. That I had the courage to not give in to him. I've been a generally weak leoesn my whole life. I scare easily. \n\nBut I don't know where the strength came from to stand up to this creep. The thought of having my nudes leaked would horrify me. But in that moment I was willing to risk that instead of being blackmailed into doing things fir this creep.\n\n***EDIT: The reason why I didn't go the police anyway, because I feel as though this situation is resolved. He was legitimately scared of being exposed by the cops and his family\/friends.\n\nIf he ever pulls something like this again, I will definitely being contacting the cops without hesitation.\n\nI just want this whole orderal  behind me. And as I've mentioned before, I come from a very religious conservative family. Filing charges and possible criminal case would mean my family would find out that I've sent nudes to someone. They don't even know I date, much less sent nudes to someone.\n\nObviously had he exposed my pictures, I would have told my family, to save myself from being blackmailed. But if I can keep this from my family, the better***","title":"An ex tried to blackmail with my nudes.

There were no prerequisites to attend, I had experience with programming and computational modeling, and I wanted to learn the fundamentals of machine learning before I started grad school.  It was not a graded class; just a mini-retreat held on campus one Saturday.\n\nOut of the approximately 100-150 attendees, maybe four (including me) were female.  I was the only one wearing a dress and makeup.  The professor who facilitated the seminar began by asking questions to assess the general knowledge level in the room.  When he noticed I wasn't raising my hand, as I was brand new to the material, he began pointedly looking at me each time he asked a question.  Then he switched his question style: \"raise your hand if you *haven't* heard of...\"\n\nHe made eye contact with me and smirked at me every single time I didn't know the answer.  Other men--not all, not even a majority, but enough to notice a pattern--in the audience began to catch on and follow his gaze.  They then began laughing at me.  I literally did not believe they were pointedly laughing at my expense until my ex said to me, horrified, \"They're laughing at you.\"\n\nTwo years later, I'm ~~getting~~ working on my Ph.D. (sorry for the unintentional confusion--I'm nearly halfway through my program, but I still have a ways to go before I get my degree!), and my research uses deep learning, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling.  Last month, I was invited to give an alumni talk at my undergrad about my research.\n\nToday, I emailed that professor, and I invited him to attend my talk.  I told him that his machine learning seminar was one of the reasons I pursued a career in computational neuroscience.  I included a few details about the machine learning techniques I use and the research I am conducting.  I don't know if he will remember me, and frankly, I don't care.\n\nYou can laugh at me all you want.  You can try to play gatekeeper.  But you will *not* get between me and my seat at the table.\n\nI'm sure you can guess who's laughing now.","title":"I sent an email to the professor who laughed me out of a machine learning seminar two years ago","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/i995or\/i_sent_an_email_to_the_professor_who_laughed_me\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

She\u2019s been slowly working on getting everything ready to leave him - things like getting her important documents away to trusted people, finding a new place to stay, saving up enough money etc. but it\u2019s been hard because he\u2019s really controlling and he\u2019ll go through all her stuff. \n\nBut then she found out she was pregnant. There was no happiness at the news on her part. He has always desperately wanted kids with her. She never wanted kids with him. She doesn\u2019t even want pets with him. \n\nI\u2019m forever grateful that it\u2019s relatively easy to get an abortion where we live, and I\u2019m forever grateful for her doctor. \n\nHer doctor was amazing.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the protocol here for doctors to get their pregnant patients alone and ask them about anything concerning - like abuse. It was then that Jane told her doctor about her situation and begged for an abortion. She asked her doctor to give her one secretly and lie to her partner. There was no judgement from her doctor at all. Her doctor believed her and immediately took her side. \n\nJane managed to get the abortion secretly. Her doctor lied to her partner about everything the entire time. Said that Jane just needed to get some more tests done and that they were busy and it\u2019ll take a while when Jane was really going to get her abortion done. She opted for the surgical abortion so it was really quick. \n\nAfterwards her doctor lied again to her partner and said that she thought Jane had already left - didn\u2019t she leave with you? When in reality Jane was leaving with me from a different building in a different exit. \n\nJane\u2019s doctor is the reason she managed to solve her problems instead of ending up with even bigger ones. It was just so refreshing for her doctor to believe her immediately like that. No argument. No doubt. Just completely took her at her word and went above and beyond. I know if I told the people I know in real life they\u2019d think the doctor was in the wrong for keeping it away from the man in the relationship, but I feel like people here will understand.

It's not fair to push the problem of systemic poverty and population control solely onto women by pushing them to take the pill and get IUDs. Plus we are constantly told that IUD's and birth control pills are super easy and painless and have no side effects-- and this is a lie. We need honestly from our doctors. Many women have some kind of side effect to birth control pills and this information is still skewed and dishonest. It's so hard to find research regarding mental health and birth control pills. Some studies suggest birth control is strongly correlated to depression, but even with this information, people never want to acknowledge it. They just want to keep women in charge of birth control and not support men's right to birth control. Hey, why aren't there MRA's out there fighting for more male birth control options? hmmm.. I wonder...\n\nAlso- IUD's aren't just like, wha bam, super easy breezy. Some women say they barely felt it, but many women say that insertion was extremely painful, some say even the most painful thing they've ever experienced.\n\nI'm tried of the burden of birth control being forced only on women. We need to share this burden with men. Women tend to keep their struggles and pain regarding their female body parts, including trans women who get monthly cramps and PMS type symptoms from hormones. So when we get all these side effects we usually keep it to ourselves and collectively so. We are told our complaints are nothing. We tell our doctors and they shrug in our faces.\n\nYou can read here of women complaining about IUD insertion. What's even more sad is we are told pain is so rare and unusual, so they don't even regularly give the pill suppository to soften the cervix the day before, to make insertion easier. They should obviously give it to everyone: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/endometriosis\/comments\/kf4ejh\/is\\_mirena\\_iud\\_removal\\_as\\_painful\\_as\\_insertion\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/endometriosis\/comments\/kf4ejh\/is_mirena_iud_removal_as_painful_as_insertion\/)","title":"We need to quit acting like IUD's and birth control pills are super easy and no big deal.

Rather than emphasize with his mom he views it as if Roe v. Wade had been around then he wouldn't be here.  \n\nI got sick of him pushing his opinion so I told him a truth that I always felt that he wasn't strong enough to hear.  When I was 14 I started dating an older boy (17).  I was hesitant on having sex and told him no many many times and eventually it because a \"If I mattered to you, you would do it\" situation.  I caved.\n\nSo the first time I had sex it was coerced, technically statutory rape, I didn't like it, and the condom broke.  \n\nMy dad asked how I could never tell him and my mother.  I told him because he made it resoundingly clear that if I was pregnant that my life was over. Him and my brother spoke about women calling them slurs.  My brother had said he would disown me for being a slut.  My father said I would be expected to drop out of school and work.  These were things they had told me inplace of any sexual education.  I heard these things before I was 14.\n\nI then told my father how my then ex told me that I should lie to my family if I was pregnant and say I had been raped by a stranger so he would be consequence free.  That my ex said he didn't want to be seen with me after the condom broke because it would raise suspicion.  I told my dad how he and my ex put me in a position where I felt I had no one so I planned to kill myself if I missed my period.  I planned to take my mother's opiates and sedatives and I was going to drown myself in a pond in the woods. \n\nAnd they only thing that kept me alive was not being pregnant.  I got my period.  But living with the belief that pregnancy was not a choice nearly killed me and that I didn't want to die, I just didn'twant to quit school because I knew I would be stuck in poverty like my parents.  His daughter was almost dead.\n\nMy dad looked shocked and said that he wished I would have told them.   And he just kind of sat silent for a while.  I just hope that it has some kind of lasting impact on him.  That maybe he will quit thinking of potential babies as more important that walking talking women and girls.","title":"14 years later I told my father how his pro-life beliefs almost killed me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/r772by\/14_years_later_i_told_my_father_how_his_prolife\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

My daughter is 11 and has never known life without Uncle \"A\". My sister and him have always had a rocky relationship but over the last few years things had gotten better. They bought a gorgeous huge house, he adopted my nephew and they had a baby of their own. They make a decent amount of money and every vacation they've ever taken my daughter has gone with them. I used to joke about how my daughter was closer to A then to my sister. They had a very close bond and he'd buy her things and just spent a lot of time with her. I now know this was grooming. About 3 years ago we moved 5 hours away from all our family. So for the last 3 years I've sent her back home to spend the summers with family. She'd always stay with my sister. \n\n\nAbout a month ago her school had an assembly about inappropriate touching and how to spot it. Her teacher said after one scenario my daughter started to have a panic attack. She pulled her aside and my daughter told her everything. Last Summer when my daughter was down helping my brother in law started to \"accidently\" touch her breasts. She said she thought they were accidents so didn't say anything. Then he just started to outright touch her. The mother fucker told her \"You cant say anything. You know how mad your mom would get at you.\" So she kept quiet. I have told this girl since I can remember that if she's ever in that scenario and told that that she will never ever get in trouble nor would I be mad. I've told her \"even if its grandpa, grandma or even your dad. You will never get in trouble. You can tell me anything.\" I dont want to go too far into detail of what else was done but thankfully (I guess) it was always over clothes and she wasn't raped. I know had she never spoken up it would have lead to that. The weekend before Halloween we went back home and I left her with him to watch the movie Halloween with my mom and sister. This was the last time he did it and it was more aggressive this time. I remember picking her up and she was just in a terrible mood. I remember thinking it was the usual preteen moody stuff. Its fucking eating me alive to know I handed her to him without so much as a single thought. \n\n\nWhen the school called me I held it together. I brought her home, we talked, we went out to eat and I set her up an appointment with a psychiatrist. When she went to bed I fucking fell apart into my fiance's arms. It took everything in me not to drive back home and kill him. I called my mom and told her I needed her home in the morning cuz I was going home to tell her something very serious. I didn't tell her cu, honestly I believe she would have gone to their house and beat his ass. I took my daughter to school and drove the 5 hours home. I told my mom and we went to my sisters. I took all the documentation CPS and the police gave me. She went into a bit of a shock. She called him with me there and when she told him he said \"Do I need to turn myself in?\" Right then is when it really hit how real this all was. My sister is the strongest person I know. She kicked him out immediately and is in the process of divorcing him. I talked with her a while and then drove the 5 hours back. \n\n\nI dont even really know why I'm posting this. This last month I've been a bit of a zombie. Last night we put up our Christmas tree and I had a break down. I watched my sweet innocent little girl hanging ornaments and I felt a rage I've never felt. I just want to ask him how could he. How could he look at her and see anything but the little girl he's known since she was born. The little girl he's watched learn to walk and talk. The little girl that loved him. I'm just a mess today. I'm in the bathroom having a fucking breakdown at work. I've never wanted anyone dead more than him but that's selfish of me. Then I cant help but think of my sister and my 8 month old niece. He ruined everyone's life. Will my niece know her dad? I'm scared my sister will lose her house. Above all I'm scared of the lasting effects this will have on my girl. Will she recover? Selfish fucking bastard.\n\n\n\nEdit; I just want to thank everyone for the kind and loving messages I received. I want to thank all survivors of abuse who messaged me to tell me of their perseverance. It was very nice to hear that this rough patch won't last forever for her. We spent a wonderful evening watching football and eating cheese fries. I really do appreciate everyone.

I saw a drunk guy puking over a railing and asked if there was anything I could do to help him. I\u2019ve done this many times before and usually go out of my way to make sure people are safe and at home.\n\nHe responded with \u201cYeah, you can help me get some.\u201d\n\nAt that point I said never mind and walked away, but he followed me. I told him in no uncertain terms that he was to stay the fuck away from me. I walked away again.\n\nHe followed. He put his arm around my waist. I told him, calmly as I could, to stop. I kept walking, and this time he tried to grab me around my waist. I started running. He chased me. He caught up to me and he pushed me to the ground. He was pinning me down, and I started just screaming in his face, \u201cHELP ME!\u201d as loud as I fucking could.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect anyone to respond. I just wanted to be so loud and annoying that he gave up. In my mind it was my best chance.\n\nBut people did respond. Many people. They came out of their houses at 2:00am on a Monday morning to make sure I was ok. They held him in there, on their phones calling the police, while I ran home to safety.\n\nI should have stayed and made a statement. I should have ignored the dude in the first place. I should have done so many things.\n\nBut you stepped up tonight, Chicago. Thank you.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your words of support. For those of you that don\u2019t believe me, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need to justify myself to anonymous internet strangers. I wish I could answer all the questions, but the real reason for my post was because of the response I got from my fellow chicagoans, not for the situation itself. The absolute rush of relief hearing someone yell out their third floor window that they hear me and they\u2019re coming down to help...I can\u2019t even describe it.\n\nI don\u2019t regret helping him. Yes, it was terrifying, but I probably won\u2019t fully internalize it for a while yet. It all just seemed super unreal. It made it click why all stories of rape and attempted rape sound so contrived; because the men who would do something like this are all feeding off the same sick urges and act the same way. But I\u2019ll continue to do the dumb thing and check on people. \n\nAs for me, a woman, stopping to help a stranger at 2am: most drunk people say they\u2019re fine, they\u2019re almost home, or that they already called a friend for help. But sometimes they\u2019re too drunk to walk or they\u2019re so lost I\u2019m afraid that without intervention they\u2019ll sleep in an alley. Sometimes they\u2019re too drunk to use their phones and I\u2019ll help them call a friend or an Uber. Most of the time they\u2019re completely unaware how absolutely shitfaced they are. And in Chicago the police don\u2019t respond in any urgent manner if it\u2019s a wellness check. If the drunk person or some other person isn\u2019t in immediate danger, they have better things to do. Personally, I\u2019m willing to possibly put myself in harm\u2019s way if it might mean saving someone else from harm. Odds say I was going to run into this situation eventually and I will be better prepared to handle it if it, god forbid, happens again.\n\nAs for self-defense, I\u2019m going to get some mace. I hate guns. If you want to really ramp up a situation, threaten a drunk person. If you want to just redline it, pull a gun. Plus, since I\u2019m a cocktailer, it\u2019s illegal for me to have it at work, and it\u2019s illegal for me to have it on the train home.\n\nAs for the statement, I called my friend who is a south side Chicago cop and he walked me through making a statement, what good it will do, what to expect, and what information to focus on. I\u2019ve spent the day thinking about everything that happened so I can give the most important details. He said that since other people have likely already made a statement and I didn\u2019t stay on the scene, one more day isn\u2019t going to make a difference. I\u2019m going to make a statement in the morning.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve calmed down, I\u2019m just mostly angry.  Anger helps motivate me to learn how to navigate a situation better, so I\u2019m gunna let it ride  and eventually maybe it\u2019ll guide me to a therapist. But we will have to see. Thank you again everyone. You really helped me get over a lot of the initial guilt.","title":"A guy tried to rape me tonight","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/baqrve\/a_guy_tried_to_rape_me_tonight\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

It was very validating, and for many many months everything went swimmingly.   \n  \nEnter the creep. At first he just awarded one of my posts and graciously accepted my thanks. For many, many months I did not hear anything from him. Now, he has become convinced that I am his ex, regardless of any logical argument I try to make (does she also have the same surgery scars as I have? A prominent mole in the same place? Is she the same age as me? [I looked her up and I doubt it; I think I'm way older than she is]). He wouldn't be convinced and told me my posts are breaking up marriages (I sincerely hope this isn't true and I've heard nothing from angry or bereft spouses, so I just truly don't know) and if I didn't stop posting he would come to my home and stab me.  \n  \nI reported this message using Reddit's report system. Two breathless days later I received a canned response stating that they have reviewed his messages and they \"don't violate Reddit's content policy.\" Not only that, but reddit has seemingly removed all way to contact an actual human who runs this site. It's just a giant list of topics now, none of which include the word violence.\n  \nWow. Two women threatened with fatal violence, one completely innocent of any of these things, but hey, it doesn't violate their content policy! C'mon Reddit, we can definitely do better! I was so incensed I nearly messaged their CISO (Allison Miller) on linkedin (which would have revealed my actual identity--rather scary in this situation).\n  \nIn conclusion, I know there are some people on here who will condemn me for my choices and I also know that the majority of you likely wouldn't choose this for yourselves. Regardless, we all deserve to feel safe in this space; we deserve the owners and operators of this site to take our safety seriously all the time, in every case.  \n  \n~~**Edit:** it's been brought to my attention that I missed some posts in \"the great scrub.\" I think I may have accidentally hidden them rather than delete them. Anyone know how to un-hide a post? Really sorry if you got an eyeful of something unsavory!~~\n\n**Edit 2:** Thank you all for the awards! If you're thinking of awarding this post, please consider donating to a women's shelter or organization that fights against domestic violence. Also, not sure why but I am getting a lot of notifications about comments that offer really lovely solidarity and some others that are outraged that I absolutely cannot see on this site. For those of you making light of this: it's a serious situation; please, take it seriously. And no, I'm not going to share my nudes any longer--a woman's life is at stake, ffs!\n\n**Edit 3:** (hopefully the final edit) Reddit has reached out and let me know that his message did in fact violate their content policy, but not what's being done about it. Hopefully he not only gets banned but this information is turned over to his local law enforcement.","title":"Posted my nudes anonymously and received a death threat from someone convinced I was his ex gf (I'm not).

I have lately been making serious attempts at trying to address some of my counterpart gender's concerns on the internet. Yesterday, I made the brave step: Complimenting my male co-worker. \n\nI was understandably nervous. What if he takes it the wrong way and thinks I'm demonstrating romantic interest (I am not interested). What if that mis-interpretation results in a change in our working environment? Is this a bad idea? Should I be more careful? Shit, what kind of compliment can I give that would be effective, but not come off as flirtatious? \n\nI took a deep breath, and as casually as I could, approached his desk and said \"Hey, are you losing weight? You look good!\" \\*insert casual smile\\* He definitely had lost weight, it was enough to be clear, but not so much that it was super obvious. \"What?\" He replied. Oh shit, thats right, he kind of has a hearing problem, and I probably half whispered it, not wanting everyone around us to hear. I took another deep breath, and through a gritty smile, repeated my statement more loudly than I was comfortable. He blinked a few times, processing. He then looked down at his desk, and said sadly \"its not being done voluntarily.\" He then opens up to me about how hard he has been struggling with depression, and how he has lost motivation at home to even eat anything. Through his pained expression, he admitted \"The only thing I tried to eat yesterday was a bowl of cheerios. I couldn't get through it. Then I was wide awake till almost 3 AM. Now, I cant tell if what I'm feeling is depression, or just sleep depravation and starvation.\" \n\nI just listened to him for a half hour as he talked about his therapy, his medication, and his struggles. I did my best to comfort and uplift, reminding him that I have always thought very highly of him as a co-worker and a person. \n\nToday, when I walked in-his raised his fist in the air in celebration at my arrival. I asked him how he was going. \"Better today. A lot better.

Wade fell last year, a trigger law from the year 1849 - over a decade before the start of the American Civil War that ended Chattel Slavery - banned abortion in the state. Despite a Democratic Governor ready to sign a repeal, the Republican controlled state legislature has opposed it, and a 4-3 conservative State Supreme Court slow walked the legal challenge. \n\nHowever, one of the 4 conservative justices, Patience D. Roggensack, is term limited, and the state elects SCOTUS judges by a vote so the race tomorrow will effectively determine control of the now deadlocked 3-3 court. A win for Judge Janet will give liberals a majority for the first time in 15 years, ensuring a liberal majority court will now have the final say on the legal challenge to the 1849 abortion ban, and in almost 100% likelihood, throw it in the trash.\n\nAND THAT'S NOT ALL \n\nWisconsin is victim to the worst Republican gerrymander in the country, where the maps are so rigged that Republicans only need 40% of the vote to control a majority of the state legislature, while Democrats need a 60% supermajority! Watchdogs have called it one of the most dangerous affronts to democracy in the Developed World. The conservative State Supreme Court has done nothing to address this, but a new liberal court majority is very likely to lead to a legal challenge against the maps. If overturned, Democrats would go to having a fair chance of winning a majority in the state legislature and turning the state fully blue like Michigan and Minnesota recently did. It would ensure that not only the monstrous 1849 abortion ban would be overturned, but Republicans would struggle to get back the legislature to ban it all over again. Right now all they need is the Governor's Mansion. \n\nJanet's opponent, Dan Kelly, is a hardline conservative backed by the three biggest anti-abortion groups in the state. He was part of a scheme to throw out Joe Biden's victory in Wisconsin in 2020 by sending an alternative slate of electors to vote for Donald Trump instead. He is a mad man, and is very likely to uphold the 1849 ban as well as the maps.\n\nLadies, however you can, GET OUT AND VOTE FOR JANET!!!","title":"WOMEN OF WISCONSIN: Get ready to vote tomorrow in one of the biggest elections in modern U.S. history that no one's ever heard of.

I included a link the first post, and let them know that it had gotten almost 3 million views, and the overwhelming majority of the comments agreed with me. I suggested that they take a look at some of your comments and realize that this is a serious issue. Then I asked what the county\u2019s protocol is if a teacher is under investigation for having sex with a student \u2013 is that teacher allowed to remain in the classroom? I also asked at what point does the school\/county become liable if Gaetz meets his next \u201cgirlfriend\u201d at an event like this, and the county did nothing to prevent it? I mentioned that I had not heard from anyone, but that I was aware that Mr. Chambers (the superintendent) had been responding to others, and that the gist of his response seems to be shrugging the whole thing off. I ended with \u201cI don't have a child in the school system, but I am a taxpayer and a voter. I've been in contact with a reporter from Newsweek, and I have no intention of dropping this.\u201d \n\nA few hours later, I got a call from the superintendent. I\u2019m not gonna lie, this is so far out of my wheelhouse. I was so nervous. I knew I would be posting an update, so I wanted to record the conversation just to make sure I accurately quoted him. I asked if I could record the call, and he said he\u2019d rather not, that he just wanted to have a conversation. I assume it was for the same reason that he\u2019s responding to emails with phone calls in the first place \u2013 to not have a record of what he has said. He gave me the same spiel he\u2019s giving everybody else. It\u2019s not his event, he\u2019ll be there, most of the parents will be in attendance, blah blah blah. I let him know that it\u2019s at a school, so ultimately it IS his event. He did agree with that. He started by saying that it\u2019s an investigation and there were no charges or arrests. I asked if they would wait for charges to be filed and an arrest to be made if it were a teacher. Would that teacher still be in the classroom? He said no, they would be put on administrative leave. I asked what the difference was and he paused and said \u201cyou would win that argument\u201d but didn\u2019t go any further. I wish I would have pushed him more on that.\n\nHe did try to tell me that that he wasn't going to be pushing a political agenda. I shut that down and said that that was not the issue. The issue is putting teenagers in front of a known predator.\n\nI asked about what the school\u2019s liability would be if it turned out Gaetz was guilty and he had been using these events to meet high school girls. He said he didn\u2019t think that would happen, which leads me to believe he doesn\u2019t believe the allegations. When we had discussed the process for what happens when a teacher is suspected of having sex with a student, he had said the sheriff\u2019s office would conduct an investigation. I reminded him that it\u2019s not the school or the county or the sheriff\u2019s office that\u2019s investigating Matt Gaetz, that it\u2019s the federal government, and that it's real and it\u2019s serious. I also pointed out that Gaetz\u2019s cohort has already pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing, which has been delayed because he\u2019s fully cooperating in the investigation into Gaetz \n\nHe said that the event was an important opportunity for the students. I agreed, and said that getting the chance to get facetime with their congressman is a huge opportunity for students, but that their safety was more important. I suggested that if he wouldn\u2019t cancel, then the least he could do would be to require parents\u2019 attendance. He said that wasn\u2019t something he considered. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s still not considering it, but at least it is hopefully planting ideas in his head that this is ultimately his responsibility, and there ARE options. I also suggested permission slips or waivers. At least make them acknowledge that he\u2019s a creep (allegedly).\n\nThe superintendent said that he IS getting a bunch of calls and emails, including a call from the New York Times, so that\u2019s exciting. Hopefully if we just keep it up, they school district will come to their senses. As one commenter said \u201cgod, the bar is just so low\u201d. We\u2019re not asking for much, just that you don\u2019t serve up teenage girls to an accused pedophile on a platter.\n\nAnyway, I will say I\u2019m proud of myself for standing my ground and not letting the superintendent shirk responsibility. He kept saying it wasn\u2019t the school\u2019s event, so I kept pointing out that it didn\u2019t matter whose event it was, it\u2019s happening at the school, and he is in charge of the schools. I was relatively articulate and stood my ground, so that felt good.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m in too deep to just drop it. I think I actually told him that too, now that I think about it. So I\u2019m trying to get this all out there as much as I can. All but one of the board members are up for re-election on August 23rd. I haven\u2019t heard from any of them except for one email from one of them that she would follow up, and then nothing. So I sent my post to all their opponents in the election and told them that it might be a good opportunity to blast the incumbent for inaction. I feel like there\u2019s definitely traction, and a tiny possibility that MAYBE we can get something changed.\n\nThis has been a really weird couple of days. It\u2019s been incredibly nerve-wracking, but also, it feels incredible! I highly recommend everybody tries getting involved. Everybody\u2019s comments and messages have really been so encouraging so thank you all for that.\n\nThe superintendent is getting your calls and emails, so please keep it up, ESPECIALLY if there is anybody in here that lives in Okaloosa County! Academy Night is scheduled for Tuesday, so we have until then to get it canceled. Thanks Reddit!\n\n\nEdit - here is Matt Gaetz saying he and the superintendent are friends. That checks out. https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/mattgaetz\/status\/1425301695945392130","title":"2ND UPDATE: Matt Gaetz will be speaking at a high school near me next week.

There were so many who offered encouragement and praise, I was brought to tears more times than I can count. I am truly humbled by the out pour of support and I feel honored that many felt the courage to reach out to me about their own personal experiences.\n\nI feel the need to provide this update because there were some common themes in responses where I think additional context may be appreciated.\n\n1. Yes, he is in prison and he will be there for quite some time. But no, I do not know if my statement impacted the judge\u2019s decision on length of the sentence. In my state, the victim reads their statement before the judge decides the sentence but after the Defendant has already been found guilty to the crime so, in other words, his crying\/apology and my statement in no way allowed him to \u2018get out\u2019 of the charges since he was already convicted of the crime by the Court. While the judge displayed empathy\/emotions in reaction to my statement, when they were ultimately explaining reasoning for their sentencing decision (and I\u2019m paraphrasing) \u2018It is the Court\u2019s responsibility to protect the safety of the community. When all is said and done, the Defendant committed a violent crime and the Court cannot ignore that.\u2019 I was told by the Prosecutor that the sentence he received was in line with what one would typically receive for a crime like this.   \n\n2. I\u2019ve received many questions about Restorative Justice (RJ) and notice that it\u2019s sparked some discussion in the comments. I first learned about RJ in a 60 Minutes episode (Season 51, episode 30, air date May 13, 2019). The host begins the segment with \u2018\u2019When we first learned about the RJ Project, it was hard to believe and we certainly didn\u2019t understand it. The program\u2026 introduces victims of violence to the convicts who committed the crime. Our first reaction was \u2018Who would want to do that, and to what end?\u2019\u2019 Yes, RJ is a very personal choice. It is not for everybody. And that\u2019s certainly okay!  The purpose of our Court system is to hold offenders criminally responsible for their crime but it does little to hold them accountable for the healing of the victim (and other affected parties for that matter). RJ is, in many ways, a solution for many victims and offenders who *voluntarily* choose to do it. Yes, it may not be the perfect solution but please remember that this is an imperfect system. The Defendant\u2019s participation in RJ will in no way affect his sentence. He will not get out early for choosing to participate nor he will not get additional time for refusing to either. It is simply a way for him to have the chance take accountability for the impact on the victim and allows for the opportunity to make things right using facilitation by professionals. Emphasis is placed on avoiding re-victimization at all costs.  Who knows, perhaps I'll change my mind about wanting to pursue RJ, but at least I have the option, and I will be forever grateful to the Judge for understanding and allowing it.  If and when it takes place, which wouldn't be anytime soon, he will still be in prison and I would be visiting him there.\n\n3. I received an overwhelming amount of messages with a common theme of MeToo. I wept with each one I read. To all of you I say, stay strong but also, remember to be kind to yourself. Continue to do what feels right to you. And don\u2019t feel like anyone has the right to make you feel ashamed or guilty for how you feel.  Remember, after someone experiences trauma, they deserve to feel and process it in whichever way is natural to them. If you are rape victim like me, you are used to not being believed. But don\u2019t ever feel like you have to \u2018prove\u2019 yourself to anyone. I too have moments of weakness and forget my own advice but again, in these moments, please be kind and gentle on yourself. You are doing the best you can in that moment. \n\nThank you again for your outpouring of well wishes and support. I am so truly touched by your messages <3 <3 <3 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Original Post\\*\\*\n\nTW:  sexual assault, violence, court proceedings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent 13-1\/2 long months waiting for justice after being raped by a stranger in an alley.  Yet, when it finally came time to write my Victim Impact Statement, I couldn't seem to put pen to paper.  I spent weeks working on it.  Then, after a lot of soul searching, I realized that mercy, empathy and healing were more important to me than any anger I had left.  After I realized that, I wrote my entire statement in one night.\n\nWhen I looked up after reading it in court, I saw tears coming down the judge's face.  When I looked over at my rapist, he was crying too.  So was his family.  And so was mine.  The judge approved the only request I had, to allow for Restorative Justice programming if\/when we would ever want to pursue that.  Afterward the hearing, the Victim's Advocate gave me a hug and thanked me for having the courage to say something so powerful.  I told her I meant every word.\n\nIt's hard to describe how I feel but what I can say is that it feels like a HUGE weight has been taken off my shoulders.   I will remember this experience the rest of my life and it brings me comfort to feel like I can finally start to let go.  Anyways, I have included the statement in this post - bear with me, it's a tad long.  But I feel the need to get this off of my chest.  Please remember that crime affects everyone differently and in my case, I felt like empathy and the need to pursue a different avenue (restorative justice) was right for me.  However, I can completely understand how others in this situation may feel the exact opposite.  At the end of the day though, Everyone deserves to feel how they feel!\n\n\\*\\*\\*Victim Impact Statement - TW:  sexual violence, anal rape mention\n\nThank you, Your Honor, for allowing me this opportunity to address the Court today.\n\nThis crime that the Defendant committed against me has affected every facet of my life.\n\nBefore all this happened, I knew who I was and I liked who I was. I was certain that the groundwork provided by my education, my military service, and flourishing professional career would stand me in good stead whatever challenges may lay ahead. I was proud, I was independent, and optimistic about my future. But unfortunately, the actions of the Defendant on one horrible night irreversibly changed me and the course of my life in so many ways.  After this, it felt like my life wasn\u2019t mine anymore. In one night, he shattered me into a thousand pieces, and I have spent the last 13 \u00bd months cleaning up the mess he made.\n\nFor a long time, I was not a functioning person. After this happened, I couldn\u2019t sleep for months. I stayed up, rocking back and forth with the lights on, my bedroom door barricaded because I was so afraid. You see, Your Honor, when you don\u2019t know where your attacker is, then he is everywhere. He is every sound in the night. Every noise outside your window. Always coming to get you. I spent endless nights unable to sleep, plagued by nightmares replaying what had happened to me. There were many days I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed, let alone leave my house. When I did manage to get out, I was in a constant state of hypervigilance, jumping at every little sound or movement behind me. I missed countless hours at work and my performance suffered as a result. I fell behind on my bills, even my mortgage at one point, and am still working on picking up the pieces in the many other areas of my life.\n\nFor weeks, I cried every time I went to the bathroom because of the pain from the injuries, a constant reminder of the worst night of my life. I am often riddled with anxiety and every time I feel frozen with panic, I am reminded of the sheer terror I felt while he was raping me to the point that I could barely move. I still wish I would\u2019ve fought back harder but, in hindsight, my body was frozen in both fear and pain. The moment he inserted himself into me anally, an act that I had never experienced before that moment, it felt like my body had been split into two. The kind of pain where you\u2019re frozen in place. A kind of pain I will surely never forget. It consumes you and there is nothing you can do. When it was over, I remember running away from him in fear, thinking that he would surely come after me. Another feeling that still sticks with me to this day. The flashbacks did not begin for several months but once they did, they came with a fury. On a good day, they would last for only a few seconds, leading me into a panic attack with a lingering aftermath lasting a day or two. On a bad day, they went on for what seemed like hours and were every bit as physically and emotionally painful as the real event often resulting in several days of missed work to recover. On the worst day, I was hospitalized.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I am taking medications for things like anxiety, sleep, mood, and nightmares. Over the past year, I\u2019ve attended over 30 appointments with my medical providers, most of them for psychiatric services or mental health therapy, but several were also for mental health urgent care and even one hospitalization. I am very fortunate to receive low cost healthcare because without it, I\u2019m not sure I would be in the place I am today.  In total, my medical bills amounted to only hundreds of dollars, as reflected in the Restitution form, but more so I think they truly represent the significant impact this has had on me.\n\nFor a long time, my faith in others was destroyed. I silently condemned every man I didn\u2019t know, since I automatically assumed that their only intention was to harm me. I felt unreasonable revulsion for any individuals who looked like the Defendant, making it nearly impossible at times to interact with fellow colleagues, my healthcare professionals, and even some friends, all at no fault of their own, but all because they simply resembled the Defendant.\n\nI think it\u2019s worth mentioning that I do not know the Defendant, Mr <removed name>, he is a complete stranger to me. I am not \u2018out to get him\u2019 because I don\u2019t even know him. I still remember the officer asking me if I knew the name of the man who had raped me, and I realized I had no idea who he was, a feeling I fear may stay with me for a very long time to come. In fact, I did not even learn his name until several days after he was arrested when someone at the DA\u2019s office casually brought it up in conversation without the slightest idea that I was hearing his name for the first time. I\u2019ll never forget that moment. It took my breath away. Even now, over a year later, there\u2019s a sort of empty hole inside of me because of this and there\u2019s not a single day that goes by where I don\u2019t think about what the Defendant did to me.\n\nProbably the most unpleasant feeling is that of the lasting guilt. Not for the rape-- that was on the Defendant -- But for the consequences of doing the \u201cright thing\u201d and reporting to the authorities: putting a man behind bars and causing his loved ones to suffer immensely.  I think about this often.\n\nThe punishment he receives today will no doubt be difficult for him, but I am someone who generally looks for the best in people and I have to believe that you, Mr. <removed name>, are strong enough to overcome this, and that somewhere in the process you will seize the opportunities for healing and growth. The most important thing is to ensure events like these don\u2019t happen, ever.\n\nIn reality, I do not believe people should be defined by the worst moment of their life and what I seek more than anything else is peace of mind. Having, in a sense, been served with my own sentence, I must find a way to live out my life in peace. If it were up to me, the only resolution I would seek is that of restorative justice. I want nothing more than for the Defendant to take responsibility for his actions, understand the significant impact that this has had on not only me, but many others in both of our lives, and to learn from this, so that all parties involved can move on with their lives. Which leads me to the only request I have for you today, Your Honor, I ask that you consider amending the No Contact Order to allow for an exception for the case of restorative justice programming.\n\nI understand that this is not the time or place to facilitate restorative justice practices and that the purpose of the judicial court is to hold individuals criminally responsible for their actions so, I will only say this further. I hope one day, Mr <removed name>, you can find the courage from knowing that your participation in this type of programming will not result in punitive punishment. You know what happened on the night of January <removed specific date>, 2019. You know and I know. And you can\u2019t erase that.  Most importantly, remember that you are paying the price of your own choices, while I have to pay the price of a choice that you did not give me. This request I ask of the Judge today is about giving you the opportunity to take accountability for your actions and a chance to make things right, not only for you and me, but for all of our loved ones who have been affected by this as well.\n\nI sincerely hope that you find strength, companionship, and moments of peace to reflect in these difficult days. I wish safety, health, and continued support from your loved ones while in incarceration. I know that I would not have made it here today without the incredible support network that I have found in my family, colleagues, and friends since this happened. After finishing your punishment, I sincerely hope you reintegrate quickly into society and go on to live a happy life. Most importantly, I hope you are able to find the inner courage within to accept accountability for your actions.\n\nAnd with that being said, I leave here today, Your Honor, with a sense of peace, confident in knowing that whatever you decide for sentencing today will be appropriate and just. After all, justice is not justice, if it is not just for all.\n\nThank you","title":"I read my Victim Impact Statement in court yesterday. My rapist cried when I read it. So did the judge.

Whenever men fiddle around in their pockets, I always get this flash of paranoia that they're secretly jerking off to the fact that we're unaware. Today it actually happened.\n\nI work at a rather popular coffee chain, and our particular location is incredibly busy, fast paced, and stressful. Customers haven't exactly been the nicest during the pandemic, and I have to put up with a lot of verbal harassment, and I've had people actually threaten to come inside to throw some hands, but this really takes the cake.\n\nI'm a supervisor and took over at the window for my co-worker's break. Two customers into this line, this guy pulls up to collect his order. I kindly greet him, look at his face, repeat his order and hand him his stuff. I noticed he was having a rather hard time focusing on putting his damn card in the stupid chip reader. I was focused on him paying for his shit, so my eyes were on his card, waiting for the \"approved\" text to flash across the screen. An error appeared instead, and as I was about to ask him to try sliding the card, my eyes curiously focused in on what he was doing with his right hand.\n\nI saw something wrinkly and shriveled up in his hand, and at first, I thought it might have been his wallet stuffed with bills, but then I realized it was his *tiny, flaccid, wrinkly, caterpillar looking ass, Jabba the Hutt looking ass penis*. He was fucking *WANKING HIMSELF* while staring into my eyes. I was shocked, disgusted, and very angry. Unfortunately for him, I'm very loud, and very vocal.\n\n*\"WHAT THE FUCK .\"* I yelled. Customers in the lobby could hear me shouting, poor things. My coworkers were shocked, and confused. \"ARE YOU FUCKING *SERIOUS*, DUDE?!\"\n\nHe's wearing a mask, but I could see his eyes crinkle. He smiled at me. Of *course* he was pleased by my reaction.\n\nHe quickly yanks his card away, and attempts to speed off, but gets stuck behind two other cars in the drive thru. I stick my head out the window to memorize his plate number, but realize I'm in too much of a panic to think straight, so I run to the front of the store, throw the door open, and whip out my phone to take pictures of his truck as he speeds off. \n\nUnfortunately for him, my phone camera takes *wonderful* pictures. The resolution was crisp and I could clearly read the plate number. I called the police, and they showed up a whopping two hours later. After some research on their end, they pulled up the owner of the car, who was a lady. They called the number, and spoke to a man who apparently was her husband. He had an alibi, but named his 18 year old son who lives with them. He was shocked and apologetic, and said he'd \"talk to his son\", whatever that means. The police officer made it clear we didn't want them returning to our location, and that he would be arrested for trespassing. \n\nMy coworker recognized him and his car; he had come through our drive thru just two days prior to today. I have many young, female coworkers, a few who *only just* turned 18, that I don't want subjected to this kind of crap. I can't imagine how mortified and frozen with fear they would have been.\n\nHopefully the official police report gets finalized soon so that I can get a fucking restraining order on this dude. I'm so upset, I want to take it even further and get him put on a sex offender list. Ugh.\n\nWhy. Why?\n\nEdit:\n\nSince apparently *some* people think my post is fake, here's a fake collage of fake photos I took of his fake truck as he fake drove off through the fake parking lot.\n\nAnother edit:\n\nSome people messaged concerned for my safety, so I took the pictures of the truck down. I had no idea this post would blow up. Apparently the picture is still visible, so I messaged the mods to see if it can be removed.\n\nAnother another edit:\n\nI'm absolutely blown away by all the comments and messages I've been receiving. Thank you guys! For the awards, the kind words, the well wishes. I'm just really tired. I only got a few hours of sleep last night, I laid awake with my eyes closed for at least an hour. I'll be back later to try and respond to people as things calm down. But I hope that the victims and women out there feel just a bit more empowered to act and do something when they feel afraid of freezing up. And I hope you have people in your lives who would stick up for you, and do everything I did and more to protect you. We don't deserve this crap. \u2665\ufe0f I hope you guys are having a wonderful day.","title":"Today a dick in my drive thru decided it would be appropriate to start masturbating in front of me as I handed him his food.

When I told my husband that I found blood in her panties, he told me to take her to the doctor in the morning. After a physical and blood work, it was concluded that there was no infection and the blood was from physical trauma. I brought her to my husband at work (he wasn't there the night before or that day because he is a firefighter and was working a 48hr shift) and told him the doctor was concerned about sexual trauma and asked if there was anyone in his family that we should be worried about, he told me that his brother and sister both made allegations of sexual abuse against his mother when they were teenagers (now in their late 20s), that the abuse occured when they were roughly 3-7 years old, and that he simply \"forgot\" to tell me. I cannot even wrap my head around this. How does someone forget something like this? How does someone not immediately tell a potential partner (I was a single mom with 2 children when we started dating, he has since adopted both of them) before allowing very young children around this person? I can never trust him again. I cannot trust his judgement. I feel like I've failed my children as a mother. I'm beside myself with grief over what may have happened to my daughter and the shambles that my marriage has become overnight. I wish I could go back. Things will never be the same. And the thought of navigating the world as a a single woman with children and no support system is absolutely terrifying. \n\nTL;DR- daughter may have been molested by MIL. Since this concern has come to light, husband just now told me that he \"forgot\" to tell me that two of his siblings accused MIL of molesting them as young children. I'm distraught.\n\nETA: (Because I'm tired of being fussed at by people who won't bother to read any of my comments), To clarify- I brought her home late that night and noticed the blood as I was getting her jammies on before putting her in bed. I took her the very next morning to the pediatrician for evaluation. Upon his recommendation, I took her that afternoon to a SANE nurse for a recorded exam in Atlanta. That evening I called both law enforcement and DFCS to make my reports. I brought the SANE recording and the clothes she was wearing as evidence to the sheriff's office the very next day and met with a special victims investigator to open a case. I also met with the DFCS case worker that day and reported everything and opened a case with them. We took her to a forensic interview completed by a child psychologist by the end of the week and she has since been put into therapy. And obviously, she has had no further contact with any of my husband's family, especially his mother. No physical, no phone calls, nothing. Please stop telling me to do these things and telling me I'm a horrible mother for not. I've done them. ASAP. I'm doing everything I can, and drowning while doing it. Give me a break.","title":"Husband \"forgot\" to tell me his mother is a paedophile.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/rsh2iu\/husband_forgot_to_tell_me_his_mother_is_a\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

Throwaway for privacy.\n\nI have seen a lot of stories come forth about what life is like when you have a little extra melanin. I have a lot of friends that sympathize, but they cannot really fathom what it is like. I wanted to share mine. For reference, I grew up in a middle class area in a liberal state. If this is not the place for this, please let me know. But these are experiences that I have lived. Sorry about the length and thank you for reading. On mobile so formatting.\n\n\nAge 5: My best friend was a blonde little girl. One day, we were walking out of our kindergarten class together, and her father saw us walking together. He rushed forward and put his arm around her shoulder and ushered her away from me as quickly as he could. Later in the school year, we wanted to hang out after school like little five year old girls do. Her mother called my mother and told her how my mom made her uncomfortable, and she no longer wished to have us be friends.\n\nAge 5 on: Having people be surprised that my mom is white, and be ridiculed for it.\n\nAge 8: Called a n***** and told to get off of someone\u2019s property, I was told that I was allowed to play there.\n\nAge 10: Approached by a basketball coach and forced to play(I had NO talent for basketball).\n\nAge 14: Shopping for dresses with my best friend. As we wondered the store, the same clerk followed us. They try to hide it, they are putting away clothes. We ask my mom why we keep seeing her, and my mom tells us that we are getting the \u201cspecial treatment\u201d.\n\nAge 15: Shopping for hair supplies at a store aimed at black hair products. The Asian owner followed us the entire time, \u201cstraightening up\u201d right next to us. When we tried to leave after buying something, which she saw, before we could leave the store, she accused us of shoplifting. She had literally just watched us buy the item that she observed us select from her special treatment.\n\nAge 17: My now husband and I had just gotten out of school, and we walked down the street to the Rite Aid to get some snacks. The security guard refused to allow me to inter the store with my backpack, and they made us leave it up front at the cashier. The guard proceeded to just happen to be patrolling the store in whatever area we were in.\n\nAge 18: I realized how difficult it is to find a hair stylist, because you can 100% tell when someone is afraid to touch your hair, or how obvious it becomes that they have no idea what they\u2019re doing. But you learn to just pay them and don\u2019t go back.\n\nAge 19: We decided to get married. My husband\u2019s dad told him, \u201cYou know she\u2019s black. Your kids will be too.\u201d His uncle told him he couldn\u2019t believe he was marrying a n*****. His dad still treats me like absolute shit to this day. We have gone low contact.\n\nAge 20: Realized that when I\u2019m not being followed while I\u2019m shopping, when I actually want help I get treated like I\u2019m wasting their time. Or it\u2019s hard to even find someone that will talk to me.\n\nAge 20: I was at in class a predominately white university. I was the only black student in the class while we were reviewing Langston Hughes, and I was asked more than anyone to give my thoughts on the experiences he talked about.\n\nAge 21: Attempted to get a job as a 911 dispatcher. I made it all the way to the portion where you have a super long interview about your life with a sheriff. He continually asked me about my \u201ctroubled past\u201d(There isn\u2019t one) and he didn\u2019t believe me when I told him that I have NEVER been in trouble for anything. He asked me if I\u2019d ever had sex in the car, or in any public places. To this day I don\u2019t know why that was relevant. I did not get the job.\n\nAge 22: I got hired at my current organization because I\u2019m black and I speak Spanish. How do I know? The manager that hired me told me, \u201cThank God you speak Spanish, when I saw that you were black and that you\u2019re fluent, that\u2019s all I needed to know!\u201d She proceeded to try to performance manage me out, in an attempt to say \u201cWell, we tried to hire a minority but it just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nAge 23: I ran into the same dad from my age 5 recount while I was at work one day. He knew I got married because his daughter was my bridesmaid. He proceeded to tell me how he daughter had done things \u201cthe right way\u201d by going to school and finishing first before dating\/getting into a relationship, and that he was so proud of her, but was sorry that I hadn\u2019t had the same luck.\n\nAge 24: People are surprised at how long and \u201csoft looking\u201d my hair is. I get asked a lot if it\u2019s a weave or if I\u2019ve permed it. A lot of unsolicited touching. Can we take a second and imagine that in reverse? I\u2019ve never had my hands in a white girl\u2019s hair, but imagine if I walked up to a complete stranger, announced that fact, and ran my fingers through her hair. I\u2019d probably get arrested for assault.\n\nAge 25: I was newly pregnant. It was my third pregnancy, but I had no living babies. My previous doctor couldn\u2019t see me, so I had to find a new one. I found an OB that would see me, and my husband came. The doctor spent the entire time(without actually examining me) telling me how this pregnancy was not viable. He would not let me leave without getting a STD test. I told him my husband and I are exclusive and we\u2019d been together for 11 years. \u201cWell, you never know.\u201d He took the sample anyway during my pelvic exam. When he did the ultrasound, he happily proclaimed that he was right, my uterus was empty. He offered to redo it in 2 weeks. When I left, the nurse gave me multiple pamphlets about being a black mom, and over the next several days I got calls from social workers offering free services and items for low income minority mothers. I never asked for that. They didn\u2019t know my income. That same baby from that non-viable pregnancy is a year and a half now.\n\nAge 25: It was a group of us out dress shopping for my best friend\u2019s wedding. We stopped for lunch, and we had to wait for the restaurant to open. We were first waiting at the door, but were not seated first(This restaurant does not take reservations). They proceeded to proceed and wait on 6 other tables, who had ordered and gotten their food, before we were even approached to order our meals.\n\nAge 26: I was pregnant with my daughter and I called into the doctor\u2019s office multiple times with alarming symptoms. My blood pressure was high, and my limbs were so swollen I couldn\u2019t sleep because they were hot and throbbing. My symptoms were dismissed until it was almost too late. Even when I was at the ER with trouble breathing and a pain in my chest, I was almost sent home. I still thank God for the OB that ran to grab me before I got discharged and diagnosed me with pre-ecclampsia. She saved mine and my daughter\u2019s lives.\n\nAge 26: My daughter was in the NICU for 66 days. Any concerns I raised about her care were brushed under the rug. There was a point where I complained to multiple nurses about the mask that they pushed into her face, and they were ignored. She has a scar on her nose now that was 100% preventable.\n\nI want everyone to just imagine for a moment. Imagine that you just got a job. You\u2019re ecstatic. But you walk in on your first day scared out of your mind, because you know you have to prove you\u2019re worthy to be there. There is no one else that looks like you.  Imagine going shopping. Minding your own business when you notice the same person keeps asking you for help. Imagine not knowing if your friend group looks down on you because of how you look. Imagine your health, your feelings, your LIFE not being taken seriously. Imagine being made out to be a criminal before anyone even knows you, and being told \u201cwow, you\u2019re not like other black girls\u201d. Imagine being told \u201cWow, you\u2019re pretty\/intelligent\/well-spoken for a black girl.\u201d Imagine being questioned in your own home, or on your way home, simply because you look like someone that committed a crime.\n\nHave you ever been pulled over by a police officer? Were you scared? What did you say? Imagine being pulled out of your car because the officer suspects you to have drugs, but you were on your way to school. You\u2019re forced out of the car, put in cuffs and you\u2019ve got a boot on your back while you watch the cop\u2019s partner plant the drugs in your own car. You go to prison for it. Your life is forever changed. Or this, that you were a little tired coming home from work, and you swerved a little. The officer pulls you over and arrests you for a DUI, regardless of having a 0.0 BAC.\n\nI luckily have not been a victim of police brutality. However, my own brother has. He approached a man and was asking for assistance. The man claimed he had a gun, which he didn\u2019t. That was apparently all the proof the court needed to convict, and he went to prison for three years.\n\nPlease, tell me again that we are equal. Please, tell me again that we should protest peacefully. We tried that. He took a knee during the national anthem and was fired for it. Tell me again that I should just deal with how things are, and to learn my place. That I should understand that I am intimidating because of my skin tone.\n\nNo. I will not sit down. I will not make excuses anymore that this is okay. I do not want to have to explain to my daughter and son how to not get shot by a police officer, because no matter what we do, no matter how little we resist and go with the flow, we are injured. We are set up. We are jailed. We are MURDERED simply for existing. There is no more time to be quiet. Yes, all lives absolutely matter. But the problem is that black lives matter less than white lives. The system needs to change, and it starts with you.\n\nNo more silence.","title":"My experience being a woman of color in the US","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/gzq3c9\/my_experience_being_a_woman_of_color_in_the_us\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false}

I found out a week ago, by accident. I never reported him and nobody knew what happened. A girl I met in my hometown last month told about that guy who lost his balls in a street fight or something. She said it's a big secret and I shouldn't tell anyone. Lol. A secret that all the neighbourhood is gossiping about.\n\nI came home and started laughing. I knew I had to tell someone, so I'm telling you. I'm so happy right now. I never reported it because I didn't want my parents to know about it. I didn't want them to be upset, to feel bad for me. I didn't want to go through humiliation of trying to prove it was rape. I didn't want people talk about me as a rape victim, or a liar.\n\nWhen I was laying there, being raped, I had 2 thoughts in my mind: first, my parents shouldn't know about it, and second \u2014 what should I do after he cums inside me. I didn't resist, maybe a little bit in the beginning, because I was scared this man who is twice bigger than me will hurt me even more. I didn't want him to hit me, break my ribs, give me bruises because my parents would know and everyone would know. Come to think of it, he probably didn't even think he was a rapist. Yeah, I told no and stop, pushed him away, but he probably thought I was a tease and I wanted it. That's what they always think. And when I stopped struggling \u2014\u00a0he decided it's totally consensual so after a while he pulled out and flipped me to try different position. That's when I saw his balls within a reaching distance of my knee, and kicked him.\n\nI kicked him more so that he doesn't get up and retaliate. You know, it's funny that I was raped that night, but the hardest thing about it was kicking a person who is already lying down and crying in pain. It's actually pretty hard to inflict pain on someone else, did you know that? I had to do it because if he'd get up, he'd kill me. When I left, he was vomiting.\n\nTurns out, he lost both his balls that night. If he had a choice \u2014 going to jail for 5-10 years, or living the rest of his life as a eunuch \u2014 I guess he'd chosen jail. I can't help but be content about what happened to him.\n\nSo yeah, moral of the story \u2014\u00a0don't rape people. And women, remember how fragile men's balls are. If they are hurting you and you have a chance to kick them \u2014 go for it. Don't be afraid to hurt a rapist.","title":"My rapist won't rape anyone ever again","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/c06x8h\/my_rapist_wont_rape_anyone_ever_again\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

I cared for a healthy woman who went into full heart failure and needed a heart transplant after pregnancy. Women have died from strokes the day after delivery. I had a woman in the ICU on a ventilator for a month after having a pulmonary embolism at home. I've watched women scream at the top of their lungs for an hour and they can't even scream anymore. I've watched women seize and turn blue. I've watched a 15 year old girl deliver her baby naturally because her mother wouldn't sign the consent form for an epidural. She needed to be punished.\n\nNo woman deserves the punishment of childbirth as a consequence of their crime of having sex. We don't torture the most sick criminals this way.

My oldest son got into an accident and got severely injured a few months ago. He is better now and still recovering but things were looking really horrible for a few weeks after the accident.\n\nWhile my oldest was in a coma, it was my youngest sons birthday. I feel like crap for it but I completely forgot. I was so terrified that my older son would die that I couldn\u2019t think of much else. My ex husband and I spent every waking hour at the hospital and regrettably weren\u2019t really there for our youngest. He was staying with my ex\u2019s sister.\n\nMy youngest came to visit his brother the day after his birthday and he hugged my ex and I, and said he loved us and thanks for doing something for him even in these circumstances. My ex and I had no clue what he was talking about but we assumed my ex\u2019s sister must\u2019ve done something for him and said we had a hand in it.\n\nI just found out that it wasn\u2019t my ex\u2019s sister, it was his girlfriend. She baked a really cool cake for him, bought him a new gaming chair and headset that he wanted, and took it to him on his birthday saying they were from me and my ex. She even wrote a card in the POV of me and his dad and signed off saying \u201cnever forget how much we love you - mum and dad\u201d. \n\nI asked my ex if he told her to do that but he said he didn\u2019t even know she had, and that she never mentioned it. \n\nNow I\u2019m crying. That was so incredibly sweet of her to do in a time where I feel like I failed my youngest. And the fact that she gave my ex and I credit for her work when she doesn\u2019t even know me and wasn\u2019t asked to do it makes me emotional.

But the nearer I get to 24 and the further I get from 17, the *creepier* it becomes. My brother is 17. I cannot **imagine** dating someone his age and I'm only 22. I literally cannot A) see any worthwile reason for dating a high schooler and B) see them as anything but kids. Young adults, but kids. \n\nI think it really hit me when I realised recently that my ex could easily have been one of my teachers. In fact, that's what he was attending school for (no word on how that worked out). Imagining my brother dating one of his teachers just made me feel gross.\n\nThe relationship trudged on for far longer than was necessary. I used to hate his friends for calling me a 12-year-old\/baby\/jailbait and him a pedo\/etc and while I don't think they were always actively trying to \"warn\" me, it should have been a giant fucking red flag the size of Alaska. \n\nThere were a shitload of other problems in the relationship, such as him telling me in all seriousness that he sometimes didn't think others were real and wanting to cut me open to see my organs to verify that I was human (as someone who experiences dissociative + depersonalization to begin with, that was a real treat). There was also extremely fraught and reluctant knifeplay, the time I was goaded into cutting myself again (which I had just overcome after 6 years of treatment) for his sexual gratification, and all the underage drinking and weed usage. I am 100% convinced that I ingested something that was not weed once because I have **never** reacted so badly to marijuana in my life previously or since. I legitimately felt like I was dying. I don't like to think about it. \n\nAnyway, I know after that last paragraph and myself knowing everything else that happened it seems weird to get hung up on *just* the age gap but good lord that should have been my notice to vacate.\n\n#EDIT: Let me be VERY CLEAR that I am not condemning or judging anyone who is an ADULT and is in a relationship with an age gap no matter how large or small. If you want to date someone however many years your senior\/junior GO WILD as long as everyone is consenting, is capable of consenting, and is an ADULT. I would like to point out that I was a MINOR. \n\nAnd yes, it is my \"fault\" that I dated him, but I really don't see what challenging me to assign fault to myself accomplishes. Hooray, you're right, it's my fault! I am well aware that I should have declined his advances and merrily carried on with my life. I know that I could have stopped it before things went too far. The fact of the matter is that I didn't. Whose \"fault\" this was is immaterial.\n\nFor all of you mentioning \"half your age plus seven,\" I would like to note that half of 24 plus 7 is 19, so...","title":"The older I get the less understanding I am of a 24-year-old-man being at all interested in a 17-year old girl.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/ijzdfx\/the_older_i_get_the_less_understanding_i_am_of_a\/","upvote_ratio":0.78,"over_18":true}

I should\u2019ve known better than to go out with him and his friends when they were that intoxicated. I should\u2019ve stepped off the subway right away and went back home when I realized how drunk they were, but I thought things were better now. I would learn that night just how wrong I was. In hindsight, I should\u2019ve left him entirely a long time ago. \n\nThey started bullying me during that subway ride and so I got off at the next stop when I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. They followed me off and he was so angry at me. He pushed me hard and I fell down. When I tried running up the stairs, he came for me again and so I punched him in the face. This only made him angrier and so he pushed me onto the stairs as I was climbing, and then picked me up and threw me down the stairs. Then they all ran away and left me there lying at the bottom. \n\nI pulled myself up quickly and sat on those same steps wondering how the fuck I let myself end up here. You approached me and asked me if I was okay. I recognized you, as you were sitting near us on the subway (I was looking around at everyone because I was embarrassed people were watching) . You saw the whole thing happen. You gave me a pat on the back, and walked away. Eventually I left the underground and sat just outside the station. I didn\u2019t know what to do. What I wasn\u2019t expecting, was for my angry ex to return to the station, angry that I didn\u2019t follow him. I sat there while he threatened and screamed at me. If I fought him I\u2019d have lost, he was so much stronger and there was nowhere to run. \n\nOut of nowhere a police car shows up and separates us. He sent my ex away and helped me call a cab to a friends house. That\u2019s when I noticed you, standing off to the distance, watching. And when my ex finally walked away out of eyesight, you went back down into the subway tunnel. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but I now realize it was you that called the cop. He told me someone had called. And you watched them getting aggressive with me on the subway, and followed us off to make sure I was okay. You called the police even after I told you it was okay. IDK what would\u2019ve happened if you didn\u2019t. \n\nThank you. I can never thank you enough. I think about you all the time. Thank you for caring enough to take time out of your day to help me.

Yesterday I walked into my parents house to catch him red handed with his pants down. Literally. With my 11 year old nephew. I saw red and confronted him. I was lying about what I saw, I needed to calm down, he said. My mother was silent. With no thought process, no plan, I kept telling my nephew he was not in trouble he just needed to be honest. He confirmed it wasn\u2019t the first time. I called the police and stood outside with my nephew. Chain smoked cigarettes until the deputies arrived. Everyone was so...quiet and calm. He\u2019s expected to serve 25 years minimum. And he\u2019s old. I know he\u2019s going to die in there. So far only the arresting officer has called me to check in. No investigation questions, just genuine concern. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen now. My mom has no income and has still not apologized to me.

She's been streaming games on the platform for years, and more recently was one of the first big creators to pivot into regular \"hot-tub\" streams. She's also a prolific OnlyFans creator. It has just come to light that she's been in an extremely abusive relationship since 2016. And this came out from her unmuting her stream while he was berating her to the point of tears over the phone. It's a long stream and not everything is in the article, so here's the rundown. This is where the TW gets real.\n\n* He forced her to do a 24 hour uninterrupted stream, saying that he'd kill her dogs if she didn't\n* He threatened to kick her out of the house for mishearing him\n* Apparently it was his \"idea\" for her to switch to hot tub streams, and people think he might be \"encouraging\" her to produce as much OnlyFans content as she does. Either way, he definitely takes all the money from both, which lead us to...\n* \"I built this empire off your body.\" Because that's how you talk to your wife. He's forcing her to do provocative content around the clock and taking the proceeds. He's a pimp for his ***wife***, and he ***admits*** it.\n* Text messages show that he controls all of her finances, and has threatened to sink her life's savings into crypto speculations if she crosses him. Very Britney.\n* He wouldn't let her even reveal that she was married, because he thought that her presenting as a single woman doing OF and tub streams was more profitable.\n* Here we get more into user (and me) speculation. She streams anywhere from 12-16 hours a day, usually in a pool\/hot tub with multiple outfit changes and sub goals for squats and such. And when she isn't streaming, she does a lot of OnlyFans. As the dog clip shows, these long stream segments may be coerced. She seems to hardly sleep. She's fallen asleep onstream before, and she occasionally streams herself sleeping (alone, in her room) at night. She presents as a single woman, including sleeping apart from her husband on a livestream to bring in cash while she isn't even awake. And all of her income goes into an account under her husband's control. A lot of things are falling into place for me. Nearly every time I open Twitch, she's live to thousands of people. I thought she was just grinding, because she rakes in ludicrous amounts of money from donos\/subs\/OF\/etc. But it looks like she was basically working in a sweatshop for some Alvin and the Chipmunks sounding asshole who the Internet didn't know existed for six years.\n\nThis is horrifying. Abuse can happen to anyone, and anyone can be made to feel powerless. Amouranth is one of the biggest Twitch streamers. She's friends with a dozen other massive creators. She has an audience of millions. And she was under the thumb of an abusive faceless man, and the only way she could start the conversation of getting the word out that she wasn't safe was to keep her stream going during an abusive outburst. She had to show herself crying and being berated to a live audience of thousands because that was the only way she could start the process of exposing her pain. She felt like she couldn't just leave, file for divorce, or reach out to her friends (none of them knew any of this either). I'm just speechless.\n\n**Edit:** A friend of Amouranth's says that she is \"at least physically safe.\"\n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this, it's the \"I built this empire off your body\" line. Genuinely chilling. When I was digesting all this on my own, that's the one that really broke me.\n\n**Edit 2:** You can always tell when something hits r\\_all because a bunch of people show up making excuses for the abuser lmaoi","title":"[TW] Turns out one of the biggest streamers on Twitch is basically a slave to her abusive husband.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/y5zsu4\/tw_turns_out_one_of_the_biggest_streamers_on\/","upvote_ratio":0.85,"over_18":false}

of all, i am literally typing in tears , i feel so helpless and insignificant, i feel like i am fighting a losing fight Everytime i speak\n\n\nAnd i am not even the targeted minority here, we have legit 99.99% of rape and harrasement victims of the entire female population, \n\n\nWe have such a toxic culture , where if you got raped your social life is over and you should kill yourself \"sheikhs have said that\" and that the only way out of it is marrying the bloody rapist , so girls just never tell\n\n\nBut in private and in a safe space everyone has over a shit ton of stories, girls get raped no matter what age or what they were , then some sheikhs come and say \"they provoked it on themselves by wearing those clothes\" \n\n\nThen u ask what clothes are ok, they go anything other than a hot short, some other will go, no anything other than hijab is wrong and worthy of rape, and some go no no it's either niqab or rape, and some go, that women getting out of their houses is enough to provoke men\n\n\nThey are literally  excusing actual rape, and some young sheikh with 2 million followers was asked \"what about women who wear niqab yet get raped?\" He replied \" it's because men saw earlier women wearing provocative clothing, so the pent up pressure is forced upon them\"\n\n\nWHAT, I don't mind horrible and dumb thinking , but not when it has this influence and has no logic or proof or sense or anything\n\n\nImagine having Christian friends in this community, if i walk with a girl in the street we get harrased together and commented on, and people walk up to is saying dumb and offensive stuff like \"get out of here we don't want sluts like you here\" \"hey prostitute come to me after him please\"\n\n\nAnd the worst part is, i am a coward, I can't stand up though i know i am right, i can't defend or help anyone because i know if i even try to do anything they will harm both me and her horribly, and it will be without purpose\n\n\nI open social media to find 80% of people supporting rape culture , actual rape, because who wouldn't when you have the power, every female friend I've gotten close to has told me a story of messed up sexual harrasement, and many of them have shared suicidal thoughts \n\n\nAny woman who tries to say anything is branded an \"atheist\" and a dumb \"feminist\", if a woman walks alone , no matter what she is wearing has the chance of 99.99% of getting raped or harrased, and he can't tell anyone or defend herself or either she is a dumb atheist feminist and how dare she think she has the same rights as men to walk in the street\n\n\nAnd why would i come whine here, is it karma whoring, or virtue signaling\n\n\nNo, the issue is that people that share my thoughts here are people who are already rich enough to live in upper class and have enough influence and money to stop it, never face people like this, so we have not much of any activism\n\n\nI have no platform, money, followers, looks, smarts, anything\n\n\nI always came to reddit to find relatable people and ignore the hell hole i live in, but it's becoming harder everyday, and i am scared and weak, I don't even know what i want\n\n\nIf anyone can do anything, wether awareness, support or any form of help \n\n\nPlease do, i hate being a weakling but that is who i am, i hope i can reach out to someone or people that can help, save me, save us\n\n\n(edit:many people have this misconception , but i am a male, and i don't promote the idea of just travelling to a safe space, though logical and should be done,the idea of giving up on my country and leaving my friends and family behind to rot is holding me back , and stop blaming islam corrupt people will use whatever people are following and twist it)\n \nGoing even deeper, women aren't encouraged to find a job or travel or study much, as much as they are told \"when you marry a man, you'll be free to do as you please\", newsflash ,nope\n\nThere was a story of 2 women surrounded by 200 rapists, they sat in a store and called for help, and out was standing the rapists trying to get in, the  store owner had to kick them out because they might cause his property damage, from start to finish it is recorded and it is horrifying,and media said \"it's up for debate, did you see what they wore\", literally they had to get 4 male friends fighting a crowd of gropers who laughed as they pulled them from clothes and hair as they were crying\n\nWomen get called horrible shit and bullied online, people \"sliding\"into the dms with entitlement, that if women don't respond , they steal pictures and threaten them with photoshoping them on nude bodies and ruin their lives and share them, while sending horrendous comments and pictures, and that is not extreme cases it also is a the norm\n\nPeople who grope in public, harras online, black mail , are considered \"cool\" people \"living the life\"\n\nPeople of our community are discouraged to travel and leave the country, it's considered unpatriotic, and they always go \"look at their politicial issues, the even accept gays, they are no better than us if not worse, stay in a muslim country\" ,so most people think that this is the same everywhere, so no one seeks change or asylum as much\n\n(People on reddit are twisting my words and using them to push political views, the same issue i am against, i stated facts of what happens, that any research will prove me right, i have said my own personal experience that many in the comments share similar experiences if not worse, if i am being punished for saying what is happening and what i feel about it , then so be it)\n\nBut i never advocate they stop taking immigrants, i support it whole heartedly,and it the most reasonable choice for us, and should be accepted by all\n\nI never said i am against islam and said my issue was never with islam, it's with corrupt people in power here who use whatever works to control people, wether comedy, religion,culture,\nPlus i am a Christian hence my name, and there are Christian people using Christian faith to support this insanity, so apparently the way i see it, the issie is with culture not religion currently\n\nPeople will put their fingers in their ears and say i am a puppet, or i am a blind retard who supports islam, or a puppet made to be anti islam, the the whole post is about people like you who twist words to get what they want \n\nI am not saying arabs are bad, i am saying we still have a long road to go, and i hope we go it , so people DMing or commenting, do some research then come with an argument, not \"he's wrong, cuz I don't want to think about this\"\n\n\nAnd if you want to do research, there is the story of the 2 girls surrounded by the 200 rapists with videos proof, there is the story of the rapist of over 100 in the auc his name is ahmed something and was only jailed because public outcry but  will be let loose in no time after the fuss is over, just like what happend last time when another controversy happened when a teen killed another teen for defending a hirl from sexual harrasement, while caught in camer, it was glossed over , and you have sheikh abdullah elroshdy , he is one of the famous radical fake sheikhs, who abuses people's lack of knowledge and uses islam as a veil for his extremist thoughts, and he has a huge following\n\nThe problem is, no one in Egypt is denying these things happened, the problem is hos they excuse it, do your research if you want, talk to any girl who lives in egypt, males here don't notice it, and won't notice it unless they get  of their own way and they excuse it in their head, i am jot cherry picking, literally ask any girl who lives in Egypt","title":"Egypt is a hellhole and

I have about 2 cents in my bank account, I am a 21 year old female. I\u2019m currently uninsured, I\u2019m a full time student (on my own) who is also a Resident Assistant, and works for the Campus Recycling Center. Being an RA covers my college room and board, and I get a stipend of $20 bi weekly. I work 8 hours a week at the recycling center and get about $120 bi weekly. That\u2019s a grand total of $140 every two weeks. So I\u2019ve been avoiding going to the doctors because I really cannot afford it. I tried using Monistat ($16) because that worked the last time I was yeasty. It didn\u2019t work this time. \n\nMy male sexual partner has insurance so I suggested that he go to Planned Parenthood to get an STI test done just for us to be safe. He did and he came up clean, but he also went out of his way to ask about yeast infections while he was there. \n\nPlanned Parenthood explained the complications of yeast infections and that sometimes it needs a medicine to clear it up. He also asked Planned Parenthood about payment. Based on my income, the visit AND treatment would be under $30. I can afford that easily. I made my appointment despite only have 2 cents in my bank account. \n\nI made my appointment online. It was so easy that I did it during my ecology lecture. It was a little weird having \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u201d pop up on my phone screen, my professor probably thinks I\u2019m pregnant now. But overall it took maybe 7 minutes.\n\nI had my appointment yesterday morning and it went literally so well. My male partner brought me. Everyone working  there was female! I had two young females assist me. They spoke to me like a real person with a real issue, and they really empathized with me. (Because all vaginas have maintenance issues at one point or another). We talked about birth control, yeast, diabetes, college, and I felt zero judgement. They got their samples and ran their tests. The yeast infection was positive, and they gave me medicine right there on the spot. One for now, and one for later. The best part was I didn\u2019t pay a dime! Since I have 2 cents in my bank account, and because I make about $130 a every two weeks, they had me fill out an insurance application, and now I will be covered by insurance for the visit. I can even go online to complete the insurance application and be insured for a longer amount of time!\n\nIt was a really great experience for me. Knowing that I can go there for some of my medical issues makes me feel empowered and in control of my finances and health.\n\nEdit: Wow! I just wanted to share my experience. I never expected this to make the front page! Like, this is my second post ever, that's crazy to me! Thanks for everyone who commented support and care. And thanks for everyone who reached out through DM. I've read a lot of reddit posts talking about how to care and treat yeast infections, and tons more talking about the services that Planned Parenthood offers. I wanted to give more validity to those great services and I think it's great that you all have shared home remedies that have worked for you! Now other people like me can come back to the comments on this post when they may not know what else to do.\nThanks Reddit!!","title":"I have a Yeast Infection, No Money, No Health Insurance, and I went to Planned Parenthood.

This doesn't include prescriptions. I decide to take all the available prophylactics because I don't know whether the person had anything or not. My HIV prophylactic alone was going to be several hundred dollars even after insurance (I ended up being able to use a coupon to cover my copay). However, my HIV meds are making me incredibly nauseated. So I pay to go to the doctor and they prescribe five days worth of anti-nausea meds (I'm on my other meds for 28 days, just fyi). I go to fill the prescription and insurance only approved two days. Two. I asked about the cash price for the meds and even the generic was going to be about $70 - just for the 5 days.

I didn\u2019t get my period yet this month so over the weekend I decided to take a pregnancy test and it turns out I\u2019m pregnant. I knew I was going to terminate the pregnancy immediately since I\u2019m in no position to care for a child at this point in my life. I called my boyfriend, my parents, and my best friend, and they were all supportive of my decision. After crying and getting over the shittiness of the situation, I made an appointment for a non surgical (medical) abortion. The appointment was for today, so this morning I called an Uber (I don\u2019t have a car on campus) and headed to the clinic which was an hour away. \n\nMy Uber driver seemed immediately uncomfortable and asked if we were going to a planned parenthood. I said no (which was the truth), we were just going to a doctors appointment. Still, he seemed uncomfortable. \u201cIs it an abortion clinic?\u201d The color drained from my face; how could he know? I just put the address of the doctor in, and there was nothing in the name that would imply it was an abortion clinic.  He stared at me, waiting for an answer, but I was too shocked to reply. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening, and now I was trapped in the car with this guy for the next hour. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to regret this decision for the rest of your life.\u201d He started telling me about the procedure, what it was like, telling me how horrible it was. \u201cThere\u2019s so much they don\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re making a mistake\u201d. He brought up his wife, who was 5 months pregnant, but trailed off. I just sat there in silence. We were driving through rural land, miles from any kind of house or storefront. I prayed he wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\n\nWe got about halfway there when he suddenly pulled over on the side of the road. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t take you any farther than this. You won\u2019t find another Uber out here. I can take you back if you want.\u201d I politely declined and got out of the car. I immediately started calling local taxi companies and asked if they could pick me up. My phone gave me a rough location which I gave them as my pickup address. My Uber driver waited around for about 15 minutes, assuming I\u2019d change my mind. I insisted I was fine and that he should go back and he eventually left. After waiting about 25 minutes, the cab showed up and I got to my appointment (an hour late).\n\nEven thinking about this experience brings tears to my eyes. I can\u2019t believe someone would be this cruel. An abortion is already traumatic enough, and not at all a decision I take lightly. That an older man would corner me and confront me about decisions that are none of his business are astounding. I contacted Uber and I can only pray they take appropriate action. \n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for your kind words! The thousands of internet hugs have made a huge difference. I reported him to Uber, and Uber got back to me and refunded the ride and said they were \u201creviewing his account\u201d. I hope to God he\u2019s fired. \n\nFor all the people who say I deserved this kind of treatment, I have nothing to say to you. I come from a politically conservative family, so I understand being pro life and disagreeing with my decision to terminate my pregnancy. However, the driver was aware of my decision to get an abortion within 10-15 minutes of picking me up from all his probing questions. If he wasn\u2019t comfortable driving me to the clinic, why continue to drive me there until we were stranded? Was it an impulsive decision to leave me by the side of the road, or was it premeditated after he understood our destination? He easily could have left me in my small city and I would have been able to get a different Uber driver and avoided the whole fiasco that ensued. Or, as others have pointed out, he could have simply declined the ride if the destination (and my decision to exercise my rights) were that offensive to him. \n\nI have no issue with him (or anyone else) having a different opinion or with him disagreeing with my choices. But your beliefs do not give you the right to make me feel uncomfortable when I\u2019m completely vulnerable and am relying on you to perform a service I desperately need. \n\nI\u2019m debating posting something in r\/legaladvice because I fear the possibility that this could happen again with another young woman (or man) who happened to be doing something or was about to engage in a behavior he personally deemed objectionable. Who else has he stranded, and who else will be stranded yet? \n\nIf there are further developments I will update all of you! Again, thank you so much for your kind words and encouragement. I had no idea my post would blow up like this and it makes me feel good knowing people of the internet have my back. You guys are awesome and this subreddit is amazing. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \n\nAlso: thank you kind Redditors for the gold, silver and platinum!! I will make sure this never happens to someone else again.\n\nUpdate 2: As I commented below, the reason my parents or boyfriend couldn\u2019t drive me is because they both live in North Carolina while I go to school in New York. My boyfriend couldn\u2019t afford to buy a last minute flight to see me, and because I live in a dorm room with a roommate, there would have been no place for him to stay. My parents did manage to get a last minute flight, but they didn\u2019t get one in time to take me to my appointment.

With my husbands history of head trauma, he was a boxer from 12 to 28, I was concerned. They sent an ambulance.\n\nThe paramedics evaluated him and told me something wasn't right. They decided to take him to the hospital. We've been there all night while my husband was getting scanned and tested. They did all kinds of tests involving memory, they used flashcards, and mental quizzes and puzzles.\n\nI'm in shock as to how bad my husband's mental state is. It's embarrassing I didn't notice how far he had declined. Maybe I didn't want to notice? Maybe it was a conscious decision? \n\nI watched him struggle name his hometown. He had lived there the first 22 years of his life. He couldn't do it. Mother's name, father's name. He struggled with answering the most basic questions.\n\nI had noticed in recent years he talked about the past less and less. He rarely tells stories about his past anymore. I didn't know that it was because he, basically, doesn't have a past anymore. All those pictures around the house hold no real meaning for him. He doesn't remember our first kiss, when he proposed to me, or very much about our wedding. He knows these things happened, but the specifics of those events are lost to him.\n\nA psychiatrist met with him, but she wasn't very helpful. She kept asking him about suicide. My husband isn't suicidal. She asked him misleading questions like she was trying to trick him into being suicidal. When I brought up how my husband hasn't bonded with our son she waved me off and told me she had rounds.\n\nThe neurologist is awesome. He really cares.\n\nMy husband's boss and some coworkers came this morning. They were more honest with me today than I think nthey have been in a long time. My husband hasn't been a trainer in 2 years. He used to go and get trained on all thye new JD technology and then train the other techs. It got to the point he couldn't do it anymore. He also has notebooks filled with notes and procedures he should know by heart. They're like his crutches so he can do his job. He rarely goes on field calls alone anymore, he usually takes someone with him. \n\nI met with a counselor that the neurology department employs to help patient's families deal with the fallout. She told me to prepare to take on more and more of the responsibilities around the house. It's a worry because my husband is the bread winner and I can't replace his income on my skills and education. She explained that patients with the trauma my husband has exist on routine. When something disrupts that routine, like a new baby, they often can't cope.\n\nMy husband is staying for a few more days. Tomorrow he meets with a different psychiatrist and then is being transferred to a more advanced neurology center 3 hours away. With a little luck I'll have a more definitive care plan and have him home by Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nTake care of your brain, kids.","title":"UPDATE: My husband is not bonding with our 5 week old son.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/9s563m\/update_my_husband_is_not_bonding_with_our_5_week\/","upvote_ratio":0.82,"over_18":false}

I repeated the \u201clife begins at conception\u201d line without really understanding it. Then I got married and started trying to get pregnant and I learned a lot more about how female reproduction works. \n\nI struggled with low fertility, so I began researching to see if there was anything I could do to improve our chances of conceiving. I learned that sometimes it\u2019s not a problem of getting the egg fertilized, it\u2019s a problem getting the fertilized egg to implant. I learned about \u201cfalse positives\u201d AKA chemical pregnancy when a fertilized egg (blastocyst) implants and begins to raise the pregnancy hormones, but then is shed in the following period. Normally a woman wouldn\u2019t even suspect that she had been briefly pregnant, but someone trying to conceive might catch it on an early response home pregnancy test. \n\nIn the middle of all of this new information that I was trying to absorb to figure out how to have a baby, I kept coming back to the \u201clife begins at conception\u201d line that I\u2019d been taught all my life. I decided that it must be wrong because if pregnancy doesn\u2019t begin at conception (there\u2019s an average of 6-12 days between conception and implantation which I had been previously unaware of), then life doesn\u2019t either. So I began opening my mind to birth control that prevents implantation and accepted that that was probably a reasonable way to allow women to have some control over their fertility. (This might sound obvious, and it should be, but for someone who believes that life begins at conception, preventing implantation is still ending that life, and I was taught that the birth control pill was just another form of abortion.)\n\nPraise the Lord, I finally got pregnant. Then a whole new nightmare awaited me. Pregnancy SUCKS!!!! In addition to the myriad physical discomforts, there\u2019s also the mental strain. Your body no longer feels like yours. Everything becomes about the baby. Everything you eat or don\u2019t eat (and how much!) revolves around what is best for the baby. Everything you do or don\u2019t do has to be evaluated in the context of what is best for the baby. Then there\u2019s the hormones. Besides the usual moodiness and volatility, I also suffered from pregnancy-related depression. I felt like a prisoner in my mind and body. \n\nThe only thing that got me through was thinking of this precious baby that I wanted so much and had worked so hard to get.  This brought me back to the abortion question. How inhumane is it to force this on another person who doesn\u2019t want it and doesn\u2019t intend to keep the baby! I\u2019d always heard it discussed as, \u201cDon\u2019t kill the baby! Just go through with it and give it up for adoption!\u201d As if carrying a baby to term is no big deal. \n\nI began to really question whether the real purpose was to punish the woman for getting pregnant in the first place, and it didn\u2019t take me long to decide that was definitely part of it. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t want a baby, she shouldn\u2019t have gotten pregnant in the first place.\u201d \u201cMaybe this will teach her to be more responsible.\u201detc.. (Disclaimer: I\u2019ve never personally known someone who got pregnant and wanted an abortion and was prevented from getting one, though I imagine that situation is about to become much more common. These are generic comments that I\u2019ve heard during discussions about abortion in general, rather than things I\u2019ve heard said about a specific person.)\n\nThat was all that it took to change my mind about early abortions. I have since had another baby and I kind of agree with some arguments I\u2019ve read that there is hardly any personhood or consciousness in a newborn baby. That doesn\u2019t mean that I support partial birth abortion, but I have moved my goalposts from \u201cokay in the first trimester\u201d to \u201cokay as long as the baby is not viable outside the womb\u201d. I still believe that life is precious, and I believe that if a pregnancy has progressed to the point of the baby being able to survive outside the womb, then there should be every effort made to allow it to live. [Edit to clarify that I still support having the baby removed if that\u2019s what the mother wants because it\u2019s her body, but a viable baby should be given medical care necessary to live the same as any other pre-term baby. I\u2019m sure this will be a relatively rare situation anyway.] What I no longer believe is that an unborn baby should have equal rights with its mother. An unborn baby is becoming a person, but it\u2019s not yet. Actual people who have already been born should be prioritized above a person-in-progress.\n\nHaving resolved the moral aspect of it for myself, I finally began to understand and be horrified by the ways that denying a woman an abortion could impact her mental health and education and relationships and career. It is inexcusable to me to allow this disproportionate punishment to the woman when she was not alone in conceiving the baby. Add onto that the horror of some people actually arguing against allowing abortions to rape victims, and I finally feel the rage that I\u2019ve seen in other pro-choice people. I finally understand. It\u2019s barbaric to deny women the *right* to choose what happens to *their own bodies*!\n\nTL\/DR: Unlike others I\u2019ve heard who say that becoming a parent made them support abortion less, becoming a parent took me from vehemently pro-life to extremely pro-choice.","title":"Becoming a mother changed my views on abortion","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/cud2yy\/becoming_a_mother_changed_my_views_on_abortion\/","upvote_ratio":0.78,"over_18":false}

So it took a while for me to write this update, but things have been going slow between us as well.\n\nAnd by slow, I mean in bed. Besides that, we had plenty of time to spend together and talk about practically everything that came to mind. I'm really happy I found someone that listens and has no fear of expressing himself.\n\nWe have decided to move forward in this adventure and even though it's a bit early we've decided to start a relationship. We thought that if we have the same feelings towards each other and since we're far from being teenagers it would be illogical to wait longer to make a decision.\n\nThat being said, as you may recall, my man had 0 experience with women, yet he told me he had a history of rejection since he was very young.\n\nThat has made him somewhat insecure and a bit fearful in sex matters.\n\nEvery time things escalated, his penis wouldn't become erect, but I made sure to tell him that it was ok and pretty much normal. So we did some other sexual things instead and still had fun. Sometimes even just cuddling was fine by me.\n\nOne day though, he had no trouble whatsoever, and I told him jokingly \"may I take a bit of advantage of you?\", and he answered \"yes, as much as you like\". \n\nSo I got on top of him and we finally did it! It was beautiful and sensual and we hugged and kissed for a while after it.\n\nHe's truly thankful for my patience and for treating him lovingly, but I just can't imagine another way of doing things.\n\nThank you all of you who have been asking about us or shared their own experience with me.\n\nI'm just thrilled and, after a lot of terrible experiences with men, happily in love.\n\n\nEdit: guys wtf, you're all so cute.

He did it in front of everyone at a busy gas station in Baltimore.\n\nWithout thinking, I jumped out of my car and screamed at the guy to get the fuck away from her unconscious body. He immediately tried to pick her up and apologize, but when I started to call the cops, he swung at me. Grazed my jaw.\n\nI got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to take video, but I couldn't while on the phone with the police. So I took as many pictures as I could.\n\nThis man dragged her body to his car, shook her awake, and made her come and tell me to stop calling the cops. I didn't. So, then, he tried to break into my passenger side door. I backed up to leave, so then he sat on the hood of my car. I managed to drive off without running him over (despite the desire).\n\nShocking, yes? But, wait, there's more. The majority of my call with 911 during the incident was arguing whether I was in Baltimore City or County. I lived in that neighborhood and knew it was in the city. Still, she transferred me to the county dispatch.\n\nCounty police arrived and said it was city. But was able to pull his license plate info to help me identify him. After about an hour, the city police arrived, took a report, told me that I need to file charges, and said he will check out the surveillance footage.\n\nI assumed that the state would pursue this incident automatically. I assumed my photos and the surveillance footage would be enough for the state to file charges related to assaulting his girlfriend, assaulting me, trying to break into my car, trying to intimidate me, etc. I assumed the evidence would be damning that I wouldn't have to do anything else. I assumed wrong.\n\nI had to file an assault charge. Me. I had to show up to court as the plaintiff. Me. I had to bring up to the prosecutor the fact that he was already on probation\/parole for a previous assault charge. Me. I had take 3 days off work for the district court hearing, the initial circuit court hearing, and the trial. Me. I was the sole witness because no surveillance footage was acquired (for reasons unknown). Me.\n\nToday was the trial. And, about 30 minutes ago, I got the call from the court that he was found guilty. He will be sentenced next Friday.\n\nI bring this all up not because I want to brag about how I put an abuser behind bars. (Ironically, my current job before I go off to law school is providing civil legal services to people who are incarcerated. And, I don't see jail or prison as the best option for many). I bring this up because I never truly understood what it meant for someone to press charges against an abuser. Until now.\n\nIt means navigating a system that is tragically overwhelmed and jaded. It means having one of the worst things that has happened to you be treated like a day at the DMV.\n\nGoing to court the first time, I had to wait in the hall alongside this man. The second time, I had to pass him twice in the hall to find out I was supposed to be across the street in a completely different building for victims and witnesses. No one told me this. The third time, I was waiting alone in the hall for my moment to testify while they were on break. And, he walked past me in the hall back into the court room.\n\nEach of those times, I felt myself reeling. The term revictimized had a more profound meaning. Not to mention how I had to endure being cross examined by his attorney, who was trying her hardest to make my story seem as if I was the instigator in my assault.\n\nThe thing is that I was not especially injured. I did not know this man. And, I feel confident that our paths will never cross again.\n\nBut, all I could do was imagine what this experience is like for victims of rape, domestic violence, or something else more violent and personal. The courage it takes to go through all this when the stakes are even higher is underappreciated. And, the reality of not wanting to file charges and not wanting to go through all this is overzealously criticized.\n\nTo all of you out there who have had to stand up and fight, I hear you and applaud you. And, I'm sorry you had to go through it, especially if you had to do it all alone. Having someone there to hold your hand makes all the difference.\n\nTo all of you out there who did not pursue action, I hear you too. I get why people don't report or take action. And, I'm sorry our system doesn't support you better.\n\nEdit: I'm overwhelmed with support here. Thank you! For some reason, I am not getting access to every single comment, which I am trying to read and respond to accordingly. I'm sorry to anyone I couldn't.\n\nFor those of you who have asked for a link or proof that this is the truth, I have two things to say to you:\n\n1. I understand wanting to get more information, but if your motivation is to verify my story (as some have overtly stated), you are part of the problem. Many victims don't report because of the fear of not being believed.\n\n2. I already feel that I have provided too much information that a reasonable person could do this on their own. In fact, I'm a little worried that this post has gotten so much attention that if someone were to find the offender's information from the case docket, they'd be harassed, which may result in further violence or harassment on my part or another.\n\nAny advice on this would be welcome, as he is not going to be incarcerated until his sentencing date.","title":"You just don't know until it happens to you","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/ccizyn\/you_just_dont_know_until_it_happens_to_you\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}

Random numbness, nerve pain (sometimes severe), exhaustion so severe I've had to quit my job, intense brain fog, vision problems leaving me at times unable to see in my right eye, tingling in my limbs, slurred speech to the point where I've been accused of being drunk, plus other strange and frightening things.\n\nI've seen around 4 different Doctors over the years about these issues. Every single time I would be diagnosed with anxiety and essentially felt as though I was considered a hysterical hypochondriac. At one point a Doctor told me the reason for all my symptoms was because 'driving makes some people anxious, and you drive nearly every day.' Yep. Apparently having immense pain in my back and neck, losing vision in my eye, slurring my speech, and everything else I've experienced is because I drive a car.\n\nThat was about 18 months ago. I went home feeling humiliated and stupid. I gave up and have never tried to get a diagnosis again.... Maybe I was just crazy. \n\nThat was until a couple of weeks ago when I woke up with completely numb feet. I wasn't scared though, I was used to it. I've dealt with this shit for years and this was just yet another instance of my body being weird. Hoping it would be gone by the next day I ignored it, only to wake up the day after to find that I had completely lost feeling from the chest down. \n\nI went to hospital where I stayed for over a week, and long story short I was diagnosed with a condition called transverse myelitis caused by an 'acute' Multiple Sclerosis flair up. \n\nThey did MRI scans on my brain and spine. Some of the many lesions I had were very old, which, according to the neurologist, means that I have likely had MS for years. \n\nAlthough once diagnosed with my kind of MS there's no way of entirely eliminating the chances of a relapse, there are treatments available and precautions one can take which mean that relapses are less likely to happen and less severe. Because I was undiagnosed and untreated for literally years and have had a severe relapse, I have been in a wheelchair since my diagnosis and I have no idea if I will ever be able to walk normally ever again. I am 27 and I am in a fucking wheelchair. I can't feel ANYTHING below my chest except nerve pain and constant, awful pins and needles. \n\nI've spoken to 2 male friends since my diagnosis. One with epilepsy, and one with MS. Both of my male friends, even the one with MS- who had almost identical symptoms to me, were referred to neurologists immediately. No 'you're anxious because you drive a car' bullshit. \n\nSo to any women out there being dismissed by health professionals as I was for fucking years- I feel you. I don't know what else to say except that I am heartbroken and furious that so many of us keep having to go through being labelled as essentially 'hysterical women' when we know we aren't. Not being believed is devastating when you can feel your brain and body failing. \n\nSorry this is poorly written. I actually have an English Degree but the MS has seemingly robbed me of the ability to think straight enough to write as well as everything else.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all SO MUCH for the support. I'm sitting here with tears in my eyes reading through everything. I know I will keep coming back to read these lovely comments when I have a bad day. I'm also so, so sorry to hear all these stories from other women- I feel so lucky that my illness is not life threatening.\n\nPlease don't worry about giving me any more awards :)\n\nFor those of you that don't believe me - thank you for proving my point. \n\nFinally - I was diagnosed less than 2 weeks ago. Please do not PM me asking if I think you or your loved one has MS or what advice I can give you. My heart really goes out to you but I really am in no position to advise.\n\nSending hugs \u2764\ufe0f","title":"My illness was misdiagnosed as anxiety for years.

I hastily excavated a tampon from my satchel and, lacking pockets, tucked it into my bra to prevent my coworkers from seeing it as I hustled to the bathroom.\n\nIt turned out to be a phantom leak, so all business proceeded as usual, and the tampon in my bra remained unused. Unfortunately, by the time I made my way back to my office, schmoozing with the occasional coworker on the way, I had entirely forgotten that it was there.\n\nAs the meeting time approached, I was feeling confident. I had done my research, assembled a glorious and stylish presentation with rock-solid data to support my argument, rehearsed my spiel, and psyched myself up with some assertive body language exercises. I had this. Immovable decision-makers, meet unstoppable go-getter.\n\nI strutted into the meeting ready to win the day. Distributing habitually firm handshakes to the white-haired businessmen around the conference table with a jaunty joke here and there, I made my way to the front of the room and started hooking my laptop up to the projector.\n\nTo my endless dismay, that was the moment my hidden tampon decided to make an appearance. It had slipped out of my bra, and I felt it graze my belly as it plummeted toward hem of my loose-fitting shirt.\n\nIf I had been thinking, I might have let it drop to the floor and kicked it under the table where it would have most likely gone unnoticed until the end of the meeting. But no such luck.\n\nInstead, I tried to catch it as it fell out of my shirt.\n\nAnd instead of catching it, I swatted it -- an impeccable under-hand serve that sent my tampon soaring, with all the grace of a badminton birdie, directly into the center of the oak conference table, where it landed with a loud *phlatt*.\n\nAll eyes in the room descended upon it as the smalltalk came to a record-scratching halt. Then all eyes turned upon me. A years-long silence followed in which I prayed for a sudden aneurysm.\n\nSuddenly remembering how to move, I lunged across the table and snatched it up.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic fit of charm, I grinned, raised the tampon up to the projection like a pointer, and said, \"Now that I have your undivided attention, let's get started.\"\n\nFortunately, that was enough to make one of them chuckle. Despite the deep discomfort on some of their faces, the laugh broke the spell and allowed me to proceed with the presentation.\n\nAnd all-in-all, the presentation went well, and I was approved for my redesign. So it could have been far worse.\n\nBut that won't stop my scumbag brain from kicking me with that particular memory every time I'm trying to fall asleep for the next month or so.\n\nTL;DR Silenced a room full of my company's old male executives by flopping my tampon on the conference table.\n\nEdit: The exec who laughed just popped into my office to ask what I'm planning to throw at them today. I'm never going to live this down.\n\nEdit 2: Holy maxi pads, Batman, that flying sanitary product got me gilded!

But what I can't understand is why some men feel the need to take advantage of crowds to feel up other people's bodies.\n\nThe first time I was inappropriately touched was in 8th grade.  \n\nIt was a really crowded bus as the middle school I went to was near other schools that happened to get out at the same time. The bus stopped at one of the main bus station so naturally, many people got off and there was a lot of bustling as half the bus fought their way to the door. I thought nothing of it until I felt someone's fingers roughly shove their way into my crotch from behind. By the time I had turned around, the person was lost in the wave of people getting off. I was literally the shyest I have ever been in my life at that time (was voted the shyest girl in the school that year actually) and so I never said anything to anyone.\n\nThe second time was on yet another crowded bus, a couple years into high school. This old Chinese man was holding onto my upper arm from behind which I was using to hold onto a strap above for balance and I thought it was a little weird but just assumed that he had nothing else to hold onto for balance so I shrugged it off as nothing. At least, until his hand reached down and started grasping at my right boob. Luckily, I was with my best friend this time who had gotten a hold of a seat and squeezed me in with her. The man got off at the next stop. We said nothing except for a few comments of disgust.\n\nThe third time, which happened a year later, didn't really involve me being touched sexually but was more creepy than anything. I was boarding a the bus with the same friend and as I stepped on, I could feel a guy pressed up close behind me. I thought this was very strange as the bus wasn't anywhere near crowded enough to justify that and the man kept this up as we got on until my friend and I were standing holding onto straps for support as we chatted. Now at this point the man had backed off a little, just enough that he was still there but not enough for anyone to go wtf at him. My friend and I were talking quietly about something about which stop to get off at, the man swaying with the bus to casually make contact with my back the whole time. Keep in mind this bus is not crowded by any means; my friend and I had chosen to stand because our stop was nearby. As we got off, the man made a remark, breaking into our conversation about something we were discussing. I later complained about this to another friend and halfway into describing the man, she quickly cut me off and finished the description for me. Apparently the man was hanging out near a mall next to a highschool and had been coming up to highschool girls and trying to give them his number. This was a young blond male in his 20s(?).\n\nA couple hours ago, I was riding the bus home from my old highschool where I was visiting a retiring teacher. It was an extremely crowded bus because the same line ran though at least a couple schools and a few stops away from where I was supposed to get off, I gave up my seat for an elderly man and started standing by the rear exit. Not a minute later, I felt fingers stroking my left butt cheek. I thought it was my imagination at first so I shrugged slightly away only to feel the fingers return. I was 100% sure those weren't some stray bag at that point; those were human fingers stroking from my lower to upper butt. \n\nI was done. I'd gained confidence in highschool thanks to mentioned teacher and I was sick and tired of being touched. I've gotten nothing but trouble from guys in college who just can't take a damn hint. I was called a bitch for not giving them a chance (I have a boyfriend) so I did what I felt was right. I called him out on it.\n\nI turned to him, looked the middle age blond man straight in those sky blue eyes of his and said in the loudest voice I could manage, \"Touch my butt one more time and I will report you.\" I knew I had the right man. He met my gaze unblinkingly and slowly nodded. No one seemed to have paid attention or cared. But at that moment, I was relieved.\n\nWhen I got off, I found out that my sister was on the same bus and had squeezed onto the front of the bus. If she had gotten on the back door, my little sister could have been in my position instead. She could have been the one touched instead of me. And I know she wouldn't have said a thing.\n\nI know this isn't a big deal to many people but I had to get it out somewhere. Thank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR Guy kept stroking my butt, I called him out on it, and my little sister could have been his victim instead of me if she had gotten on the back door instead of front.\n\nEdit: Ahh thank you! I honestly only expected a few upvotes and a comment or two perhaps so I was honestly surprised when I came back... And only one nasty PM to boot! Thank you so much! \n\nEdit 2: Holy...thank you for the gold! I had to refresh twice because I couldn't believe my eyes... Thank you!\n\nEdit 3: To those wondering, seeing something like this happen and speaking up to either the culprit or just getting attention to that happening would be amazing. Silence is not golden in this case.","title":"I finally called a man out on the bus for touching me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/6cxzvv\/i_finally_called_a_man_out_on_the_bus_for\/","upvote_ratio":0.68,"over_18":false}

I went on the board to my state and on the front page I saw one of my sister\u2019s friends, a girl I have known since she was 10 and I know would never post something like that publicly. Her name and face was included in all pics with men requesting more from whatever asshole was sharing them. I went to my local college page and after going through a 2 pages I saw 3 girls I recognized. I had to stop after that because I felt nauseous.\n\nThe posts include both location and names as well, incredibly personally identifying information that sometimes had a social media handle. There are town specific threads. All the posts were of women, there were posts requesting women, even of mothers and married women.\n\nWomen need to stop sharing nudes, even if you don\u2019t include your face in them they will still post a picture of your face above them in their sick threads. No matter how a guy tries to convince or manipulate you into sending them, even if it\u2019s on Snapchat, do not send them. You have no idea if you will end up on a website like this no matter what you think of the guy you\u2019re sending it to.\n\nI\u2019m not going to post the website, it\u2019s been scrubbed but mirror sites of it are still active. I also don\u2019t want any men who lurk here to know of it. There is a petition going around to have the website taken down permanently and there are legal actions you can take if you find yourself on the website. Stay safe out there.\n\nEdit: Someone PM\u2019d me and confirmed there have been cases of minors being posted on there too\n\nEdit 2: Receiving a lot of pms and comments about my use of the word \u201cmen\u201d in the title. I find the fact that\u2019s what you have the biggest grievance with in this entire post very telling\n\nEdit 3: Had to remove the petition link to follow sub rules!\n\nEdit 4: I don\u2019t know how but site owners have started catching on to how people are talking about their creepy sites. Two of the mirrors I know are down for maintenance and \u201cmembers only\u201d and one is also trapped behind a paywall even though 1 hour ago they were open for anyone to see. Looks like they are trying to lock down their operation before the movement against it gets too much traction\n\nEdit 5: To all the concerned women messaging me, I will be answering all of your PMs. Some of the women who did message me have found their pics on the sites before they were locked out by the site owners. In light of this, I am still sharing the links with users I can verify are women (I will NOT be sharing with any men) for you to have in case they do open the sites back up. Please PM me if you would still like the links and I\u2019ll send you instructions on what I need to verify you are a women and how I will send these links to you. For now I\u2019m taking a break from answering PMs but I will get back to everyone today or tomorrrow.\n\nEdit 6: I promise this is the last edit to this post. I have gotten over 500 messages so far and I will respond to all of them! It might take me a while to respond however. The only thing is I seem to have hit some sort of chat limit and now I\u2019m unable to respond to anymore chats people send me today. PMs are still working but I am just going to post the instructions on my profile and pin it so you don\u2019t need to go through the chat feature to reach me. I will still be vetting obviously. I am also planning on compiling a guide from suggestions in the comments of what to do if you find your pic on one of these sites and will work on it this week and send it to those who PM\u2019d me. Lastly, I just want to thank the incredible women who have shared their stories and worries with me over their pictures appearing on one of these sites. The sheer amount women who have this anxiety is staggering, I just want to say in all likelihood you aren\u2019t on these sites, but even if you are it\u2019s not a reflection on you. It\u2019s a reflection on the sick fucks who could betray someone\u2019s trust so flippantly, and I hope they rot in hell. I also hope everyone pushes your local politicians on revenge porn laws so that women don\u2019t have to suffer the anxiety and ramifications of having their nude images shared without consent online. I hope all of you stay safe.","title":"Never share your nudes with anyone, men are putting them up on websites sorted by location and by college, even including names","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/hyrjwp\/never_share_your_nudes_with_anyone_men_are\/","upvote_ratio":0.77,"over_18":false}

He\u2019s signed up with at least 4 dating sites. I woke up this morning with eyes so puffy they were almost swollen shut. Then I realized that I don\u2019t have to put up with his constantly shitty mood anymore. I don\u2019t have to do all the emotional labor. I don\u2019t have to do jack shit for him. I feel absolutely nothing for him and all of his sobbing and snot and apologies. There is just this huge void where are my love and caring for him used to be.\nI feel SO free.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is just relief or dissociation, though. So I\u2019m gonna join a gym, eat healthy, buy some new panties and upgrade my ancient hitachi magic wand.

Thank you all so much!\n\nTo touch on a few common questions, he\u2019s slept on a recliner for two days. As much as I\u2019d like to throw him out and serve him with divorce papers today, I really have to be cautious for now so that he\u2019ll continue to be cooperative. I am 100% sure we\u2019ll be divorced, though. I\u2019m looking into therapy for myself and my two kids and contact a lawyer ASAP. I have no intention of dating anyone until all of this is over and I\u2019ve had a shit ton of therapy.\n\nFor the handful of people who cared about his reasoning (and I sure as fuck don\u2019t) he said he felt old and fat. He hates himself and any attention he got from these women was an ego boost. Every time we talk now he cries.  He sobs and I feel just completely emptiness in the part of me that used to care. I suspect maybe it has something to do with his diabetes, super low testosterone, and ED. But again, not my problem.\n\nI bought the cute undies and Satisfyer 2 Pro plus. I\u2019m looking into the other vibes mentioned. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m gonna have the best sex of my life with myself soon!\n\nEdit 2: The comment about the testosterone really upset a couple guys. I never shamed him about his health problems, if anything I was too accommodating. So I\u2019ll give you an example of how exhausting the relationship was. He never gave himself the shots. Whatever, some people don\u2019t like needles. I\u2019d give him the shot then he\u2019d be cranky with me for the rest of the night because his leg hurt. He\u2019d say I did it wrong this time. I was the one setting a reminder on my phone for every two weeks. We\u2019d run out of syringes, he wouldn\u2019t buy more. I\u2019d mention it, he\u2019d ignore me. His medicine would expire, I\u2019d mention it, and he wouldn\u2019t go to the doctor for a refill. On and on, over and over. He wouldn\u2019t let me give him the shot unless he felt absolutely terrible. Now imagine the situation I mentioned repeating in every other facet of our lives. He wasn\u2019t always like this. But this is who he is now.\n\nEdit 3: I\u2019m going to make an appointment for an STD check. Ugh.\nThe only reason I found out is because he gave me his phone to charge. It was sitting right next to my tablet in my field of vision when a message popped up. It said something about \u201cgetting chills thinking about our meeting.\u201d I thought it was spam. But then a minute later, \u201care you still there?\u201d So I asked him and he said he didn\u2019t know. He looked at it for a minute and handed the phone back to me to charge it. I saw that he had deleted the messages. Then I just knew. So I logged into our cellphone account and saw 189 messages between them from that night. He finally admitted it. I guess he had just talked to her that night but he\u2019s apparently been trying to cheat with women online for 4-5 weeks.","title":"I caught my worthless husband cheating and I feel great","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/nppdaq\/i_caught_my_worthless_husband_cheating_and_i_feel\/","upvote_ratio":0.84,"over_18":false}

He was a bit annoyed cause it was right there, but agreed cause all he had to do was make a phone call and he could do that at the same time. \n\nHe's walking several paces behind me cause he's on an important phone call. We didn't look like we were walking together. \n\nNow I will say for shows, I like to dress up a little. Maybe a torn up shirt and thick leggings with boots. 2 guys came walking down the side walk from the other direction, and split so I was in the middle. \n\n\"Hey baby, I like your outfit.\" \"Where you going, you look sexy as fuck.\" I felt one of their fingers actually reach out and touch my waist through one of the tears in my shirt. \n\nI kept eyes forward, mouth closed, and kept walking. \"Fine, fuck you, bitch.\" As they kept walking the other way. \n\nMy band mate came up next to me (having ended his call.)

She left my dad when I was 7 and let him have custody of us due to her being unable to take care of us. She never asked for anything from him except her freedom. For years he told us she didn\u2019t love us, and how horrible a person she was. She never contacted us, at least that's what he told us so we believed him. Turns out, he gave her a bunch of ridiculous rules about being in contact with us, and because she felt so much guilt about leaving us and him raising us on his own, she wanted to respect his boundaries and rules. She emailed us many times, but he never told us about any of them (one of the rules my dad had was as long as we were minors, all contact had to be through him, she showed me the emails she sent to us through him). When I turned 18, she got in contact with me directly, and we started talking. I went to visit her and, after many long conversations, I moved in with her and her husband two months ago.\n\nI went from a child believing my mom didn\u2019t love me to being an adult who now understands that my father actually let me believe that because to him, his feelings were more important than mine. I'm so angry at him because he caused actual emotional and mental harm to my brother and myself by telling us our mom didn't love us. She didn't chose him, so he told us she didn't want us. He was unable to separate his relationship with her from our relationship with her as her children. He thought that the best revenge on her was to make us not love her, because he never stopped to realize that it was his children who were the ones who actually paid the price for his lies. We still loved her, we just hated ourselves.\n\nI know he did his best. He made sure we always had a roof over our head and food in our belly; we went on vacations, never lacked for a lot, monetarily. But he still let us believe that our own mother didn't love us because she was brain damaged and mentally ill, and she wasn't capable of taking care of us financially. She believed giving him full custody was in our best interest even if it broke her heart. She didn't want us to feel like we had to choose between the two of them.\n\nI don't use reddit regularly, but I've been so happy lately about the whole situation that I needed someplace to gush. If I don't come back for a while, I do apologize. I don't care about fake internet points or karma because my mom really fucking loves me!!!!

At my old high school, (I'm now 44) A special needs girl was violently raped in one of the bathrooms. This was back in 2021. NOTHING has been done, we don't even know the identity of the perpetrator. Administrators and law enforcement are refusing to press charges and are actively trying to cover it up. The perpetrator is still enrolled and attending the school every day. We held a protest last Friday and we're trying desperately to bring some awareness to this situation. This is not the only instance of a special needs girl being raped at this school and nothing is being done about it. I was able to meet and talk with \"Janie\". She's 19 years old but her mental capacity is that of a 5 or 6 year old. She's such a precious soul and my heart breaks for her and her family. We need all the help we can get sharing this story.

I didn't tell anyone because I was too scared of being outed. My parents definitely would have kicked me out.\n\nTwo months later, I found out I was pregnant. I didn't know anything about abortion except that it was murder. I didn't have health insurance, and it's not exactly easy to get one as a minor anyways. I was too scared to talk to my parents about it. So I went to the internet to figure out how to force a miscarriage. It took several attempts, and I'll spare the details, but I woke up to a bloody mess that still haunts me.\n\nThat pastor is still at my family's church, preaching to vulnerable kids, claiming God loves them, that abortion is wrong, and that i would have deserved to go to hell. I haven't been back since I turned 18, but I still feel extremely guilty about the possibility he's abused anyone else.\n\nI'm now a PhD student in a stem field. I don't think this would have happened if I was forced to have my rapist's child.\n\nNow that RBG is gone, and Amy Coney Barrett is up to replace her, I'm terrified for other people who would have to go through what I went through to get abortions in times of crisis. I feel so hopeless. But I'm going to keep fighting because that's the legacy RBG left behind.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the love and support <3 To everyone telling me to report, please stop. There was another scientist recently who spoke out about her sexual assault during another Supreme Court justice's hearing that did not stop him from being appointed. Reporting, especially years later, rarely, if ever, helps the survivor. And may not keep the perpetrator from remaining in a position of power\n\nEdit 2: I honestly didn't think this would get so much attention. I have been in a bad place lately with everything going on in the world, and just wanted to vent. Even in anonymity, the comments suggesting I'm lying, making this up, trolling, or responsible for my perpetrator's actions because I never reported are starting to get to me. I'll leave this up because I think the discussions are important to have, but please please PLEASE stop dm-img me disgusting messages, leaving vulgar comments, asking me for personal information\/proof, or blaming me for what someone else did.\n\nEdit 3: I will be turning off my messages and chat requests and likely not responding further to other conversations. I appreciate the overwhelming support and the people telling me their experiences, but at the moment, receiving hateful dm's, demands of proof, pointing out supposed holes in my story, or being called a murderer\/enabler is just not something I'm equipped to handle. I chose to remain anonymous, and I don't want to give every detail of my life and have my identity revealed.

Beating up the masked rapist who pulled the pretty lady into the bushes, who will in turn be forever grateful and fall in love with you. Chasing off the robber who wanted to steal the nice grandma's handbag. Many versions of saving the damsel in distress. It's natural to want to see yourself like that. It's pretty cool to be the hero.\n\nWhen in reality \"making women feel safe in public\" is something different 9,5 out of 10 times. It's being \"no fun\" and calling out your male buddies or other men who make misogynist jokes or make women uncomfortable. It's \"cockblocking\" a buddy who wants to take home a drunk girl. It's not hitting on women when it is inappropriate no matter how pretty you find them and how blue your balls are. It's making sure a female friend gets home safely. It's meddling. It's being a nag. Ultimately it's confronting and risking to anger or annoy other men, especially men you like or are friends with and sometimes sacrificing that friendship. It costs something. And it is not rewarded with women being so grateful they reward you with sex.

This was my survival instinct kicking in.\n\nAs my husband dragged me in a headlock through the parking lot towards our car, I struggled to escape his grasp, hoping someone would notice and care. \n\nYou noticed, and more importantly, you cared enough to do something.\n\nMy husband is a large intimidating man. You are an average, somewhat timid looking man. As you held the hand of your little son, it must have crossed your mind that intervening could be dangerous and would certainly be uncomfortable. \n\n\"Hey! You can't do that dude\". \n\nYour voice stopped not only my husband in his tracks, but several other nearby patrons. My hope of rescue began to build.\n\n\"Fuck off bro, this is my wife\".\n\nMy husband quickened his pace. The car was 15 feet away. Fear sunk back into my heart. \n\n\"I don't care who she is, you can't do that.\"\n\nMy husband was extremely irritated at you. Perhaps even considering assaulting you. But then he started to feel the spotlight that was falling on him. More patrons were paying attention, some in their cars rolling down their window, some stopping in the parking lot to assess the situation.\n\nIt was enough. It was all I needed. My husband let go of me, got in the car and was gone. You went on with your day, surely unaware of the impact you just made on my life. \n\nWhat you didn't know is that I'd been trapped in the abusive relationship for years and that my husband had become absolutely unhinged in the last couple of days, showing levels of violence and anger I'd never seen in him.\n\nWhat you didn't know is that for the previous 32 hours he had kept me from my phone, my computer, my car, and any contact with anyone.\n\nThe only reason he risked taking me in public was because the income tax return was in my name and he wanted me to cash it for him. I honestly expected him to kill me afterwards.\n\nMinutes after you saved my life, I borrowed another stranger's phone and called the police and my mother. \n\nFinally, I am free. \n\nThank you, stranger.\n\nEdit: Wow. And thank you to all of you kind strangers! I can't begin to explain what all of these supportive comments and private message mean to me. I hear your kind advice and it is so very much appreciated. I feel so much stronger now and ready to do this!!\n\nAs for the hateful messages I'm getting, you can't bring me down. Yes, I realize I screwed up by staying all those years but the important thing is I'm out now.

I wanted to share it in hopes for a laugh and maybe to be a little cute. I didn't expect how many men were actually going to explain to me why seagulls were called seagulls though. Holy fuck.

I have never told most people about this and I want to get the word out to other women about how easily this can happen, how quickly you can be caught off guard, and how even safe places can have predators. \n\nIt was terrifyingly similar to the actual movie Taken, but it happened in Austin, Tx. There is a very popular bar district downtown here, it's like a strip and super busy with college kids. I was 21 years old and I was out with my husband and 4 of his friends (all guys). So it was me and 5 decent sized men and this still happened. \n\nWe were all out drinking and having a great time. I had stopped on the busy street in front of one of the bars to talk to a door guy I knew, and my husband and the guys walked off in front of me. I had just said bye to the door guy and I was trailing behind the guys by about 15 feet. I was noticeably drunk, I was stumbling a bit. I'm a small woman, 90 lbs. Suddenly a car pulls over next to me and rolls down the window, it's a charismatic and good-looking guy in his 20s. He goes \"Hey! I'm your uber! Get in\" and unlocks the door. I looked over and felt ever-so-slightly off and went \"No, I didn't call an uber\" and kept walking. The car started rolling along next to me and the guy is saying through the window \"No you didn't call, your friend called. We're here to pick you up. Get in.\" And I stopped walking, for the slightest second, and glanced to the car with a funny face. By that point I knew it was weird. It was already happening so fast, maybe 20 seconds went by so far. As soon as my eyes landed on the car, the driver turned to the backseat and said something fast in another language. The backdoor flies open and there are 2 other guys sitting there, about his same age, and they are all eastern-european (maybe greek?) with accents.  My eyes went wide and the guys lunged forward, grabbed me by the waist and yanked me into the car. I was gone and in the car in under a second. I screamed in the loudest, most blood curdling way I could muster, NOOOOOOOO. My husband's best friend about 15 feet ahead hears me first, stops dead in his tracks and starts bolting towards me. The driver starts driving right away and the guys in the back try slamming the door behind me.\n\nThey had my wrists but I stuck my leg between the car and the door right before he tried to slam it, so it bounced off my leg and my husband's best friend grabs the door. Then they  pulled my leg in and were able to shut the door and lock it. \n\nI'm screaming, they're driving away. The rest of my group is running to us, the bouncer we were in front of comes running to me, and him and husband's best friend run after the car a few feet and yank me out of the still open window by my arms, while the car is still moving.  I'm still screaming and kicking. On my way out of the car I kick the driver in the chest. They sped away, turned and were gone.\n\nI'm crying. My husband is crying. The bouncer calls the police to report it. It's a whole scene. I left immediately, I rushed home in a panic and didn't stay around for the report. Don't know if anything ever happened with it. I never gave them my information. I was honestly so traumatized and in a state of shock that I never did anything or told anyone else. My friends that were with me (and my husband primarily) struggled with tremendous guilt for a long time. Nobody felt like they reacted fast enough, or harsh enough, or just that they let me lag behind at all. It changed all of us forever and I'm still terrified of being anywhere alone and of being taken. \n\nI was 21 and I was basically kidnapped. There were a few seconds I was completely locked in the car and they were driving off, holding me tightly and restraining my limbs. They were talking a foreign language and I knew in that moment 100% that I would be trafficked and thought it would be the last time I ever saw my husband or my friends. \n\nIt was a perfectly normal night in a well-lit, busy, decent area of town and I was with a group of men who would've protected me. And they pounced on me immediately because they thought I was alone. \n\nBe extremely wary of cab drivers and people claiming they are uber and lyft when you are out. Always confirm on the app that someone is your driver, and never stand too close to cars when you are on the sidewalk. I know that last one may seem paranoid, but if you are in a vulnerable position (I was drunk, dressed sexy, seemingly alone outside of a club), you need to be extremely wary of your surroundings and how quickly the unexpected can happen. \n\nPlease be careful. Please be safe. Please report anything suspicious. Be vigilant.

And as it\u2019s hot at the moment and he doesn\u2019t change his underwear daily, he kind of smells? I don\u2019t like it and my second eldest said the smell of her dads feet makes her feel sick. I\u2019ve asked him if he would at least use deoderant, but he yelled at me saying it was \u201cgay\u201d. He\u2019s now gone out for his fortnightly fishing weekend with the lads where they drink beers and watch football. He also demands nightly sex but never does any foreplay and refuses to do oral. I am slightly upset at how I am treated, but my mother says this is just the reality of being married and having children. Am I being unfair? How can I make things better for us?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve seen so many variations of this and my response is always WHY ARE YOU MARRIED TO THIS MANCHILD?! At best, he is useless, at worst he is an actual menace to the household. Come on ladies, know your worth, stop enabling this crappy behaviour and stop marrying these pathetic creatures. Stop having kids with them. And if you\u2019ve already got kids with them, leave him, get child support and hire someone to do the household  jobs he should be doing.\n\nIf I see one more post about men who don\u2019t do chores, look after their kids, and don\u2019t know basic hygiene, I think I might have to start hunting them for sport.\n\nI find it genuinely disappointing that so many women think they have to put up with this. You don\u2019t! Leave. Him. Better yet, don\u2019t marry him! Find someone else who\u2019s not a complete tool.\n\nedited to add: The guys messaging me saying I hate men and they feel sorry for my partner, you\u2019re telling on yourselves bubs! Keep your unwashed ass out of my DMs Kevin.","title":"I\u2019m so sick of reading posts about bad husbands (RANT)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/olevw3\/im_so_sick_of_reading_posts_about_bad_husbands\/","upvote_ratio":0.75,"over_18":false}

A few stops into the ride, a drunk construction worker barged his way into where we were sitting and threw down his bag of tools and a 6 pack. He started talking to her calling her pretty and trying to convince her that she was hot enough to be a model. I'm somewhat drunk too and none of their conversation with worth my attention. I didn't bat an eye until he commented on her short her skirt was. I muted Netflix and watched her face go from nervous maybe flattered to a little uneasy. While I thought to myself about how inappropriate that comment was, his hand ended up on her knee and her facial expression just dropped. I looked down to see that his finger nails were just under the skirt and recognized what was about to happen. I offered the guy $20 for a beer and he removed his hand and got me a beer. He didn't take the money, but the girl didn't move and stayed put. He went back to talk to her. From reading the threads on here, I recognized that this girl was frozen. So I needed to keep his attention and figured the best way to do it was to ask him what his trade was. He responded and said he's a fireproofer. As he turned back to her, I just blurted out \"Unions suck\". He was not happy about that comment, but I was happy because for the next 15 minutes, his attention was focused on me. Why that girl didn't move for the rest of the train ride, I'll never know, but I knew I did the right thing because she thanked me on her way off the train.\n\nI learned something last night.

To go to my OBGYN clinic to see a provider that can perform the procedure, I need a referral from my primary care clinic, which should not be a big deal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis morning I went to my appointment to get my referral and encountered a jerk of a doctor. He interrupted me several times as I tried to explain the reason for my visit and I had to correct him several times as he kept referring to my arm implant as an IUD, which is completely the wrong type of implant. He insisted that in order to get a referral I would have to get a pelvic ultrasound. I've had an arm implant removed before and didn't need a pelvic ultrasound previously, which I tried to explain to the doctor but he interrupted again to say that it's requirement and I wouldn't get a referral without one.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nTrying to contain my rising frustration, I looked him straight in the eye and said \"No\". I explained once again that I have an arm implant and don't meet any criteria for a pelvic ultrasound. He tried to say that it was a general requirement so I had him pull up the criteria to go through it. Some of the criteria included diagnosed endometrial conditions, fibroids, abnormal bleeding, presence of an IUD, etc. None of which apply to me. After going through the criteria, the doctor was quiet for a second and said the OBGYN clinic would contact me to set up an appointment for an arm implant removal. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was a frustrating experience for sure, but I am happy that I stuck up for myself and told a doctor \"no\". 18 year old me would have been too intimidated to speak up but thanks to others for talking about being their own advocate, like on this sub, I have learned a lot in taking control of my own medical care.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTldr: A doctor said I needed to get an unnecessary procedure and I said no\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: for some common questions, 1) my insurance requires a referral for OBGYN & 2) I will be reporting this provider","title":"A doctor tried to make me get an unnecessary procedure and I told him no","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/mm1qud\/a_doctor_tried_to_make_me_get_an_unnecessary\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

Sometimes for conferences etc., but often also for supervising projects, fieldwork and advisory work, where I stay in the specific place for usually one to three weeks. I am fine with that and like travelling. These trips often take me to places in Africa and the Middle East, so you might imagine where this is going. Another important information is that the institution that employs me pays me pretty well, but is basically Scrooge McDuck when it comes to travel expenses. One consequence of this is that they want us to take public transport (train, bus, subway\u2026) on business trips whenever possible instead of taxis or ubers because it is cheaper and whenever we want to be reimbursed for a taxi ride we need to provide a detailed explanation why that ride was necessary and could not be done via public transport. Annoying but I also never had any problems with it until now.\n\nI just had a pretty big fight with the person working on my travel expense claim for a one week trip to Cairo, Egypt, at the end of last year (so pre-Corona-mess and yes, they are working really slowly right now). Usually a very nice woman handles them and there have never been any problems, but this time I got a call by a new guy, who had been put in charge of it:\n\n\u201cI am calling about your travel expense claim for Cairo from last year? There is a problem with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, how can I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt says here you took taxis for pretty much every ride there; you know that we don\u2019t reimburse that, right? And as an explanation you just wrote \u201cpublic safety\u201d?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cairo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever been to Cairo?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026no\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not going to take the public bus or subway in Cairo as a 30-year old, visibly European woman travelling alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I value my life, health and safety and I prefer to do my job without getting molested.\u201d\n\n*Cue a monologue by that guy in which he makes pretty clear that he thinks I am an unreasonable, spoiled, hysterical woman and me getting more and more pissed and asking for his supervisor during it. Until in one of my by now pretty loud answers I say the following:*\n\n\u201cDo you really expect me to carry my work-laptop and all the cash (which is a lot, especially by Egyptian standards) I need to pay for the workers and materials in my handbag on a damn bus in Cairo during rush hour?!\u201d\n\nAnd suddenly he was quiet. It turns out that the fact that I was carrying a laptop and cash was a totally reasonable explanation to take a taxi for him. My safety was not. He made pretty clear that if hadn\u2019t been carrying the laptop or cash my request would have been denied as unreasonable.\n\nFun fact in the end: Taxi rides are dirt cheap in Cairo. Taking them instead of public transport cost around 50$ more, if even that much. That is the amount of money my employer is obviously willing to put me in danger for. Good to know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: Before anyone gets upset: I would have been able to pay for the taxi rides myself, sure. This wasn't about the 50$ for me. It was about the principle and my employer disregarding my safety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Woah!

It has been a long since I could. I was so excited. Had everything packed- even meal prepped food for dinner so it was easy to warm up if we had a few too many. Well.... he did. And it got ugly. \n\nI fell asleep in my hammock around 3. We had a plan- make dinner at 5, then go get more wood bc we were almost out. When I laid down he said he was going to forage for dead wood.  Great. \n\nI wake up at 5 and there's this HUUUGE fire he built. All proud with a puffed up chest he's like,  \"see all I gathered?\" I look at the ground and there's nothing. I ask if everything on the fire is what he found and he says yes.  Wtf? I tell him I can't put a grate over that (3 feet high with logs that hang over the side with 12 foot flames) and he LOSES IT. \n\nDecides to leave, angry.  Only thing I said was \"who does this?!\" as he's busy tearing up the tent to get his shit. He dumps the one cooler he owned onto the ground and straight up LEFT ME THERE.  No car,  no light (he took them out of malicious intent) and my phone was dead on a non electric site. It was getting dark so I had to scurry and get the food I could fit into my cooler before the animals came out. Jar of pickles shattered.  Put the dry food (bread,  chips, etc) into my tent.  Dark came quickly.\n\nI was surrounded until dawn by a dozen raccoons and they weren't playing.  Standing on their back legs,  hissing at me,  lunging for my feet.  I ended up back to a tree fighting those fuckers all night with a stick on fire. There are bears in those woods and that's my biggest phobia. I was terrified. Crying and panicking,  I heard a growl in the woods.  I just stood there frozen,  I was so damn scared ya'll. \n\nThis son of a cunt tried to show up at 7am the next day telling me,  \"if you apologize for the mean way you treated me I'll take you home. \"  BITCH NOW THAT THE DAY BROKE YOU WANNA HELP?! I told that bastard to kick rocks and waited for my mom to come around noon.  I left the site with 2 days paid still on it. Wasnt going to fight those fucks again. And fuck that bear I heard. \n\nI have completely cut contact with him but he owes me money.  I do have a bunch of his expensive disc golf bullshit that he left here- which he's not getting until he pays me back. Petty or not,  I spent like 600 bucks on everything to do with this trip and he paid zero bc he lost his job. I was just trying to do something nice for him bc I badly wanted to go. Instead I get left in the dark with no communication device, no light, and have to fight off wild animals. No asshole, you can't come sweeping in and fix it. This will never be fixable. \n\nSorry for the rant but I didn't know where else to post this.  fuck that dude.\n\n\nEdit: I've called the police on him and his officer.\n\nEdit 2: got a rabies shot just a few hours ago.  I seem to be just fine. Thank you so for the awards, I'm a bit overwhelmed by all of the replies,  but im trying to get to everyone and I sincerely appreciate all of your kind words.

He used it all up. Claimed he accidentally spilt it in the shower. He told me he would replace it. This was 6 months ago. He does small loads of laundry rather than waiting for a large load and uses waaaay too much detergent, beads and dryer sheets. He eats all my snacks. He drinks all my bottled water and tea. Never buys any to replace them. \n\nI guess I was specifically set off today because he told me he would buy me 5 cases of water to replace all the water he\u2019s been drinking. I know, it\u2019s just water but I also drink a lot and having to buy new cases constantly adds up. So, we go to the store. I told him he doesn\u2019t have to buy 5 and 2 will do. He insists on buying 5 so I\u2019m like okay. I get my own stuff and at checkout I had to use the restroom so I gave him my card to get my stuff. What does he do? He charges it all on my card rather than just my portion. It was $15 worth of water. I\u2019m so annoyed cause that is a lot of money to me. I only got the 5 cases cause he was supposed to pay for it. \n\nTo add, I bought a thing of Oreos. It was Pok\u00e9mon Oreos. When he got to checkout, I wasn\u2019t there cause I was in the bathroom but apparently the cashier told him to watch out for a particular character on the Oreos cause that Oreo would sell for $8,000 online since it\u2019s so rare. He was super excited about it and decided to go and buy the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon Oreos on the shelf which was 6 more bags. For the small chance of getting that rare Oreo. But he couldn\u2019t buy my water. He claimed he just forgot.  But he ALWAYS \u201cforgets\u201d when it comes to buying stuff for my house that he uses a lot of. \n\nNow he\u2019s talking about buying a $1,200 phone at full price. So I know it\u2019s not cause he doesn\u2019t have money for it. \n\nAm I wrong to be upset about all of this? It seems petty and small but it\u2019s frustrating for me. I guess I could just use some advice.\n\nEdit: I did confront him about the water in the car. He said \u201cI forgot. Damn I can\u2019t do anything right.\u201d Then, I wrote this. We just got back to my house. He laid out all the fucking Oreo bags on the table and said \u201cwhich one should I open first?\u201d I said \u201cwhy can you spend $24 on Oreos but you couldn\u2019t buy my water?\u201d He said he was sorry and turned the subject into something sexual. I, obviously annoyed, ignored him. He then put his headphones in and started jamming to music. I waited a few minutes and blew up on him. He told me he would buy all the stuff I\u2019ve been asking him to buy over the past few weeks when he gets paid cause it adds up to $100 and he \u201chas never spent that much in a day.\u201d He just bought a $100 hoodie last week. Lie. I confronted him with that. He said he would buy the grocery related stuff right now and would buy my shower gel and laundry stuff when he got paid. He just left to buy the grocery related stuff. I doubt he\u2019s going to buy the other stuff without me having to ask him again. I appreciate everyone\u2019s responses and I\u2019m seriously rethinking our relationship.\n\nEdit 2: I got the \u201crare\u201d Oreo in my bag and I ate it in front of him. It\u2019s not that rare lol. I think I crushed his soul when I showed him the posts on eBay.\n\nEdit 3: I am getting a lot of comments about why I buy so much bottled water. Unsafe drinking water. I always feel sick when I drink the tap water even when it\u2019s filtered. Don\u2019t worry, I recycle. And once again, thank you so much to all the supportive comments. I really appreciate everyone\u2019s perspective.","title":"My boyfriend doesn\u2019t live with me but he spends 5 out of 7 days of the week at my house.

We're looking at lawsuits and ( **EDIT: Have been made aware I was confusing this part with the Abolition Abortion bill, it is correct jail time is not on the table yet with SB8**) ladies, nothing about the men here, except they can sue us for this as well; I guess telling us what to do with our bodies isn't enough! Texas is even pushing for bills that go as far as to give a woman the death penalty for an illegal abortion, but this has not passed *yet*.\n\n\nSeriously though, with the Republican majority in the Surpreme Court and this being passed in Texas, they soon will try even harder to put more restrictions on birth control and things like plan b. If you want to avoid the headache of being sued ~~and jailed~~ for an abortion, for any reason (the bill makes no exception for rape or incest!), take your pills, get your rings, shots, implants, IUD, tubes tied, whatever your choice is NOW before we can't. You can order plan b on Amazon much cheaper, and there's plenty of online doctors willing to get you birth control at an affordable price without insurance. If you want your tubes tied keep advocating for yourself until you find a doctor that will do it for you. \n\nAnd most importantly talk to your husbands\/boyfriends about this. Discuss what they can do to help; It's unfair this bill puts the responsibility of the pregnancy 100% on the woman. Discuss your options if you were to get pregnant. Start tracking your periods and ovulation cycles. There is definitely apps for that. I'm serious. You'll thank me for it later. \n\n\nScrew you Greg Abbott.\n\n\n*Edit: Thanks everyone for the interactions and awards. Please educate yourself on how you can prevent an unwanted pregnancy, as well as the many resources that are online to help get you what you need (birth control, implants, plan b, IUDs, ect).

Vote these people out, be loud about it, and always advocate to your rights to your body. For those looking to leave Texas, I don't blame you lol. Thank you so much to everyone!! \u2764\u2764\u2764*\n\n**EDIT 3: I can't see any new comments from within the hour (it's almost 9pm here). I've also corrected my wording and I did have two different bills confused; however the matter still stands as is; abortions are outlawed past 6 weeks and we can be sued, doctors can lose their licenses and clinics. There are proposed bills to have penalties such as prison time and the death penalty, but these have not been passed yet. My biggest advice is to VOTE and always protect your sexual organs. I apologize for any confusion; either way this is still outrageous**\n\nEdit 4: Uhm, hello r\/all.

Like, its been disgusting how much pressure men have put towards violating a boundary I clearly state before getting into any sexual situation. I've had men beg me to play with my butt hole. I don't care if other people like anal, it's not for me and I shouldn't be pressured into doing something I'm not comfortable with. **I don't put pressure on men to do sexual things they state they aren't comfortable with and I expect the same respect in turn.**\n\nWhat really grinds my gears is that if you ask most of these men if they'd let someone who has at least >50lbs on them go to town on their butt holes, they say no. They have no interest in having their anus violated. But why? **Men have an actual orgasm button in their butt holes so if anyone should be taking it up the ass in a cishet relationship, it makes far more sense for the man to be on the receiving end of anal.** (and yes I know there are plenty of cishet men who do butt stuff, I'm talking about the ones who only want to violate women's anuses and not have theirs even touched)\n\nI hate the double standard of women needing to make their butt holes available for penetration, knowing full well we have far less of a chance from orgasming from anal stimulation than men, while men can keep their butt holes virginal. It's been relieving to dial back on dating and hooking up with men because I don't have to worry about someone pressuring me into doing something I don't want to do. I've had partners violate my boundaries and sexually assault me by trying to do anal, and that's an incredibly terrifying and gross experience I don't want to go through again.\n\nEdit: to all the women who have been leaving comments here saying they have been anally raped and sexually assaulted by men, my heart goes out to you. Far too many us of have experienced this. It is so disgusting that there are some men out there who do this to women.\n\nEdit 2: cishet = cisgendered heterosexual, it refers to a cis woman and cis man being together.\n\nEdit 3: some people here have suggested that *some* men only have an interest in penetrating a woman's asshole to cause pain, degradation and humiliation. I've received a few DMs from men asking me to recount tales of negative and painful experiences I've had with anal sex, so I think you're on to something there.","title":"Why are women pressured into receiving anal sex so much when men are the ones with orgasm buttons in their butts?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/wmkxq1\/why_are_women_pressured_into_receiving_anal_sex\/","upvote_ratio":0.73,"over_18":true}

He was attentive and charming. He managed to convince me to move to a city hundreds of miles away (where he was from). He took my passport, he opened a joint bank account for us and cancelled my individual account. He took out a loan in both our names and spent all the money on his outstanding debts. \nHe started to beat me almost every day. He started raping me when I said no to sex. He strangled me until I was unconscious and had sex with me while I was passed out.\nHe made me feel like it was all my fault and told me I deserved it. \nI began believing him. I blamed myself and began hating myself. I began living for the far and few between moments of tenderness and love he showed me. It felt like I was playing a game I didn\u2019t know the rules of. \n\nI managed to make some very supportive friends and eventually I managed to leave this relationship with the help of my friends. He began to stalk and harass me so I went to the police about everything. This was in summer 2018.\n\nThe police investigated, handed it to the crown prosecution service and they decided to charge him with 5 counts of rape and one count of assault (resulting in ABH). It took almost 3 years but this week it went to trial. \n\nWhen they played my video recorded evidence from 3 years ago people in the jury cried. I gave evidence in the court room behind screens as to not having to see my abuser. \nI stood up and was cross examined by the Defense barrister who told me to my face I was lying and that my ex partner was a kind and loving person. My cross examination took almost 2 hours and was the most humiliating and painful thing I ever had to do. \nBut I did it. I stood up in court and told my truth and ultimately stood up to him. \n\nOn Friday I got the call. The jury found my ex unanimously guilty of all charges and he has been remanded into custody with a sentencing hearing scheduled the second week of July. He is probably looking at double figures in jail. \n\nIt has taken 3 years, but it is finally over. I feel like I can finally breathe. And maybe, hopefully, I have saved at least one woman from going through the same hell I did. \nI still can\u2019t believe it and keep breaking down crying.\nNothing will undo the pain and humiliation he put me through but I am proud of myself for surviving until now.

A good part of those comments were not only encouraging him to leave her, they were justifying and celebrating that. In fact, many comments went as far as claiming how her father abandoning her wouldn't even be traumatic for her or how it would be best for everyone, including her. How this is possible is beyond me.\n\nReddit usually doesn\u2019t affect me. But right now I feel so angry I have a pounding headache.\n\nPlease let me introduce myself. Hello everyone, I am \u2018nothing but a reminder of deception\u2019 and \u2018reminder of a betrayal every single day\u2019 and an \u2018something that would raise only resentment\u2019, \u2018not his daughter\u2019, \u2018unfortunate consequence of whoring\u2019.\n\nMy parents had a very unhappy marriage. Lots of cheating and arguing. My mother cheated on my father when she was 25 with my father\u2019s best friend (on a side note, my father had cheated on her and continued cheating on her after his. In fact, they had this cycle of revenge where my mother would cheat to get back to my dad for his affair.). She fell pregnant and gave birth to me. I was 11 when I found out about it. It was the most traumatic period of my life and I am still recovering from it, 12 years later. My grandparents and other family members cut out contact with me. I am not allowed in their house, I have not received anything from them nor spoke to them for the last 12 years, unlike my brothers. I was present in the room when my grandmother explained how my father should not hold me in his arms because I am bastard, unlike my two brothers. I know my grandparents straight out told him to never see me again. During this period, I started urinating my bed at night and having mental breakdowns at school. I was so terrified of my father leaving me that I had my suicide planned in case the day he would realize I wasn\u2019t worthy of his love because of my genetics would come. I wasn\u2019t just scared, I was horrified. I remember being so anxious I had daily trouble with just breathing.\n\nBut my father didn\u2019t do that. What he did instead was consoling me, again and again, on how much he loved me. He came to school after I locked myself in the bathroom with scissors to defend me. He did not once exclude me from the time he had with us (the kids). I was always afraid he would come to pick us up but leave with only my brothers, leaving me behind.  But that never happened, the contrary. He always had time for all of us and interest in our lives, despite working brutally long hours. He has been my biggest inspiration, my biggest motivator. He is always there when I need him. Just writing about my dad brings tears to my eyes. He is a man who learned how to do a french braid so I didn't have hair on my face when I was at my practice.\n\nI just texted him, thanking him from being my dad. He replied: \u201cI love you. being your dad is my privilege.\u201d\n\nps. I just have to point out that I have read countless comments in Reddit that justify men cheating and having affairs. And not only justify them, but glorify it. In fact, there are entire subs dedicated to that.\n\nEdit: Thank you. I am overwhelmed by the kinds messages and somehow it is very soothing after the hundreds of messages that felt personally insulting and degrading. Not only that, pretty much dehumanizing. Thank you. I am glad I wrote this.","title":"I am NOT a reminder of betrayal, I am his daughter.

Today even more so, as I had just finished tubing down a river wearing a skintight long sleeved shirt and leggings to cover up from the sun (I wear shorts over my leggings to prevent unfortunate bulges). I was walking back to my car when a shiny SUV pulled up next to me and an elderly gentleman called out \"Need a ride, sweetheart?\"\nI turned to look at him and he visibly recoiled and drove off before I could say anything.

But realizing that I was dripping wet, wearing skintight clothing, walking alone.... Yeah I doubt it.\nI'm sorry. That experience terrified me, even as a guy with 7 years of martial arts experience.

As the guys came up and started getting pieces of cake I told them (very loudly) how lucky they were that I came into work that night.

He tried. He really did. But he handed me off to a kind lady to fit me (34A) and then bought me several bras.  No questions asked-I bought several sports bras, a couple cute ones and a padded one. \n\nMy dad is Catholic. He would walk through a fire for me, but bra shopping was hard for him.  He deserves all the love. He would buy me feminine products and ice cream when I needed it. All he asked was that I don\u2019t tell him too many details\u2014unless I needed to, and then he would listen. 10\/10, best dad. \n\nFast forward to adulthood. I\u2019ve got a Victoria Secret credit card, and a coupon book. I buy myself a nice bra every month for a year (the coupon book makes the bras cost the same -or less- than Walmart!). \n\nOne day a nice lady asks me if I need help, I hold up a bra and ask it if she has it in 34A. She asks if I\u2019m shopping for myself...?  I tell her yes. \n\nShe asks if she can give me a bra fitting...?  She has the customer service smile in place.\n\n I think, I get it\u2014she has to do so many fitting a day!  She wants to measure me to meet a quota. Sure!!  I love helping people out. I\u2019m the kinda person, I\u2019ll definitely do that survey you offer me because your boss needs so many a day. I\u2019m not in a hurry, knock yourself out!  \n\nSo she measures me. \n\n36DD. \n\n36DD. \n\nI\u2019ve been muffin-topping out of an A cup since I was a teenager. I was 13 when I was first fitted.  It never occurred to me that my size changed. I thought it was constant, like my eye color or hair color. \n\nMy sisters were both A cups, they were prettier than me, it never occurred to me I wasn\u2019t the same size (or larger?) than them. \n\nSo she brought me the right size. \n\nThey didn\u2019t hurt. It didn\u2019t hurt to breathe!\n\nThey didn\u2019t have a weird, bumpy outline under my shirt. \n\nI felt good.  \n\nI bought three. I donated my old ones (which were practically brand new) to a women\u2019s shelter. \n\nI\u2019ve bought a bra about every other month or so. \n\nThank you Victoria Secret lady. You gambled that I wasn\u2019t a bitch who would be mad you put me in a size larger than I thought.\n\nAnd thank you so much for telling me **I wasn\u2019t just fat.**. \n\nWhen you have sisters who are a foot shorter than you and fifty pounds lighter you feel like a moose among deer.  When they call you \u201cEl Lardo,\u201d you laugh, and then don\u2019t eat for a few days. \n\nThey were petite blondes and I was a curvy brunette. \n\nNext to them I was huge, but I wasn\u2019t fat, I just had a chest and a booty. They were self-conscious about being flat chested, and they mercilessly taunted the sister who wasn\u2019t.  They called my breasts a \u201cfat roll.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d shamed me, I wouldn\u2019t have recovered. Instead, you made me feel good about my size. You told me it was normal to miss a cup change. You made me feel good about my body. \n\nThank you random Victoria Secret Lady. I called your manager and thanked her for your good service, but that was more than 10 years ago. I hope you know you saved me from years of discomfort and self loathing.

I went to the police after he emailed me my home address, then told me he didn\u2019t care if he had to rape me, I was having his baby, *then* he turned up on my doorstep. He got 4 years in prison and I have a restraining order against him. \n\nSome fucking moron has messaged me and asked me about how I feel now about telling him face to face that it wouldn\u2019t work out, and do I HONESTLY (his capitalisation) think I was kind in telling him or was I abrupt\/scared? Did I highlight his qualities and explain the elements that made us incompatible. \n\nYou fucking what, mate? He didn\u2019t give a shit about threatening me with rape and death, and harassing me for 10 years, but I\u2019m supposed to feel guilt or sympathy because I rejected him?? All I feel towards him is hatred but I can\u2019t stand that there are men, men who don\u2019t even know him and that this has no impact on, who will fall over themselves to try to blame me or feel bad for him.

The subreddit is supposedly 75% women but they're out here calling other women \"breeders\" and \"broodmares.\" They mock pregnant and postpartum bodies and spread misinformation about birth and pregnancy. Some women tear when they have kids, but they don't all get a \"vagasshole\" from giving birth. They don't all lose all their hair and teeth and age ten years. Not every man is an unwilling father who got \"baby trapped\" into having kids.\n\nThey slut-shame single moms and assume a woman should have seen a divorce coming ten years early. \n\nAnd when you call them out on their shit, they say it's not valid to call them misogynists even though all they do is hate on women who chose to do something different than they did. \n\nWomen CAN be misogynists, but we shouldn't be.\n\nEdit: To the people who say that I \"don't get\" the sub or lack nuance: I'm in a lesbian relationship, and my mom still asks me all the time if we're going to adopt or get a sperm donor someday. I get societal pressure on women to procreate. Maybe doubly so because I'm LGBTQ and also ducked the system that way. You can hate the system oppressing you without hating women who make different choices than you.\n\nEdit 2: to the people who recommended truechildfree, I'm looking into other spaces where I would be a better fit, but I wanted to make this post to point out what I saw in the regular childfree sub. \n\nTo the people who said I'm not really childfree myself, baby you don't know me.

This isn't the first dick pic I have received in my life, however this is the first time I've had the courage to do something about it, not only for me but for all women. What he did is illegal. Maybe not in your country (even though it should be, wtf), but it is in mine. I didn't want to see his dick, I didn't want to hear about how he'd love to come on my feet, why should it be MY JOB to see his dick, block him, and move on, when he could, you know, respect women and NOT SEND PICTURES OF HIS DICK IN THE FIRST PLACE? God. Are you all so desensitized to shit you see online that a clear violation of your boundaries is NBD? Also what's to say he's not gonna send a picture of his dick to another woman once I've blocked him? I am done putting up with this kind of shit. It's 2019. **Respect women or face the consequences of your actions.**\n\nQ: Backstory please?   \nA: Alright it's gonna be short and sweet. Last may, this prince charming added me on facebook, I messaged him to ask if we knew each other because at the time I was working on my girlfriend's documentary and meeting a lot of new people whose name I did not always remember. He told me that unfortunately, we did not, but he would love to get to know me. I told him that I wasn't interested. He sent a few pictures of himself, told me \"see, now you see who I am ;)\", tried flirting with me to convince me, I shut that shit down, told him that I am a lesbian, in a relationship, and not interested in making friends with him. Fast forward to tonight where I have the utter pleasure to get two dick pics completely out of the blue, soon followed by a video because \"he's single, horny and I'm pretty\", because as we say in french, monsieur is a poet.  I told him to stop several times, and this Shakespeare reborn then wrote \"I'm gonna cum\" and \"Hopefully on your pretty little feet\". That's it. That's the backstory. I didn't block him in case the cops didn't want me to. \n\nQ: What's gonna happen now?   \nA: The police will probably contact me in the upcoming weeks to hand over my facebook info and this happened over Messenger. A man was recently convicted of sexual harassment over a dick pic for the first time in France, so they're starting to have a process in place, if that makes sense. \n\nQ: You are a bitch\/sad\/pathetic\/a typical triggered female.   \nA: Thanks! :) \n\nI know a baby dog is a puppy, I'm sorry I was just so surprised to see a dog in a police station at this hour that the only things I could think about were \"dog!\" and \"baby!!\", we do have a word for \"puppy\" in French too!","title":"The dickpic that broke the camel\u2019s back: I am currently at the police station to report someone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/dv2b7g\/the_dickpic_that_broke_the_camels_back_i_am\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false}

I began crying and aimlessly walking toward the next bus stop. I had no idea how to get home - only knew if I could get to the main station, then there was a chance. But i didn\u2019t know where i was or how to get there. I got on the first bus and asked if it took me there. It did not - but somewhat close to there. And i just couldn\u2019t stop crying. \n\nOut of no where - this guy swooped in and asked me if i was ok. He heard me crying and was so concerned about me. And me being scared and drunk i told him my issue and what city I lived in. He gathered his guys (they were a couple of friends who went out together) and went to tell me not to worry and promised they would get me home safe. \n\nThey tried to cheer me up and asked me about life and school. Introduced themselves and asked if I had anyone I would like to call. Offered me their phones. I called my mom and bf - and neither picked up - so they wrote them a text explaining the situation. And that they were helping me get home and not to worry. \n\n\nWe all finally got on the train together headed for the city i live in (two of them were headed the same way) and helped me check in and even offered to pay for my way home if necessary.\n\nWe finally got to my city and they smiled - asked if could find my way back home (i could) - and then said goodbye and left. They wanted nothing from me but knowing i was safe. \n\nI have been so moved by this experience. A group of guys in their thirties taking their time to help a dumb little 21 year old me get home safe. Wanting nothing in return.\n\nIn a world so cruel and harsh as ours its been so incredible to know kind people still exist. I don not believe I will ever forget them. I just wish i could show them how grateful i am for their help.\n\nSo thats it. I just wanted to share some positive with you all.","title":"I was lost in the big city at night without my phone.

When I graduated from a 2-year degree program at the height of the recession, I drove 2 hours each way to an unpaid internship thinking it'd lead somewhere (it didn't, also...please don't do this, it's not worth it lol)\n\nMeanwhile, I was working double shifts at a grocery store (frying donuts from 3-7 am and then working 8 AM to sometimes 9 PM, depending on the shift). My next job had me working 6-6 Monday through Friday and 6-2 on Saturdays during the busy season (mandatory overtime).\n\nThen I got what I thought was a real, professional job in a bigger city. My boss was...something else. He yelled at me on my first day because I accidentally sent someone to his voicemail that I shouldn't have (I didn't know any better). Every day got worse after that.\n\nAfter weeks of waking up with panic attacks every morning at 3 or 4 AM, I approached him and broke down because I thought I had accepted a position related to my field but the job actually required large-scale proposal writing (which I had no experience in and which the position offered no training). He promised to take those from me and had me focus on what I was skilled at. Later, in a meeting with the entire team, he announced that I would always be a low-level worker bee. The next week, to a smaller group (with me present), he said \"Let's be real, BushyEyes isn't doing well here.\" After several months in the position, I was fired. In that moment, I was convinced that I would never amount to anything. (Shout-out to the barista at the cafe down the street for the complimentary latte and cookie to a crying, newly unemployed girl)\n\nI don't want to say that he inspired me to be better because I don't want to give him any credit for my hard work. Today, though, I think back and remember those words as my promotion to director level became official. I manage a team of 15 people and I support and nurture their development and I take a service-oriented approach to leadership instead of bringing them down to make myself look big. I honestly couldn't be happier!","title":"8 years ago, an ex-boss told me (in front of my coworkers) that I would always be a low-level worker bee.

Like many naive young women, she thought her labia minora were not supposed to stick out.\n\nShe had read online, on surgeons\u2019 websites and in peer-reviewed medical literature, that protruding labia minora were considered \u201cunfeminine\u201d and \u201cembarrassing.\u201d She read they were caused by excess male hormones (untrue) and excess masturbation (preposterous).\n\nHe had been recommended by the head of the OB\/GYN department as the best OB\/GYN surgeon at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. She was confident she was in good hands. They waited until after she turned 18 to do the procedure.\n\nHe completely removed her labia minora, performed a clitoral hood reduction without her consent, and cut the dorsal nerves of her clitoris. The glans of her clitoris would never be sexually sensitive again. Cunnilingus would never again be pleasurable.\n\nHe had only done a labiaplasty twice before. Like most OB\/GYNs who do these procedures, he had not been trained to do them. He never disclosed that anything had gone wrong, but he stopped doing these surgeries after that.\n\nShe knew she had lost sensation but didn\u2019t understand what that meant. She assumed everything would work out when she started having sex. She thought it was her fault. She didn\u2019t know enough about her anatomy to understand he had done a separate surgery without her consent. She started seeing a new doctor because she was so uncomfortable. The new doctor was his partner. Upon seeing an 18 year old with completely amputated labia minora, she said nothing.\n\nLater, the young woman worked up the courage to ask her doctor if her surgery had caused her difficulty with orgasm. She could not feel anything without a vibrator, she said. Despite the visible scars reaching well into her clitoral hood, her female doctor told her her surgery could not have affected her sexual function.\n\nThe original male doctor meanwhile became president of the Texas Medical Association.\n\nThe young woman finally found her clitoris. The glans was not sensitive like it was supposed to be. She went to a new female doctor. The new doctor also told her her surgery could not have affected her sexual function. She suggested she fall in love. Though the new doctor was \u201chorrified\u201d that all her labia minora had been amputated, she did not tell her she could report it.\n\nThe young woman started doing research. Eventually she figured out a clitoral hood reduction had been performed without her consent. Given the course of the dorsal nerves along the clitoral body, she figured out they must have been injured.\n\nThe young woman did a lot of research. She realized the course of the dorsal nerves was never mentioned in literature on clitoral hood reductions. It was never shown in OB\/GYN journals. It was never shown in OB\/GYN textbooks. She also learned that the sexual function of the labia minora was rarely described. She thought her doctor must not have realized they were important. How else could he have completely amputated them? She thought he must not have realized the dorsal nerves were at risk. She decided this error must have occurred because her doctor didn\u2019t know the anatomy.\n\nShe wrote him a letter telling him what he had done and asking him to help her change training standards to protect other patients.\n\nHe responded reminding her that the surgery was her choice. He reminded her that she had requested her labia minora not stick out. He had only tried to give her what she asked for.\n\nHe told her he stayed far away from her clitoral hood and frenulum. But there were scars to prove otherwise.\n\nThe young woman became emotionally unstable after reading this letter. She wanted to report him but was told the board would likely blame her and take his side. She had never had what happened to her confirmed by a doctor, so she went to see one. It was confirmed. This was what she had needed to give legitimacy to her complaint, she thought.\n\nBut it became unbearable. No one around her seemed to understand the magnitude of what had happened. People asked her what the big deal was. People asked her why she needed justice. When she tried to talk to therapists, they asked about her feelings about her mother. It had taken 7 years to finally get it confirmed. She had hoped it was fixable somehow. It wasn\u2019t fixable.\n\nShe felt ashamed. How could she have been so stupid to not file a lawsuit when there was still time? She read research on resilience. Based on all the parameters surrounding her trauma, she did not think she could ever be okay. It was like getting horribly raped in a world where rape isn\u2019t considered a crime. She read she needed acknowledgment, support, etc. Most of all, she needed to change the problem of pervasive systemic negligence. But no one was even seeing it. She didn\u2019t like the wreck of a person she was becoming.\n\nOne night she set Joy Division \u201cAtmosphere\u201d on repeat, took 60 Vicodin, some Xanax, some Benadryl hoping that would help stop her heart, and as much whiskey as she could drink. Her dad checked on her in the middle of the night. He took her to the hospital.\n\nShe was afraid to report after that. She was afraid of getting told it was her fault. She was afraid of people defending her doctor. One OB\/GYN she had gone to had said:\n\n\u201cYou should have known all surgery carried risk. You can never completely control a result.\u201d\n\nIt had been wrong site surgery. That should never happen. But she was afraid of this. She was afraid even doctors wouldn\u2019t understand the difference between the labia minora and the clitoral hood.\n\nShe told herself she would report him when she got more stable. Back then there was no statute of limitations. She thought she had time.\n\nWhen she finally got the courage to report, they had passed a new statute of limitations. She missed it by a week.\n\nSo she started coming up with new ideas for how to stand up for herself. She wrote a letter to the head of patient safety at the hospital. He agreed to meet with her. But she was too afraid. She thought if she wrote down everything she needed to say, complete with references, this would help. She started writing.\n\nBut she hated writing. She\u2019d never been any good at it.\n\nShe wrote what she called, \u201cA Clinical History, Causal Analysis, and Proposed Solutions.\u201d She wrote a background of the anatomy and prevalence of labiaplasty. She wrote a clinical history of herself. Then she broke down all the causal factors accordingly:\n1. Motivation\n2. Cause of surgical error\n3. Failure to disclose or report\n\nThen she wrote a proposal. Solving problems at every error point was important. She got a bit overwhelmed. There were so many problems.\n\nShe got very stuck. She kept getting dizzy. She\u2019d get angry at herself for getting dizzy. She was being weak, she thought.\n\nPeople asked when she was ever going to do anything worthwhile. They told her she was lazy. She didn\u2019t deserve to live in such a nice apartment, they said. She didn\u2019t deserve to wear such nice clothes, they said. She didn\u2019t deserve vacations. She should be ashamed of herself for not having a career like everyone else. They told her she wasn\u2019t dealing with this well. When was she ever going to learn to deal with anything? She mostly kept to herself. When she tried to date, issues would come up. Men told her they couldn\u2019t date her because she was emotionally unstable. One said he\u2019d rather date a barista with a plan.\n\nThe worst part isn\u2019t what happened. The worst part is how much I came to hate myself for not handling it better. I\u2019m working on that. \n\nMy doctor isn\u2019t some random \u201cbad apple.\u201d He is an extremely reputable OB\/GYN. He has been president of the Texas Medical Association and president of the Dallas County Medical Society. \nOther doctors still talk about his \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201cselflessness,\u201d as they give him awards. He was also featured in Time Magazine for delivering the first uterus transplant baby. \n\nBut honestly, the worst part isn\u2019t what happened to me. The worst part has been everything that has happened since in my struggle to get acknowledgment and to address the systemic negligence that continues to put others at risk.\n\nIf I could get my doctor to acknowledge what he did, he has the political power to help change training standards to keep other patients safe. Instead, he refuses to acknowledge it. Though his colleague has explained to him that I have visible scars proving what he did, he insists he didn\u2019t do it. He says I must have had a second surgery or that I operated on myself.\n\nPerhaps the worst part is how medical leadership has stood by him and refused to even talk to me about changing curriculums and board exams because of who my doctor was. This happened due to systemic negligence that will not change as long as people refuse to admit there is any problem. Doctors continue to do vulvar cosmetic surgeries (and treatment of hypertrophy) without training.\n\nEven with my dad as the head of the plastic surgery department at the same hospital where my doctor works, we cannot get through to him. The OB\/GYN department refuses to speak to either me or my dad. After I asked them to teach clitoral neurovascular anatomy, they called legal to make sure they can\u2019t get sued for not teaching it.\n\nUpdate: We are publishing a cadaver dissection study of the neural anatomy of 10 clitorises, of which we took excellent photos. There is a new head of the OB\/GYN department who wants the residents to learn it. I also got a form letter from ABOG, in which they claim to be working on new board exam questions.\n\nSecond update: I have gotten authors of two major OB\/GYN textbooks (Te Linde, Williams) to publish detailed clitoral anatomy. I also convinced an OB\/GYN to oversee a study published in AJOG. And finally, my study was published in The Aesthetic Surgery Journal. \n\nHowever, I have not been successful at changing privileging. To this day, someone as equally as unqualified my doctor can still get privileges to do labiaplasties at the surgery center where mine occurred and at many others. USPI, the biggest ambulatory care provider in the US, declined to require training in these procedures. Another problem is many of these are performed in private offices, where there is generally no oversight. \n\nLabiaplasty is still the fastest growing cosmetic procedure, as it has been for almost 2 decades.\n\nIf you or a friend has a similar story, please contact me. One expert I talk to believes there are thousands like me. Based on the other stories I have gotten, it is typical for women to get gaslighted in these situations and told their issues are psychological. This happens due to pervasive ignorance of vulvar anatomy and female sexual function in medicine. \n\nI need more women who are willing to be interviewed by a journalist. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nEdit: thanks everyone so much for all the upvotes and supportive comments! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to share this, but my Instagram is @jessica_ann_pin. I talk about this and related issues there. This is my latest post showing how cross sections of the penis are always shown in anatomy textbooks but cross sections of the clitoris are shown in 0 anatomy textbooks: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B6bnuKSp4Rt\/?igshid=kp2hm8adb2oy\n\nThird update: I have gotten 18 medical textbooks to agree to updates. 4 have now been published. I\u2019ve also gotten Medscape, UpToDate, and WebMD to agree to updates.\n\nABOG now requires urogynecologists to learn clitoral innervation as part of their maintenance of certification. They have made it incentivized learning for gynecologists. They still refuse to make it required learning for gynecologists. \n\nACOG still refuses to dictate the innervation of the clitoris be taught in all OB\/GYN residency programs. Here is my petition to change this. It has 27,000 signatures so far. \n\nhttp:\/\/chng.it\/jts9PZLz","title":"The story about labiaplasty you haven\u2019t heard","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/eeyle3\/the_story_about_labiaplasty_you_havent_heard\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

It opened my eyes to how balanced life could be, and what a society is like when equality is taken seriously. \n\nOne of the first things that struck me was  no ogling.. I could walk around without unwanted stares or comments that used to happen to me daily in America. Men are much more professional at work, I am no longer constantly questioning their motives.\n\nUniversity here is free, and there are a better mix of women in STEM fields compared to many other countries. For example, there are more female physicians in Norway than male physicians. \n\nWork life balance is deeply valued. We have a 37.5 hour work week, and flexible working is the norm. If you are having a baby you and your partner can choose between 49 weeks of maternity leave (+ 3 weeks before birth) at 100% pay or 59 weeks (+ 3 weeks before birth) at 80% pay. Fathers have to take a minimum of 15 weeks of paternity leave. The same benefits apply for adoption and same sex couples. You get extra paid time for multiples as well. Everyone gets 5 weeks paid vacation, basically unlimited paid sick leave and child care days for when your kids are sick. \n\nHealthcare is basically free. You pay a small copay (around $30) for a doctors visit. If you use more than around $300 on prescriptions and visits then you get something called blue prescription that means you don\u2019t have to pay for anything anymore. Baby related care, checkups and prenatal care is 100% free. If I\u2019m not mistaken Norway also has the lowest maternal death rates in the world. Kids healthcare is completely free. \n\nWhen I gave birth to my son I did not see a single man at the hospital besides my partner. It was the most amazing and supportive birthing environment. When I had a missed miscarriage and needed medicine to help my body start clearing it out, I was again surrounded by supportive all female medical staff, no judgement, no rules stopping me from receiving lifesaving care. \n\nThe vast majority of men here are raised to contribute equally, from childcare to cleaning and cooking. It is expected to split these duties equally. Toxic masculinity isn\u2019t really a thing here. \n\nNorway has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world. There has been one school shooting here (no casualties) and one bad terrorist attack (22nd July). There have been 2000+ school shootings in the US since 1970. \n\nIs it perfect here? No. But in my opinion it\u2019s a thousand times better than the US (and like 30 years ahead rights wise). \n\nMy grandparents were holocaust survivors who went to the US for a better life. I love the US and it breaks my heart to see it deteriorating. I always planned to move back but now I don\u2019t feel like there is anything to go back to. I could never give up the freedom I have here.\n\nIf you have the chance to get out, do it! There are so many better places to live. Places where women are seen as equals  not incubators. Places where children\u2019s live are worth more than someone\u2019s hobby.\n\nEDIT: a lot of people mentioned that I must have been rich to be able to move to Europe or come from a wealthy family. Lol ya\u2019ll I wish but no. Grandparents came here as refugees with no money and worked factory jobs after coming to US. My mom worked sorting packages and my dad was a house painter. We were 3 kids and broke. I worked 30-40 hours a week the whole time I was in college, had student loans etc. \n\nIf someone is sponsoring you in Norway (for example if you get married), the minimum income they need to have is around 30,000 dollars a year to bring you over. You can work at McDonald\u2019s and make more than that here. \n\nIt\u2019s not just higher education that you can get a work visa for in Norway, you can also get a visa for being a waiter or working in tourism related industries, and a lot of other seasonal work as well so it is really a lower threshold here than other countries. The immigration system here is considerably simpler than other countries, and very modern. \n\nI mentioned in the comments that I was extremely lucky to get the opportunity to move and know that not everyone will have the same opportunity. I didn\u2019t formulate what I was trying to say very well in my original post but I almost didn\u2019t move when I had the chance, and my life would have been completely different if I hadn\u2019t. I just wanted to encourage those people who might have the chance or could get there to try. I\u2019m not saying the process is as easy as \u201cjust do it\u201d. It takes time, work and money. I needed around $1200 for visa and flights to get to Norway. \n\nI love the US and grew up in a family that talked about the American dream, but it was never a reality for us. My family still struggles and some of them refuse to believe that things could be better in Norway than the US.","title":"For those of your considering leaving the US, just do it.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/uxmpv1\/for_those_of_your_considering_leaving_the_us_just\/","upvote_ratio":0.62,"over_18":false}

I had (have) a lot of hangups when it comes to sex and so I wanted to take things slow. This dude came at me with every excuse he could think of if he got an erection, \"It huUurts!\"\n\n\"You're making me feel bad about getting it!\"\n\n\"You dont know how bad this feels if you don't do anything with it!\" And being 17 and stupid,  I let him convince me of doing more than I was remotely comfortable with just for his comfort. As an adult, I hate the fact it happened that way and I wish I had kicked him but that's in the past.\n\nLast night, my boyfriend and I were hanging out in his apartment finishing up a movie. He had told me going in that he was a physically affectionate guy but that he would go at my pace. I couldn't even hug the man right on our first date but as I got more comfortable around him I got more comfortable with his physical affection. We start kissing and generally just having a good time before I had to leave to go home. He rolls me into a certain position and I can feel it against my stomach. And in the back of my mind, I'm waiting for it. Some excuse or push against my boundaries to see what I would do. I moved a certain way to make sure I didn't hurt him and he asked me what was going on. I motion my head towards his erection and instead of an excuse, all he says is, \"Oh don't worry about it. It'll go away in a couple of minutes.\"\n\nNo excuses.\n\nNo whining.\n\nWe keep making out for a while until I have to go home and I am on freaking cloud 9.\n\nSo, moral of the story, let your boundaries be where they are! You will find someone who respects them and your boundaries will change with that person as you get comfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit: RIP my phone, firstly.

Secondly, as for why my high school bf didn't just jerk one off instead of making me feel guilty, he tried that and if I remember right (this was at least five years ago now) he said something to the effect of, \"I don't like jerking off in secret just because you feel weird about it.\" A real charmer, that one.

When it's boiled and limp, it just becomes unable to understand, so it asks questions. Here is a perfect example that happened yesterday;\n\nParent to 6 year old student in front of me: I hope you listen to your teacher. If she was *my* teacher, I would definitely be looking at her all day long and keeping quiet. *winks*\n\nMe: I'm sorry, I don't understand. Why would you want your child to just stare at me all day long?\n\nParent: Uh, because it's polite. \n\nMe: It's polite for a child to look at me all day long and to keep quiet?\n\nParent: Yes. \n\nMe: Why? \n\nParent: I was just saying that. \n\nMe: I really enjoy when your child interacts with me.

Why do women need more bathroom breaks? \n\nPerson: Well, for... periods and other things.\n\nMe: What? \n\nPerson: It takes more time to change a pad than to pee. \n\nMe: It does? \n\nPerson: I think it does. \n\nMe: I don't calculate it but I'd assume it couldn't possibly be so long that it would change anything. \n\nPerson: I don't know.\n\nEdit: Person here was trying to say that because women spend more time in the bathroom, our salary should reflect this. More time in the bathroom = more time away from work = less $. I'm not arguing that it takes more or less time to change a pad than to pee in urinals and going.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd I mean, it's been working with a whole bunch of different scenarios. It's been life changing as advice and what I personally love about it, is that it makes the person itself question what *they* said.

Unfortunately I was not. He didn\u2019t ask me any questions about myself and he gave me a 30 minute monologue about the ins and outs of his job (ranting about parts of the cloud and types of servers). A girl at the table next to me kept looking over at me, clearly seeing this was a painful conversation and that I felt stuck. I went to the bathroom to clear my head. I thought if I reject this guy, will he hurt me? Will he cause a scene. Not that he gave me indicators that he would but you never know.\n\nI came back to the table, and he asked me where I would like to go next. I thought about it for a moment and said, \u201chonestly I don\u2019t feel any chemistry here, and I don\u2019t want to waste any more of your time. If you want me to pay for my ice cream, I\u2019m more than willing to do that.\u201d He was taken aback but respectful.\n\nOld me NEVER would have done this.

Thirty... I'm 30. I should have just used the numbers in the first place, reading comprehension is hard I know... I am an adult, not thirteen. Also while I'm here, huge shoutout to the guy who called me \"a drama queen with a blind eye\", I kind of loved it, thank you.\n\nAs a contextual thing, I take a lot of Ubers because I am functionally blind in one eye and the lack of depth perception causes me to be unable to drive.\n\nThis guy was my Uber driver home from work yesterday morning (I work nights). He told me that I looked to be about the same age as him and I laughed as he looked to be in his mid-forties and I am having my thirtieth birthday in a couple of weeks, but he seemed surprised when I told him my age and made a joke about \"there goes my five stars\". That was slightly awkward but no big deal, I gave him the same five stars I give to every Uber driver who doesn't act like an enormous asshole. But then he drove me home again this morning.\n\nAt first I thought that he was just in his usual area or what have you, but this man felt perfectly comfortable with telling me that he had pulled into the parking lot and had waited for ten minutes for me to come out and order an Uber. What the unholy fuck?! So I'm already uncomfortable. \n\nHe asked me what I do on the weekends and I told him that that's when I spend my time with my friends. He then asked me whether I wanted one more friend, a question that I tried to dodge the pointed intention of by saying something like \"haha, it's always good to have friends\". But he told me that he \"was interested in getting to know me\" anyway and that's why he was waiting outside my work today. Said he likes how my laugh sounds.\n\nThen he started regaling me with sad tales of his personal life, including his mother's cancer. This was actually a slight improvement because it wasn't about me at all. \n\nTHEN, when he dropped me off he pointedly asked \"so how do I get in touch with you outside of (place I work in)?\". I was stunned into silence and he followed up with a standard sad-toned \"I don't?\". I basically told him that I didn't feel comfortable with that as I don't know him at all, got out of the car and didn't look back.\n\nThis is crazy. How does this complete stranger think that ANY ONE ELEMENT of this is even remotely appropriate? Just because a woman is friendly and smiles at you is no excuse to literally STALK HER outside of her job and push your company on her. I feel disgusted by the very idea that this guy may well be in that parking lot again on Monday morning and I will not be entering his vehicle ever again. If you ever need more evidence to not give these people your full address, you never know when someone may just decide to wait where they know you'll be.","title":"The Uber driver who drove me home from work yesterday was waiting outside of my work today","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/ewnxy6\/the_uber_driver_who_drove_me_home_from_work\/","upvote_ratio":0.84,"over_18":false}

We are too burnt out and underpaid to be doing any favors, especially not based on gender roles. So at our weekly meeting, my boss asked for a raise of hands of who would like to participate in Secret Santa. Most of the men raised their hands but my female colleague and I did not. My boss did a double-take and asked for a raise of hands again, clearly fishing for us to participate and jump into name-taking and rule-setting, but our hands remained in our laps. He then singled me out and asked if I was planning on participating and I said \"no\", short and sweet. So without any protest from any of the guys, he said \"ok, I guess we are passing on Secret Santa this year.\"\n\nNice!

So, I prodded a little bit over the course of a few hours, as I was concerned for him.\n\nWell, when he opened up...I was shocked.\n\nYesterday, a family of 5 walked into his restaurant, and the father wasn\u2019t wearing a mask. Currently, his restaurant requires that everyone wears a mask while entering the building, walking around the building, working, or leaving the building. And they hold to it.\n\nSo, a young teenage hostess asked the father if he had a mask...they have masks to provide to guests should they not have one.\n\nThe mother answered \u201cOh! He doesn\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d And chuckled.\n\nThe father...then lifted his shirt, revealing a gun on his hip, and stated \u201cWhen you have one of these, you don\u2019t need a mask!\u201d\n\nThe hostess made a quick and smart decision...she de-escalated the situation and sat the family at a table closest to the door.\n\nShe then immediately informed my boyfriend and the front of house manager of what happened. \n\nBoth managers assessed the situation, and decided to call the police. When the police showed up, they escorted the father to the parking lot. A few minutes later, the father re-entered the building, spoke with his family quietly, and they left the restaurant.\n\nCan you imagine being a teenager making minimum wage, being threatened by a grown man with a gun...over a mask being required on private property??\n\nHe literally threatened a teenager with a gun in order to gain access to private property...all because he didn\u2019t want to comply with restaurant\u2019s mask requirements, which are in line with current CDC recommendations and government mandates...\n\nThe hostess must be terrified to go back to work!\n\nI\u2019m terrified to go back to work at my restaurant!\n\nMy boyfriend worries if the father will retaliate, and if others will act as the father did...\n\nI\u2019ve rarely worried for my safety at work or the safety of others...but, fuck this guy for making so many people so fearful just to go to work, pay their bills, and live their lives!","title":"When Adult Men Physically Threaten Young Women","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/hyg447\/when_adult_men_physically_threaten_young_women\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

I\u2019ve had a consistent fever along with that crappy overall sick feeling. I got tested for COVID and it returned negative and I saw my PCP who thought it was just the flu. I thought she was probably right, so I thought nothing of it. Then, today, I get this horrible fucking pain in my lower abdomen and I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m having a heart attack because my chest was tight and I felt like I was going to pass out. I yelled at my husband \u201cAMBULANCE NOW!!\u201d When the paramedics arrived they told him I was probably just having an anxiety attack and they see this all the time in women. Then, when they took my blood pressure it was 196\/132 and my heart rate was 173. They took it THREE FUCKING TIMES while I lay there thinking I was going to die. Only then, when they saw it wasn\u2019t a fluke, did they hurry and get me to the hospital. Turns out I have sepsis and am spending the holidays in the hospital. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why these paramedics, all men, went straight to \u201cshe\u2019s having an anxiety attack like all women\u201d instead of taking this seriously. Where do they come off telling my husband that it\u2019s all in my head? I wish I could tell them my diagnosis and save other women this bullshit.\n\n\nEdit: Wow! I did not expect this to gain so much traction! Thank you to everyone who contributed to this post. For some more background, I think part of the reason it really settled badly with me is because I\u2019m immunocompromised (which I told them), and have multiple autoimmune diseases (which I told them) including fibrosis of the liver (which again I told them). Knowing all of this, they failed to take my condition seriously. I don\u2019t expect them to diagnosis me because I\u2019d have never thought it was sepsis from a kidney infection, but showing some concern and not seemingly brushing it off is frustrating when I felt like I was literally in that moment dying. My husband and I will be filing a complaint and I truly hope they do something to change the way they treat women. \n\nThank you also for the well wishes! It sucks to be in the hospital, but I\u2019m grateful for the care and compassion the nurses and doctors have shown me. Hopefully I respond well to the antibiotics and the pain let\u2019s up!!\n\n\n\nEdit2: To the person who felt compelled to direct message me simply to insult me, I\u2019m sorry someone peed in your hot chocolate. Happy holidays, you one layered lasagna.\n\n\nEdit3: To the person who wished that I will die from sepsis, you really need help. Wishing death on someone you don\u2019t even know is truly astounding. And on that note, since I\u2019m getting multiple messages filled with hate and hoping for my death, either don\u2019t send it because I\u2019ll just block you or find help.","title":"Paramedics told me I was having an \u201canxiety attack\u201d that \u201clots of women get\u201d - turned out to be sepsis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/kj6ldi\/paramedics_told_me_i_was_having_an_anxiety_attack\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false}

We were sitting and talking about what we should do when we got to my place and I told her I really wanted to show her Hannah Gadsby's Nanette.\n\nSuddenly I'm feeling something on my left upper thigh\/ upper butt cheek. I'm looking down, because I thought my cigarettes might be falling out of my pocket or something, but it felt wrong. And then I notced a man sitting on the seat behind me. My mind instantly thought of the posts I've read here from women being groped on the bus. Women who have stayed silent, because they were unsure if what they were really experiencing it or because they've been taught to never make a scene. I've been taught the same. I'm dead scared of confrontation and I constantly doubt my self.\n\nI'm also trying to learn self-love and building self-worth.\n\nWe're almost at our stop and we discuss getting off soon. I still wasn't sure if I was actually touched by the man behind me, but decided I would share it with my friend when we get off and discuss it with her.\n\nThen he touches me again. This time on my right side.\n\nSomething fucking snapped.\nI got up on my knees on the seat and turned around and looked down on the white man in his 30s in a grey track suit behind me. My voiced deepened and hardened as I ask him what the FUCK he thought he was doing. He didn't got a chance to answer before I loudly and firmly said that he should never EVER touch strangers on the bus. \n\nHe answered in a tone where he was trying to sound inoccent and trying to make me out to be the crazy one in this scenario. People were looking at us now. \"I haven't touched you. I don't know what you're talking about\" he said. \n\nI said to him that he knew exactly what I was talking about, that he was a fucking creep and that he should never ever grope women agian. \n\nAnd then we got off. \nAnd I was so fucking proud. \n\nI wouldn't have done this 6 months ago, but I'm now doing the most self-loving thing there is: trusting myself.\n\nAnd I made a fucking scene and that disgusting person had to sit there knowing that everybody in the bus knew that he was a creep who sexually assaults people.\n\nI wanted to share it with you ladies, because one of the things that made me trust my instinct when I thought something might be off was you sharing your similar stories (Sidenote: I can also recommend reading The Gift of Fear), so now I want to share mine with you.\n\nI still have to process the difficult emotions that come with being put in that situation, but sharing it with you is the first step in that proces. \n\nThank you\n\nEdit: I've been using my sunday morning reading comments and trying to answer a few where it made sense. The vast, vast majority of the comments have been supportive and you guys have shared your similar experiences and I so want to thank you for that. Sharing something like this, no matter how small or big the violation in itself was, is incredibly scary and I feel very vulnerable and overwhelmed right now. I did not expect this to get as much attention as it did and although a part of me wants to take it down, because I currently feel very exposed, I can see the value in and be grateful that it opened up for the discussion that it did. Although it saddens me that so many women can relate to this I truly appreciate you sharing your experiences here so we can make sure that the next woman this happens to trusts herself and her instincts. \n\nThere's a few comments questioning if I was sure it really was the guy and not my friend or some other explanation. My friend wouldn't do that. He was the only one in reach of me other than my friend. I'm also a person that most of the time doubt myself, my experiences and feelings. I do not doubt this experience.

When I was 23, I married the love of my life. We met in grade 10, we were high school sweethearts, dated all through college and got married after graduation. He was a wonderful, gentle giant of a man (6'5\", 240 lbs, big bushy beard, wore lots of flannel, great big smile that lit up his whole face). He was a social worker working with troubled teens at a group home. He was a survivor of abuse and neglect, and he was obsessed with helping kids who had a hard life like he did, being a role model for them, trying to show them there was another way than all the violence and anger. He was the best man I've ever known. I used to call him my oak tree. We were married for 7 months when he was killed in a car accident at 7PM on his way to the group home for a movie night with the boys. He died on impact. I'm told the other driver wasn't drunk, just negligent. I'm not quite sure why that would matter, but I can remember being told that like it was important information that I should know, and it's stayed in my mind.\n\nI was devastated. I still am really, I've never gotten over it. Everything was ripped away from me in that moment, our life together, all our plans, all the years, everything stolen. I was a mess, I was completely out of my head. I stopped going to work, I stopped bathing, stopped eating. I would find myself wandering downtown sobbing without any idea how I got there. I would lie in bed for 20 hours at a time. I don't even remember his funeral, the only thing I can remember from that day is my mother dressing me because I couldn't do it myself. I was shell-shocked into a zombie just stumbling through the world.\n\nAt some point in those weeks I realized I was pregnant. I didn't tell anyone. I didn't know how to process it at that time. I can remember a moment, sitting in my room on our bed where he used to lie with me, thinking \"This is it\". That this was the thing I had been waiting for, the thing that would finally break me out of the feedback loop of grief that I had been locked in, the thing that would galvanize me into coming back to life and being a person again. I have never been religious or believed in God, but at that time I was certain that God had reached out and given me a gift that would heal my mind. Responsibility, a life to care for, a reason to start eating again, a reason to shower, to come back. I kept waiting to be filled with love for this last piece of him, of us, a love that would wake me up and give me purpose in life again. I kept waiting... but it never came. Nothing changed. I still felt utterly nothing, numb as a stone. I still kept forgetting to eat, I kept losing weight. I was pregnant and dropping pounds every week instead of gaining. Around the 20 week mark I terminated the pregnancy. She was a girl. I don't really remember much of that time either, I have very little memory of anything from that year. I can remember knowing that I couldn't care for her, that I had nothing to give her. I did the only thing I could do for her.\n\nThat was 22 years ago and there is still not a day that goes by that I don't think of her. Our beautiful girl would be 22 now, almost the age I was when I got married, standing at the beginning of her life with the whole world open to her. What would she be like now? What would she be doing? Sometimes I dream about her. I can see her face, see him in her, smiling at me. But I'll never see that face outside of my dreams because I erased her. I carry that with me every day. I could have kept her, I could have kept him alive through her. In reality, I know I'm the one who really killed him. I'm the one who ended the last trace of him and removed him from this world. I know people will disagree with that, but I also know that they're wrong.\n\nI'm still pro choice. Even after everything, my views on that haven't changed. But I desperately regret it. I wish so much that I could have been stronger at that time, that I had been able to carry her into the world. Even if I had been able to carry her far enough to just give her up for adoption, at least she would be out there somewhere, I could at least know that part of him was still in the world. I know that I wasn't capable of it though. It took years before I was even close to okay, I couldn't have cared for her, I couldn't even maintain my own body long enough to sustain her through the pregnancy. I couldn't do it alone, not then anyway.\n\nI'm just sad. I'm filled with regret and guilt and sadness every day. It's on my mind more now because this time of year is when he died, April is always hard but it never really goes away. I think about him all the time, and about her, and about the life that the three of us could have had together. That's all I guess. Just needed to talk about it and don't have anyone here except my cat.\n\nI won't be responding to any messages, I just needed to write it. Thanks for listening.","title":"I terminated my pregnancy and killed the last trace of my husband that was left in the world.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/b71ju7\/i_terminated_my_pregnancy_and_killed_the_last\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false}

I found her number and texted her a brief, factual message that her husband cheated on her, the date we matched on Bumble, how I had no idea he was engaged or married, the fake last name and how he never mentioned her, but did mention other people in his life. I gave her a few screenshots to demonstrate that it went on over a series of months. \n\nShe replied the next day thanking me. She said she was on her way to her parents' house and was planning on filing for divorce as soon as possible. She had been suspicious after testing positive for HPV about a month ago. As I (and you guys) suspected from the house being only in her name, apparently he is completely financially dependent on her and everything he told me about having investments and small businesses is a lie. I also found out that in addition to a fake last name, he gave me a fake phone number too. She cautioned that he may try to retaliate once she gives him the news, and she will message me before she gives him the papers so that I can go to a friend's house for a few days if I feel the need. \n\nIt's been a stressful and emotional past few days. I'm upset that men like this exist. Proud of myself for telling her. Thankful to my friends and to all of you who encouraged me to tell her. Proud of her for leaving him. A little bit scared of what he will do. \n\nTL;DR I told the wife that her husband cheated on her.

Why not rape? Because I kicked the shit out of him *before* it escalated to rape and unwanted touching is technically called battery. Experts who know more about criminally prosecuting this shitstain will fill me in on what all i need to know on the legals of this when they wake up today and get to work and reach out.\n\n3 - Holy shit internets?! How are there so many people who set up their significant others with \"cheating tests\" that theres at least 20+ comments about it? Talk among yourselves about that.\n\n4 - I am fine. Maybe PTSD hasn't set in yet. I'm going to sleep inside of my apartment and enjoy it. Maybe I'll repaint my kitchen or frame the knife (99 cents only store paring (?) knife, cuz I am a fancy bitch). The probability of this situation recurring is low, the guy left in a squad car. The ex is dumped, and later my locks will be changed.

TW: SA, murder, shitty misogynistic regime\/system. !\n\n\n\nI'm sure you've heard of Mahsa Amini on the news or on Twitter or in some hashtag somewhere on social media. \n\nShe was a 22 year old girl who was killed by the Iranian \"morality police\" for having strands of hair out of her hijab.\n\nWell, Mahsa is one of thousands. She is one of millions. Of tens of millions of girls who have been harassed and detained and \"re-educated\" by the morality police for having what they deem improper hijab. She is one of thousands of girls who are imprisoned right now for participating in anti-hijab protests, who have been raped, beaten, coerced, killed and the list goes on. \n\n\n\nJust one other example is 16 year old Nika Shakarami who very vocally participated in the front lines of a protest, chanting anti regime slogans, and burned her hijab. Her aunt, who was participating in the protest with her, last saw her being chased by authorities\u2014 they split up when fleeing. She was missing for a week, until they called her mother and aunt in to identify a corpse. The corpse's nose was smashed, as was her skull (with a baton). Her body was stitched up; her organs were not inside her. Using deductive reasoning looking at the history of the Iranian authorities, poor Nika was most likely raped and tortured for a week before she was killed.  Her family tried to hold a funeral for her in her home city\u2014 on her 17th birthday (she was killed just days before her 17th birthday). The authorities kidnapped her corpse and didn't allow the funeral because it sparked another protest.\n\nThere is so many stories like this but Nika's really hurts me the most. I've cried so much for her beautiful bubbly soul who just wanted a normal life with basic human rights, with the basic freedom she was BORN with.\n\n\n\nThere's so much more misogyny and patriarchal rule. Like how if you get married in Iran and your husband demands sex and you don't want to, he can call the police and they'll come to talk you into having sex with him, how it's your DUTY. If you get r*ped, there is no way for you to find justice, because you're married now, you are his property! Your husband can look for a second wife and commend and prefer the second wife to you if she is more willing for sex.\n\n\nLet me make this clear before someone points it out: we call it a \"woman's revolution\", but men are victims of the Iranian regime, too. Our problem is greater than mandatory hijab and a misogynistic system. Our problem is corruption, government hypocrisy, money laundering by the government, poverty, extreme class differences (there are millionaires driving sports cars living in mansions while there are people who struggle to feed their families bread and water in the SAME CITY, let alone country). Our government ignores the tens of millions of poor Iranians and instead funds foreign armies (Palestine, Lebanon, etc) and spends money on nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nBUT what sparked the final crack that caused what is now becoming a revolution, was the death of an innocent young woman killed for not wanting to wear hijab. This is the Iranian women's revolution. This is the Iranian men's revolution. This is the revolution against misogyny and mandatory hijab. This is the revolution against a murderous, terrorist, corrupt government. \n\n\n\nPlease do not look away. As an Iranian woman, the pain of Mahsa and Nika is MY pain. I AM Mahsa and Nika. I could literally have been either of them. They are my sisters. They are your sisters. Freedom, feminism, and equality is near for us Iranians. But we need your support. And all that is is for you to CARE, you to know what is going on in Iran. That is enough. If you want, participate in protests (there's been a lot of protests outside of Iran for Iran). I recommend joining r\/NewIran (the r\/ Iran and r\/ Iranian subreddit is full of pro-regime scum and propaganda). This post isn't an advertisement for a petition, but if you want to do more to help, just ask and I'll tell you very simple things you can do just from your phone.\n\n\n\nI've always loved how united and understanding women can be towards each other when the time comes. How random girls I've never met in my life will stop in their tracks and come see if I'm safe if I'm with a man and look uncomfortable. Thank you a million times if you've read this far and if you care. Your freedom as a woman is my freedom.","title":"Please don't look away from the women's revolution that is happening in Iran.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/ykw9d4\/please_dont_look_away_from_the_womens_revolution\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":true}

When I arrived, he offered me whisky and wanted to play a drinking game (I had never had alcohol before). The next thing I knew I was naked on the floor of the living room trying to push him off of me while yelling \u201cno\u201d repeatedly. This was how I lost my virginity. \n\nThe next morning, he offered to take me to Planned Parenthood to get plan b.

I left him almost a year later. \n\nMy parents have always been mad and disappointed in what they have perceived as a terrible and reckless decision I made when I was a teenager. I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think and process this year and finally decided this week to tell them exactly what happened that led me down the marriage path with James. It was one of the most healing moments of my life to be able to share what I went through. My parents were shocked and sad and most of all, loving and understanding. I feel lighter already. \n\nTL:DR I had a short marriage at 18 years old to a man that raped me and finally decided to tell my family, who were loving and understanding of what I went through.\n\nEDIT: Holy shit! I just got out of my morning meetings and this has blown up. First of all, thank you all so incredibly much for the love and support. Your kindness is reverberating in me today and I can\u2019t stop wiping the tears from my eyes. The ugliness of the situation itself somehow feels overpowered by the warmth you\u2019re sharing today. Thank you. \n\nSome people asked about what happened afterwards. It took me four years to get the courage to go to therapy and tell my story. This was the first time I was told that I had been raped (prior to this I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what it was). I had also developed an eating disorder and alcohol problem and was using sex as a way of finding control. After a LOT more therapy I found my way to living a happy, healthy, and productive life. I\u2019m single now, but have been able to experience truly loving romantic relationships. Today I am extremely happy, have a fantastic relationship with my friends and family, and continue to find ways to heal and move myself forward. \n\nTo all of you who have experienced what I have: I\u2019m so sorry. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. I feel for you, I love you, I\u2019m here for you. You are important and there is a light at the end the tunnel \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEDIT #2: Thank you all for the comments and DMs. As expected most are incredibly heartwarming and my inbox is open for anyone who wants to talk. \n\nTo those of you who call me dumb\/stupid or doesn\u2019t believe me: May your reaction be more loving to those in your world should they experience the same. \n\nTo those who don\u2019t get why I married my assailant: understanding the brain under trauma is complex and I hope you seek first to understand before jumping to conclusions. \n\nMuch love to all \ud83e\udd70","title":"At 18, I married my rapist.

We were certainly building up to moving in together, until we broke up. \n\nHe worked a lot and because I would stay in the apartment to study and do freelance work during the day, I would also clean up a little. Even though we were both busy working, I didn\u2019t have anywhere to drive. So I would clean his apartment for him once a week(beyond me cleaning up after my own self). It seemed fair because I was there a lot but didn\u2019t pay rent, water, electric, etc. It was also out of love because he toured and had a crazy work schedule, and often came back exhausted. I wanted what little time we had together to actually be spent together instead of him exhausting himself further.\n\nA few days ago he called to see when I could return his apartment key, and I asked how he was feeling with all of my things gone. He said \u201cit feels a lot dirtier for some reason.\u201d \n\nAnd it hit me, he never even noticed that I cleaned, did laundry, vacuumed, cleaned tables, picked up all his empty water bottles, etc. \n\nThey just magically maintained themselves. \n\nWhen I told him why it likely seemed dirtier to him, he was so confused and just went silent.

Second I'm struggling with mild social anxiety and lack confidence greatly. \n\nAnyway, a week after the break up, my friends dragged me to a party. My heart was still in pieces so I wasn't too much in the mood, but I went anyway. I tried my best too have a good time. \n\nThen I spot a man that is just unbelievably handsome. Tall, muscled, gorgeous smile and beautiful face, you know just all over hot. I saw him and my first reaction was \"There's no way a man that handsome would ever want to talk to a girl like me.\" And let me just emphasize that I was not thinking about him taking interest in me or liking me or anything like that... I genuinely thought a guy like him wouldn't want any kind of contact with me. \n\nBut then I fought \"Fuck it. Maybe he does actually... Who am I to suppose what he wants.\" And you know, thinking I didn't have much too loose, I went over and introduced myself. We had a nice little talk, he was really nice and genuinely happy to talk. Then I let him go his way, went my own and enjoyed my night. We talked a couple more time that night and that was that. \n\nBut after that night I figured it would be nice to see him again. I didn't have any hidden intention other than getting to know someone new. So I asked a common friend for his number and, after asking a panel of friends if that would be weird or perceived as an aggression, I sent him a little text that said \"Hey, it's Sabi from the party Saturday... Would like grabbing a coffee sometime ?\" \n\nBefore sending it, my friends asked me if I was ready for him to say no. They asked me if he had a gf or if he was gay and to be fair, I had no idea. But I figured I didn't have much to loose. And I was ready for the fact that he might not want to hang out with me. And I thought that would be okay, that it wouldn't make me anything less as a person. \n\nAfter sending the text, I put the phone down and starting talking with my friends about how the worst would be waiting for his answer and maybe he wouldn't answer at all ? But before the conversation was over my phone lit up and I add a text saying \"Hey :) I would love that actually !\" \n\nAt that point I was ecstatic... I couldn't believe it, the most handsome man ever willing to grab a coffee with me ?? WHAT ? \nWe then arranged to meet the next day in the afternoon... Which was yesterday. And let me just say it went well :)\n It was everything I hopped it would be, an honest, pleasurable chat with a stranger, that lasted just a bit too long (6h!!) to be innocent but totally without any kind of pressure. But the thing I found out, the whole point of that story and what really blew my mind is how insecure that man is. He doesn't even see himself as handsome !!! Actually, the most handsome man I ever saw probably couldn't believe that a girl like *me* just texted him out of the blue... \n\nSo this whole things got me thinking about how we perceive ourselves and other people... How we *think* other people perceive us. Maybe it's time to stop being so hard on ourselves, and wary of other people... \n\nEdit : For the people wondering, even though it's not really the point of the story, I'm a 26y\/o French girl... You people all warmed my heart, you're awesome, and I'm really sorry for the couple grumpy people that seems to still be struggling big time with their insecurities. You'll get there and we love you :)","title":"I asked out the most handsome man ever, just to see what would happen...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/84da4e\/i_asked_out_the_most_handsome_man_ever_just_to\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

First of all he had no idea any of the Supreme Court stuff was going on. When I tried my best to explain it he said abortion should be illegal. I asked a few prodding questions like what about rape? Incest? Medical necessity? \"Well obviously that would be okay. But if you do it just because you don't want a kid then it's wrong. Like if you aborted my baby for no reason I'd have to kill you, ya know?\" I was flabbergasted, to clarify it wasn't like a threat, I'd like to think it was more to emphasize his point. I asked what about if a guy get a girl pregnant then abandons her? \"He didn't force her to have sex with him then she has to have the baby\" also something to the effect of that hardly ever happens (he has a good group of friends that have actually stepped up as dads so maybe that's just his perspective) I said but if it's my body it should be my choice, his response was \"once you're pregnant it's not just your body anymore\". I guess I'm just processing it all. I've always known we had different views on things. We're probably opposite sides of the political spectrum and I've been able to overlook it for the most part because he's a good guy but I'm not sure I can get over this one. I've had two abortions that he wouldn't agree with (before I met him) and I didn't have the heart to tell him about it. I don't think he would've listened anyway.

I\u2019d previously lived in North Dakota, so I assumed it was just the weather. The second day, I felt kinda worse, but again it was probably just the weather. Third day, it was getting really annoying now. So I took painkillers for a whole week. I was always in this slightly dizzy state, but I attributed it to like a flu or something.\n\nThen the day after the first week, I wake up to an intense headache, and think I'm gonna die. I drive myself to Bellavue hospital and  I had an 105 fever. The doctor on duty immediately spotted that it was measles. Ok... MEASLES?? WHAT THE FRICK.\n\nWell, yada yada yada, after the hospital did their medical stuff and prevented me from DYING, about a week later I was at a point where I could go out and do stuff, and not feel like death. But I never really recovered until like a year or 2 later. During that time, I kept getting sick because apparently measles completely ruins your immune system for awhile.\n\nAnd now here I am alive, 2 years later. **Completely** up to date with vaccines.

It was the summer before my senior year. My high school boyfriend and I used the never reliable pull out method. I remember one day none of my clothes fit properly and it dawned on me that I was way more bloated than usual. \n\nBefore taking a pregnancy test my boyfriend and I talked at length about what to do. He was 3 years older than me but lived at my house in his own room because his parents were shitty. We decided to keep the baby and make the best of it.\n\nAs soon as I saw the positive I was sick to my stomach and absolutely didn\u2019t want this baby anymore. The fantasy sounded great but the reality of being 17 and pregnant terrified me.\n\nMy mom came home from work and I remember asking her to come upstairs with me so I could show her the test I took. I was crying and embarrassed. She didn\u2019t believe it, convinced it was a false positive and made me an appointment with her OBGYN who actually delivered me and my little sister.\n\nThe OB confirmed I was 5 weeks pregnant. The nurse congratulated me- I didn\u2019t know how to respond. After the sonogram I sat in the doctor\u2019s office to discuss the next steps. He said I should come back for my next appointment in a month but then he asked if I wanted this baby. I shamefully told him I didn\u2019t know. He asked if I thought about an abortion. He told me he could recommend a great women\u2019s clinic and that physically I would be totally fine afterwards and could still have children later (I didn\u2019t have any accurate education about abortion at the time). I immediately said that\u2019s what I want. \n\nNow, I live in GA and was raised Lutheran. I went to a small private school from age 3-8th grade. My mom is religious and thought it important that I be raised in the church. She never really pushed religion once I got old enough to make my own decisions and we never talked about what she thought of abortion. I assumed she believed it was murder.\n\nI told her I wanted an abortion. She told me I had to call the women\u2019s clinic and make the appointment. My boyfriend was pissed. I don\u2019t think he ever forgave me for my decision even though we stayed together for about 2 years after. He refused to go with me.\n\nMy mom took me to the clinic on the day of. We passed by protestors with signs of fetuses. We had to show our IDs to a security guard to prove we were supposed to be there.  There were so many other women there- the waiting room was packed. I checked in and insurance paid for about $400 worth. My mom paid for the rest. She sat in that waiting room for 8 hours while I went back, was interrogated about if I really wanted to do this, and forced to hear the heart beat. My mom helped me to the car after the procedure and after I came to, took me home and took care of me. We really never talked about it again.\n\nI am now married to someone wonderful and we just had a baby of our own. Our son is 12 weeks old and all I can think about is how thankful I am that my life worked out this way.\n\nI am so thankful for that older male OBGYN in GA that didn\u2019t judge me and referred me to a safe clinic. I\u2019m thankful there was a clinic near me. I\u2019m thankful insurance covered part of it. I\u2019m thankful my mom was supportive and could afford to pay for the rest of it. I had easy access to a safe abortion. It corrected a mistake that would have changed my life and gave me a better chance to succeed.\n\nI will never stop fighting for women to have access to birth control, education, and safe abortions.\n","title":"I had an abortion at 17 and I am so thankful.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/9sgj3p\/i_had_an_abortion_at_17_and_i_am_so_thankful\/","upvote_ratio":0.68,"over_18":false}

It has remained open during the pandemic with many restrictions. \n\nEdit: I live in America. As others have pointed out to me, this conversation would be different if I lived somewhere else. I\u2019m sorry for not making this clear earlier.\n\nLast week, I was getting ready to sub for a teacher who would be off for a few days. As she was preparing me to take over her class that consisted of 2-3 year olds, she told me about behavioral problems that come up a lot during the school day. \n\nShe informed me that a little boy had made a habit of looking up a certain little girl\u2019s dress when he could. (Side note: 2 year old boys aren\u2019t naturally inclined to do this by any means. This is learned behavior) She said that if he kept doing it, I should put shorts on under her dress.\n\nInstead of telling him to stop, I should just cover her up. What is this teaching her? That when boys do stuff like this, it\u2019s because you need to cover up more? Absolutely not. So when the time came for me to sub in the classroom and he tried to look up her skirt, I pulled him aside and explained that we *never* do that. When his mom came to pick him up later that day, I informed her of what was happening and she proceeded to tell him the same thing. \n\nSince then, much to his teacher\u2019s surprise, he hasn\u2019t tried to look up her skirt again. If I had decided to do as she said and put shorts on under the little girl\u2019s dress, there\u2019s a good chance he would still be doing it. \n\nWe need to teach young boys that behavior like this is not ok, and will not be tolerated. Instead, we continue to teach young girls that it is not only their fault, but also their responsibility to stop it. Whether it is putting shorts on under a 2 year old\u2019s dress or making a female student put on a sweater because she wore a tank top to school, it\u2019s all harmful to both boys and girls.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t not expect this post to blow up like it did. Thank you for all the kind words and awards.\n\nI do want to clarify that I am not sexualizing this little boys behavior, nor am I saying he had malicious intent. This is why I explained to him that it\u2019s not ok (and don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t yell or be rude), and so did his mother.","title":"Teach boys how to control themselves instead of teaching girls they need to cover up","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/i84fw9\/teach_boys_how_to_control_themselves_instead_of\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false}

A couple hours later he came in the bedroom and announced he ran the dishwasher because the dirty dishes stunk (normally I would have run it last night and it was now almost 24 hours later - ewww david). He asked if I was boycotting that, too. \u201cWell, like I said, since you do everything around here, I figured you had it under control.\u201d\nHe left all the non dishwasher stuff on the counter.\nHe said I was brutal, I said yep I sure am.\nI went about my skincare routine and went to bed a little after him. He leaned over to drink some water and guess what, no water! In the 16 years we\u2019ve lived together, he hasn\u2019t done that particular \u201cchore\u201d ONCE. I told him that shit doesn\u2019t just happen by magic and turned off the light.\n\nI fucking hate being this petty and I don\u2019t really like myself very much right now. I finally opened up to a friend this afternoon; she has been through a divorce and had some good advice. I think my next step is to get an appt with a therapist, get my head on straight and figure out my next next step.\n\nI\u2019m working 9 to 7 tomorrow, I wonder what will be waiting for me when I get home.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nYesterday we had a huge fight about household chores. Yep, another post about one person carrying the household on their back and the other just living their best life but still somehow complaining they have to do everything.\n\nMy husband helps with laundry every Saturday and empties the dishwasher AT BEST once a week. That\u2019s it. Last night he got pissed while he was drinking and decided to go clean his toilet and bathroom floor at like 10 at night with the \u201cwoe is me I can\u2019t believe I had to do this\u201d atitude and he kept arguing with me from the bathroom. I told him that just because he cleans his pissy bathroom once every three months that doesn\u2019t make him fucking Cinderella.\n\nI feel kind of childish but him saying that he has to do everything around the house got me seeing red. I went to bed without washing the dishes or clearing the kitchen at all. This morning I woke up, got my breakfast, did not touch the dishes. Got my coffee and sat in front of my computer, caught up on my shows and played my games. When I was done eating breakfast, I took my dishes in the kitchen (was feeling generous) and I just put them on the counter and left them there. I\u2019m not going to do those dishes and I\u2019m not cooking dinner. I\u2019m just gonna do what he does every single day, do whatever I feel like doing and then either ask what\u2019s for dinner or just show up to dinner when it\u2019s time. Of course there will be no dinner, but still.\n\nWe have sat down and had conversations about this several times. \u201cI bet my father never had to clean the bathroom\u201d is the kind of response I usually get from him.\n\nI thought about making a new account to post this with but then I thought, fuck that, I have nothing to be embarrassed about. I am a grown ass person, and I did nothing wrong. \n\nExcept maybe not standing my ground sooner.\nThis is such bullshit.","title":"I\u2019m currently living like my husband does","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/142omoe\/im_currently_living_like_my_husband_does\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

As a teenager, there were alot of things I've learned that I thought was true, only to realize it isn't.\nI wanted to make a post to share things I've learned over the years, and debunk myths.\nThis is mostly aimed at teenage girls\/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.\n\nIf you have anything you want to add, feel free to do so in the comments!\n\n\n**PEE AFTER SEX**\nPeeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**\nPeople make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.\nBut I'm happy to say, it's not!\nIt's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.\nDon't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. \nIf it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Your vagina is self-cleaning**\nVaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. \nThe vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.\nUsing water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**\nThe vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**\nThe optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. \nSemen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.\nBecause of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.\nIf you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.\nThe best way to deal with this is using a condom.\n\nEDIT:\nLubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.\nMany popular brands of lube\/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.\n\n- If a product is CE marked, it\u2019s a confirmation that it\u2019s safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there\u2019s no confirmation that your lube product doesn\u2019t contain anything that\u2019s harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.\n- Avoid lubes\/condoms that have flavors\/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.\n- Avoid:\u00a0Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars & Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.\n\nThank you u\/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!\nHere's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http:\/\/dangerouslilly.com\/lube-guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**\nCan't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!\nThe vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!\nDon't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.\nYour pleasure is just as important as theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Most women don't bleed their first time**\nIn some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.\nOnly 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.\nBleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.\nQuick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her \"virginity\" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**\nThere have been cases of people taking their girlfriends\/daughters\/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.\nLike the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.\nThe truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.\nThe hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.\nPlease don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.\nThere's help out there for women who need to prove their \"virginity\" to their boyfriend\/father\/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.\nVirginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.\n\nEDIT:\nThank you u\/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:\n\n\"While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped\/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged\/intoxicated\/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.\"\n\nThis is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having large labia minora is normal**\nLabiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is \"abnormal\".\nIt isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a \"right\" way for a vulva to look. \nThere's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.\nPlease be safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**\nIt's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!\nThat being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That\u2019s especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening,\u00a0dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**You can get pregnant during your period**\nIt's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.\nOnce inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**The vagina does not become \"loose\" if you have alot of sex**\nEver wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a \"loose\" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!\nThis is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. \nVirginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.\nThe vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**\nI had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.\nMy mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.\nShe explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.\nThere's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**\nThis annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.\nThis is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.\nTo clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.\nSex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.\n\n\n\n\n**Vaginal discharge 101**\nI used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https:\/\/youtu.be\/KHF8mB_8LUM)\n\nDischarge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.\nYour vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.\nSome of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.\nI do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. \n\n**Healthy\/Normal discharge**\nThe color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.\n[Here] (https:\/\/pasteboard.co\/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.\n\n*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:\n\n- Watery\/Clear\n\n- Gel-like \"stringy\" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.\n\n- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.\n\nYour discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https:\/\/pasteboard.co\/JZHDEfo.jpg)\nThis is called spotting.\nSpotting\u00a0is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.\nThis kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.\n\n**Abnormal discharge**\nFirst of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.\n\nCottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https:\/\/pasteboard.co\/JZHlZIV.jpg)\n\nThis can often signify a yeast infection.\nEspecially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:\n\n- Genital Itching \n\n- Swelling\n\n- Redness \n\n- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex\n\n- Your discharge might smell a little \"off\" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.\n\n\nTREATMENT:\nIf it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.\n\nOtherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)\nIf your symptoms persists, book an appointment.\n\nDon't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.\n\nTo reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: \n\n- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.\n\nAvoid:\n\n- Tight-fitting pantyhose\n\n- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection\n\n- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons\n\nThe following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:\n- Stress\n\n- Diabetes\n\n- Use of birth control pills\n\n- Pregnancy\n\n- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days\n\n\n\n\nAlot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https:\/\/pasteboard.co\/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.\nA slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.\nRemember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.\nThat's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.\n\nLime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]\n(https:\/\/pasteboard.co\/JZHvzad.jpg)\nAnd [here] (https:\/\/pasteboard.co\/JZHvNlq.jpg)\nIf you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.\n\nSymptoms of\u00a0trichomoniasis:\n- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals\n\n-Discomfort with urination\n\n-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell\n\nSymptoms of gonorrhea:\n- an unusual\u00a0vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery\u00a0and green or yellow in colour\n\n- Pain\u00a0or a burning sensation when peeing\n\n- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)\n\n- Bleeding between\u00a0periods,\u00a0heavier periods\u00a0and bleeding after sex\u00a0(this is less common)\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.\n\nIf your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.\n\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\nBacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Grey-like discharge\n\n-Discharge have a strong fishy odor\n\n- Burning feeling when you pee\n\n- Itching\n\n50% of women do not have any symptoms.\n\nWhen to see a doctor:\n\n-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.\n\n- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.\n\n- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.\n\n- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**\nTSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.\nThis can affect both men, women and children.\nRisk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.\nHaving your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.\n\nSymptoms:\nThe symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get\u00a0worse quickly. They include:\n\n- A high temperature\n\n- Flu-like symptoms, such as a\u00a0headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a\u00a0sore throat\u00a0and a\u00a0cough\n\n- Feeling and being sick\n\n- Diarrhoea\n\n- A\u00a0widespread sunburn-like rash\n\n- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red\n\n- Dizziness\u00a0or\u00a0fainting\n\n- Difficulty breathing\n\n- Confusion\n\nTSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.\n\n\n\nLike I said, feel free to add anything if I forgot about something.\n\nI hope you all have an amazing day!\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you so much for the awards and positive comments. \nYour comments warms my heart, I'm so glad that many of you have found it helpful.\n\nSeeing that many parents show their daughters and sons my post makes me so incredibly proud of myself, you have no idea how much it means to me.\n\n\nI'm happy that many women and girls are comfortable  enough to DM me with questions about their body, questions that they're afraid to ask in real life.\nI'm very happy to answer questions to the best of my ability, but please remember that I'm not a medical professional.","title":"THINGS EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HER BODY","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/n0d1sk\/things_every_woman_should_know_about_her_body\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

DM's are off, don't waste time with the RedditCares, boys.\n\nMiddle aged woman, US based. I was selected to sit on the jury for a rape case last week.\n\nI take doing jury duty extremely seriously.  It is a very important civic duty and I don't complain about being called to serve. I served on a jury in a death penalty case in the past. I did not want to serve on this particular jury when I heard what it involved, but I was selected.\n\nThe defendant and the victim were both teenagers at the time of the incident; the defendant was being tried as an adult (three years later). No physical evidence, only the testimony of the two individuals involved and three police officers involved in the investigation(s) There were other things involved that we didn't get to hear about; one was brought up and the defense attorney threw a huge fit and got it struck from the record, others were alluded to but never fleshed out.\n\nWe had to decide based solely on our own interpretations of the stories and credibility of the witnesses.\n\nI listened very carefully, without bias, to all of the testimony. I made my decision only after hearing all of the judge's instructions and then spending that night (sleeping very little) considering everything.\n\nMy decision? He raped her and he did it forcefully. She told him she did not want to have sex - repeatedly, before he did it and while he was doing it. She was stuffed into the corner of a back seat of a small coupe with a body much larger than hers on top of her. She couldn't get away. He raped her until finally he listened to her, stopped and took her home.\n\nI was the only one of 12 who voted guilty.  And I got abused for it. I was accused of ignoring the judges' instructions, that I had made my mind up before the defendant even testified. One (very) old man told me that I had to vote not guilty because everyone else had reasonable doubt (senile much????). Another old man talked over me every time I spoke. Several other people interrupted while I was trying to make points (if the one old dude wasn't already talking over me). Most of them couldn't understood that force does not have to include violence or even the threat of violence. Two of the WOMEN even insisted that her getting into the back seat of the car was consent, didn't matter that she  repeatedly told him that she did not want to have sex.\n\nSurprisingly enough, I held my temper. I didn't yell. I didn't use personal attacks in any of my arguments, despite being attacked repeatedly (I had a whole list of names I wanted to call them in my head).  I very quietly and firmly told them I did not appreciate how they were acting and that I was not going to continue to discuss this if they could not do so as adults.\n\nThey could not. The old men continued their antics, but I worked for years in male dominated industries. I'm not a doormat. I stopped being a people pleaser a long time ago. IDGAF what they think about me. I knew I was right. I stood my ground.\n\nThe jury foreperson sent a note to the judge.\n\nThe judge made us come back after a lunch break and continue deliberating. We listened to a reading of the testimony again. I listened intently, with an open mind, trying to catch anything that might give me some reasonable doubt.\n\nMy decision was not changed. We attempted to discuss it further and it was obvious that they weren't going to walk over me like they were the other women on the panel.  We went back to the courtroom and the judge declared a mistrial.\n\nAfterwards, I spoke to someone from the DA's office. I told her everything, including the fact that I had strongly considered not coming back from lunch that day. Then I walked out to my truck and stood there smoking a cigarette. I needed some time to settle down before driving home.\n\nA few minutes later a couple walked over to me.  It was the victim's parents. The DA had told them who I was and what I had done (I had said I was okay with talking to them). The woman asked if she could hug me and told me I was her angel.\n\nBecause I believed their daughter.\n\nI hugged both of them and we all cried a few tears.\n\nAnd then they told me what we weren't allowed to hear. There are three other girls that POS raped. None of them would testify. He had locked one of them in a basement for three days. He had already been tried in juvenile court and gotten a plea bargain and refused to turn himself in over the past three years since he raped her.\n\nI wish I could be a fly on the wall if\/when the other jurors discover that information.  Because even though I did what was right, it's going to haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\nSo yeah, that's it. I hung that jury. And today there's a teenage girl who knows that someone believed her.\n\nAnd that alone made the whole experience worthwhile.\n\nEDIT TO ADD -\n\nSince so many have asked, I won't give exact details as to what made me not believe him (public forum, privacy). There were several things in his story that were inconsistent with what, from what my young friends have told me, a teenage boy would do during consensual sex.

She told him \u201cStop\u201d and when that didn\u2019t work she told him to move over (which also didn\u2019t change his behavior.)\n\nI found out about it after she had already told her older sister (she\u2019s 9).  Her sister told her, \u201cI would march right up to my teacher and tell her I don\u2019t like it when he touches me!\u201d\n\nWhen she told me her plan to talk to her teacher, I asked if she wanted me to come with or if she felt comfortable saying it on her own.  She wanted me to come, so we went together.  (Just as a Covid aside: I work at my school.  Parents are not allowed on campus right now).\n\nThe teacher squatted down and looked her in the eyes.  She took what she said seriously and, best of all, did not downplay her discomfort in the situation.

But for real, thank you for your overwhelmingly positive responses to this, especially towards his actions of trying to right a wrong. It's also been overwhelming to read how many people have experienced varying degrees of sexual assault in their lives, but at least we all have this reminder that we're not in this alone, despite what it often feels like. You're all amazingly strong. <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if stuff like this is allowed here, but I needed somewhere to process this and share this with other women who might see how incredible this is.\n\nWhen I was 16\/17 (I'm 27 now) I dated a boy in my high school. He was pretty much my first everything for sexual experiences. I was raised in a very conservative and religious household, so a lot of the stuff we ended up doing took a lot of pressuring on his part. It was never forceful, but it was pressure, it caused me a lot of stress at the time, and really changed how I viewed my worth based on my sexuality.\n\nHonestly, I haven't really thought about that portion of our relationship in years with the exception of it occasionally coming up as a contributing factor in other problems during therapy. He and I remained friendly over the years, but never talked about anything serious or even more than the occasional comment on someone's Facebook post.\n\nToday he messaged me out of the blue. It was long and I could tell he put a lot of thought into it.  He basically stated that due to the passing of time\/aging\/and now working as a victim advocate for survivors of violent crimes for our state, he has been reflecting on his past behavior and has felt really guilty for it. He apologized for bringing it up and also for waiting 11 years to apologize for pressuring me into things. He said basically he wasn't sure how I saw it, but from where he stood he was in the wrong and he felt awful about being \"that person\" in my life.\n\nI was completely blown away. Not only because I hadn't expected this now or ever, but because I don't think I realized until that moment how much I needed that. Also, that was a really brave thing he did. It's been 11 years, he didn't have to apologize ever. He didn't even have to think about it if he didn't want to. But he did, and he brought it up to me, and he apologized for his behavior like a man. To top that all off, it really let me put other things in perspective. For example, if pressure \"wasn't a big deal\", then maybe feeling trapped or feeling unable to say no to other guys wasn't either. The fact that he was completely owning what he did and refusing to mitigate it, which pales in comparison to what other exes did, really shines a light on how serious the \"little stuff\" is.\n\nI don't know. I feel like I'm rambling now, but it gave me a new respect for him and lifted my standards of what men can do when they decide to own their stuff and be accountable. Never in a million years did I think I'd see this day. It's bittersweet in a way, but I'm glad it happened and I hope it gives us both more peace.\n\nThat's all. Thanks for reading. <3","title":"My boyfriend from high school messaged me out of the blue today to apologize for pressuring me into sexual situations when we were 16.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/gipkyg\/my_boyfriend_from_high_school_messaged_me_out_of\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false}

I just got home and I will be trying to respond as best I can. Thank you everyone for the kind words, and for those who are confused about why I am getting my tubes tied as a response to bad periods, it is also an endometrial ablation, which will stop the bleeding. \n\nLong story incoming, but it has a happy ending, I swear. TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nI am 23 years old, I have been menstruating since I was 11, and it has never, ever been regular or normal. Periods would last for weeks or even months on end. I didn't have health insurance growing up, so this was never looked at and I had to just ignore it. The worst part was I knew even at 10 I never wanted to be a mother. It felt like just a punishment to me. \n\nAt 16, I met my boyfriend - now husband - and I knew he was something special. Seven months into our relationship, we wanted to finally have sex. I told my mom, who had my older brother at 19, and she immediately drove me to Planned Parenthood. I had Implanon put in my arm, and we were good to go. (Before the age topic comes up, the age of consent in our area is 16; every single thing we ever did was my choice and my choice alone. He always made me choose what we did.)\n\nExcept I bled for 11 months solid. \n\nI eventually had to pay almost $1,000 to get it removed from my arm, begging for it to go away. The anxiety, stress, depression, bleeding, it was all too much. \n\nNow, my boyfriend is a bit older than me and he made a decision at that point to get a vasectomy, even with how young he was. His family has a series of medical issues that he doesn't want to see kids have, the both of didn't want kids, and we knew if we changed our minds, morally, it was better to adopt. The doctor let him do this without question. Literally. He made the appointment, got snipped, and that was that. Under the age of 25. \n\nFast forward to now, I've been hopping between doctor to doctor for any help because my periods still would never stop. They'd go away for a few months, then come back with a vengeance. I knew it was PCOS, and almost all the women in my family have had to get a  hysterectomy for it. I was begging for it and my story was always the same: I don't want kids, I've made this choice since I was 10, and I am not changing my mind. No one listened. All the doctors would just prescribe a new birth control, then send me on my way. It was killing me. \n\nNow, thankfully, I work for a state institution and have fantastic health insurance. I, also, have an amazing coworker who recommended I look into Endometrial Ablation. We had a specialty clinic for it even in our town. \n\nI called on Tuesday for the appointment and the nurse scheduled me on Wednesday, next day, due to a cancelation. I was excited. I read all the information on it I could and I was jumping for joy that this might be the solution I need. \n\nCome Wednesday, I go. The nurses, everyone, they're great. I sit down, I get comfortable, and the doctor comes in. Doesn't introduce himself.\n\n\"You're 23 and you don't have kids!\"\n\nInsert the first hour of him trying to tell me how he isn't going to do this because of my age and lack of children. Except he saw I was married and asked about my husband's opinion. \n\nI explained the above and that he had a vasectomy. \n\nThe doctor mulled that over, then sent me to get an ultrasound so they could check things. Shortly after, he invites me back to his office for a consultation. \n\nHis words were, \"You're going to make me bend my rules for two reasons: Your situation warrants it and your husband had a vasectomy.\"\n\nI didn't let my anger show then, I thanked him and scheduled the procedure. They asked when, I said as soon as possible, and today, less than 48 hours after calling the office, I will be getting an endometrial ablation and my tubes tied. \n\nI am thankful he bent his rule, but the absurdity of not being able to make my own decisions as a woman who has spent over half of her teenage and young adult life bleeding out of her vagina, I believe I should get to make the choice that is going to improve the quality of my entire life. \n\nTL;DR - Grow up with terrible, neverending periods. First boyfriend\/now husband gets a vasectomy so I don't need to be on hormonal birth control. Things get worse, I go to a specialist for endometrial ablation and the doctor only agrees to do the procedure because my husband had the vasectomy, not my opinion or choices whatsoever.","title":"In two hours, I'll be getting my tubes tied at 23 with no kids.

You are every bit as smart and strong and capable as any boy out there.\"\n\nHe held the scorpions tail  with his fingers and held it in the palm of his hand. She started to look more and more confident and brave as she stood there with him. \n\n He  explained to her that as she grows up people are always going to try to tell her what she can and cannot do, but that she can do anything if she puts her heart and mind into it. He told her there are women that work with bugs for their jobs and study them. She got so excited at the thought of a woman being able to do things a man can do. \n\nAt this point her little sister has worked her way over to look at it too. So he sits there and explains the different parts of it and what they're for. Completely captured their imaginations.\n\nThe oldest girl asked if she could hold it. So he put it on her hands while he held the pinches and the tail and she held the scorpion in her hands. She was so proud of herself she talked about it until she went to sleep. \n\nI'm pregnant so it just makes me proud that our daughter, if we have a girl, will grow up with a father that believes in her.\n\n\nEdit: I just looked at the up votes and it's over 9000!!!!!!! \n\n**Edit2: I seriously never imagined this story would get so much attention.

Gambling on the streets, being a scam artist. The list continues. \n\nLast year, a girl in their small town disappeared. He was the last one seen with her as they left the little family owned market they worked at together. She was never seen again. Her family often requests news stations post her photos, begging for tips or ideas on where to find her. He says he dropped her off at the end of her street and she said she'd walk home. They deny her ever coming home as expected that night. I cry for them, because deep inside we know he did something to her. Of course, it's a town with a population of ~700 and just as astonishingly poor and rampant with drug and alcohol abuse. The store has no security cameras. There's no proof he was with her. That he did something to her. But I know he did.\n\nMy uncle desperately hangs onto him still, letting him crash on his couch and giving him money for \"food\" (he knows his son uses the money for drugs and\/or alcohol). Invites him to the family parties he throws. My cousin's behavior and pattern of destruction caused a divorce between him & his wife, my now ex-aunt. She has given up on her son. He just can't seem to accept the fact that he's a monster.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I feel for my uncle. It was wrong of him to deny what his son did to me, but I can't even imagine the confusion and suffering of hearing the child you raised has the potential of harming another human being. That pain must hit deep inside. I pray my uncle finds peace, accepts he was a good dad to him when he was a kid, and it's not his fault his son turned out to be a monster. Sometimes, no matter how well they're raised, or how loved they are, people just turn out to be evil. I pray my uncle comes to terms with the fact that his kid did do damage. I pray he seeks help to cope with this whole matter. I also hope my uncle apologizes to me and admits he was wrong, but that's a whole other messy thing. I pray that time will come. \n\nI received a call from my dad today while in class. He never calls me, so I knew it was something big. He told me to look up my uncle's Facebook page - it's not private at all, so I could see his posts. He posted a woefully written update about the tragic death of his son. How he went to check on him at the trap house he knows he stays at four and a half weeks ago, and how he found him dead. Already dead for three days, the autopsy report later confirmed. Needle still in his arm. He overdosed on heroine, which turned out to be tainted with Fentanyl. The Midwest is having a true epidemic of these cases lately, and it's not uncommon to hear about ODs daily. \n\nI cried. I cried happy tears. He is dead. He is fucking dead. No longer will he terrorize women, fight men that try to better him, steal from people, abuse people, ruin property, vandalize, ignore all authority, rape and impregnate, threaten to harm, potentially fucking murder, and just in general wreak total havoc. He is fucking dead and he cannot harm another soul. \n\nI have received many years of therapy for what happened to me. I have accepted it wasn't my fault, and although it hurt me it can't and WON'T control my future. My life is still mine to decide what happens... but I would be lying if I said all of these years I wasn't scared he would come back to hurt me again, hurt my little sister, or anyone else on this planet. He was a terror. I felt like I just had to watch a monster destroying anything it touched for two decades. Before therapy, I felt it was all my fault. I felt so guilty. I now understand it was nobody's fault but his. \n\nHe made his choices. He continuously hurt people - innocent people, and the people that loved him and tried to get him help. He chose to use drugs. He chose to shoot up that day, and it just happened to be his last choice. \n\nHe's finally dead, and I am so fucking happy. \n\nThe world is a better place without him in it.

Due to an ineffective lockdown he had it all winter, we didn't meet all those months. \n\nNow the weather is really nice and I walked in long jeans and a tshirt along the street, enjoying the sun. I crossed the street, then I heard a car honking. I ignored it. It honked again. I ignored it again. Again honking, and without looking behind me I just raised my middle finger in the general direction of the honker and continued walking. Then I heard a car slowing down next to me. I apruply turned 180\u00b0 around, walking where I came from. \n\nThen I heard a familiar voice shouting \"Hey, (my name), what's up with you?\". It was my friend in that car. I walked back and greeted him. Upon asking why I reacted like I did, I anwered: \"Do you have ANY idea how many cars honk at me? If I reacted to every single one of them, I'd do nothing else!\" He took a closer look at my clothes (not too tight, not really lose, just plain casual clothing. No suggestive skin showing, nothing) and I could see he doubted. \nHe changed topic and grabbed my ice scraper from the passenger seat. \"Hey, finally I can give it back!\" I leaned forward to take it, in that moment a car with some guys in it drove past. They honked, shouted \"Hey! Can you make me an offer too?\" and drove off with an awful loud engine. I showed absolutely no reaction, my friend was flabbergasted. \"Did that just really happen?\" I said: \"Well, that's just standard stuff that I hear every other day.\" \n\nHe was completely shocked and disgusted. He apologized for honking at me at first and said he'd just call me next time or just walk up to me. \n\nLater he told me (about 3 hours after the incident) that he can't just stop thinking about what happened and that he wants to ask his coworkers at lunch break if they ever experienced something like that.\n\nThis is it for now, maybe I'll update in the comments what his coworkers say.\n\nThx for reading until here, I hope you feel as good as me for opening someone's eyes to this bullshittery.\nHave a nice day y'all!","title":"Today my male friend learned what it means to be a girl outside","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/m0bpdk\/today_my_male_friend_learned_what_it_means_to_be\/","upvote_ratio":0.82,"over_18":false}

It was a lovely day with spring in full bloom, and there were dogwoods, redbuds, bluebells, creeks and birds everywhere.

Not two bites in, this creepy, bald, tannish, babyfaced guy in his 60's backs his white truck in right next to me, despite spaces all around, and starts eyeing me. Of course. So I pull out and drive a few dozen yards down to the next empty bank of spots, and try to resume eating. He pulls away after I pull away, and then another two trucks full of guys pull in right on either side of me in my new spot. Same shit. I'm getting pissed off, and my food is getting cold. So once again, I pull out and drive back towards the north end of the woods where I first came in and park there, no one around. Hey! Here comes bald, white-truck guy again. Backs in about three spaces to my left and proceeds to watch me. By this point I try putting my visor down and over and my left hand up to block my face. He pulls away, but slows to a near stop *directly behind my car* and does the blank male gaze stare at me, through my rear view mirror, which *I* return with an expression of consternation. *The fuck*. He drives off, menacingly slow of course, I'm trying to finally finish my food and listen to some music. \n\nOk.

Dunno, probably just this: if you think that you are being followed or that something is wrong, don\u2019t wait to see what happen, call the police, call a friend, a family member, knock on a door or get into a shop, worst case scenario you\u2019ll look a bit paranoid.\n\n2 She was carrying some sort of briefcase alongside her purse and was well dressed, I think that the briefcase was what called those guys attention .\n\n3 They seemed to be waiting for an opportunity, that was the main reason why I didn\u2019t approached, I was afraid that I would sort of trigger them and offer a second target (still, probably wrong on my side, but in the moment that's what I thought).\n\n4 I called the police because if those guys were trying to assault her, more than likely it wasn\u2019t the first time and \/ or they would go for another victim, if it was a mistake worst case scenario they spent 10 mins talking to the police (no idea if they caught them).\n\n5 I parked my car in the dead end street and was walking towards the city centre, she was coming from the city centre, obviously I didn\u2019t know where she was heading, if instead of turning to the dead end street she had continued walking I would had probably approach her, or she would had reach another street that has more traffic and there are more people walking around.\n\nFor the ones wanting to know where this happened:\n\n[https:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/maps\/dir\/54.5978716,-5.9353879\/54.5969477,-5.9409572\/@54.5973025,-5.9393942,17.75z?hl=en](https:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/maps\/dir\/54.5978716,-5.9353879\/54.5969477,-5.9409572\/@54.5973025,-5.9393942,17.75z?hl=en)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal EDIT:\n\n1 For some reason I can't see any new replies from the last 8 or 9 hours, I have seen some of them in the notification's bar in my phone but not all the text is showed and I can't reply from there (and I wanted to reply to some of them) and this is the reason for a final edit.\n\n2 To the people that think this is BS: I whish it was, you don't have to believe me and in fact I don mind, just do yourself a favor and be safe out there (regardless of your gender)\n\n3 I think that someone asked for the police report: REALLY??? Do you expect from me to upload a document with my personal information just so you can \"believe me\"?\n\n4 To clarify what happened: I saw the two guys gesturing only a couple of seconds before I crossed the girl and I kept walking a bit trying to decide what to do (turn around?, keep walking?, shout at her?, shout at them?) I deceided to follow her just in case, I didn't know what the guys intentions were (if any) or even if they knew her, but the constant glances at her and finaly the fact that they stayed in the corner (entrance) to the dead end street and the way they looked at her when she passed by in her car was what made me call the police (also, don't forget that I was in that same f\\*\\*\\*\\* street and to go back to the city centre I would have had to walk by them).\n\n4.1 Adendum: Northern Ireland is part of te UK, not ROI (Republic Of Ireland) and here we call the police \"the police\"\n\n5 Was my decision the best one? most likely not, but it's what I did and no one was hurt (beyond being scared, that is). Now that it passed and reviewing the situation (alongside with some of the comments here) if anything similar happens again I would try to approach the person and explain the situation, or even maybe call the cops straight away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for your advices, skepticism, humor and good whishes, be safe out there and never be affraid of looking foolish if that will keep you safe (asking someone else for help, knocking on a house, going into a shop or even stop a passing car)","title":"To the girl that I followed today for almost four blocks to her car","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/9x71dn\/to_the_girl_that_i_followed_today_for_almost_four\/","upvote_ratio":0.77,"over_18":false}

I was 36 at the time, in full possession of all my faculties, well-spoken, educated, and not in enough pain to derail my composure. I explained to the ER staff that I believed my appendix to be the problem, they took my vitals, blood, and urine and put me on a stretcher-bed in a shared triage room with a bunch of other patients and their companions. This room was way off the beaten path and no nurses or other staff were nearby. The other patients were mostly sleeping since it was very late at night. \n\nAfter two hours passed, I walked\/shuffled over to the nurses station and asked if I would be seen soon. They didn't seem pressed to make it happen, but about 45 minutes later a female PA came in and interviewed me...about my menstrual cycle and only about my menstrual cycle. I advised her that I have had my cycle since I was 9, am no stranger to cramps, or cysts, or other strange uterine happenings...and this was not my uterus or any other part of my reproductive system. I asked that I be scanned for appendicitis. She *patted my hand* and said I would be seen in the order of priority since the ER was so busy and to hang in there. \n\nFour more hours passed. I mostly crawled from the stretcher to the nurses station this time. They miraculously found my MRI orders then. They said it'd be 45 minutes until the MRI, then another hour or so until it'd be read. I had to insist that I get the MRI more quickly and that it felt like my body was in real trouble. They had me in the machine 10 minutes later and then put me in a real ER room. The same PA came into my room a mere 10 minutes after that. \n\nHer exact words were, \"Well, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you sure do know your body and the bad news is we're keeping you. Your appendix needs to come out right now\".\n\nI replied that neither one of those things qualified to me as 'news' and that I was very disappointed that it took so much self-advocacy to receive a diagnosis. She apologized and I was put on the surgery list.\n\nI was bumped twice on the surgery list. Both times I was bumped for a man, I hope and assume their conditions truly warranted being moved ahead in line, but who knows. \n\nI finally had my surgery, but I spent 7 hours having to convince medical staff to even examine my appendix...all because I have female reproductive organs that they could blame instead. \n\nI wonder how much faster that rotten appendix would've been taken out if I had a penis and testicles instead.","title":"I wonder how much faster appendicitis diagnosed in people who don't have a uterus.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/l3hler\/i_wonder_how_much_faster_appendicitis_diagnosed\/","upvote_ratio":0.82,"over_18":false}

His elderly grandmother was prescribed it for her cancer. \n\nHowever, it can cause abortions alone with some success up to about 9 weeks and is sometimes used in conjunction with misoprostol for greater success.\n\nSo, of course, now pharmacists from all different pharmacies (not just Walgreens) are refusing to fill these prescriptions and some states have actually written methotrexate into their anti-abortion laws.\n\nTwo takeaways: 1) women are now having trouble accessing their arthritis medicine because of this and 2) if you need an abortion and have access to methotrexate or of you have access to methotrexate and know someone who needs an abortion, now you know that possibility exists.\n\nThis is the Arthritis Foundation's statement on this issue:\nhttps:\/\/www.arthritis.org\/about-us\/news-and-updates\/statement-on-methotrexate-access\n\nHere's a Time article\nhttps:\/\/time.com\/6194179\/abortion-restrictions-methotrexate-cancer-arthritis\/\n\nThis is info about methotrexate and abortions from a women's clinic:\nhttps:\/\/www.womenscenter.com\/methotrexate.html","title":"Walgreens allowing cashiers to deny us prescribed medication while refusing to help the teenager that got murdered in their breakroom is not unrelated.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/w39g1i\/walgreens_allowing_cashiers_to_deny_us_prescribed\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

The University promoted Jaeger to full professor WHILE HE WAS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. Here is a [Twitter thread](https:\/\/twitter.com\/OutsideOfDog\/status\/906563977282383873) pointing out some of the highlights (lowlights?). There was also [a Mother Jones piece about the scandal](http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/politics\/2017\/09\/she-was-a-rising-star-at-a-major-university-then-a-lecherous-professor-made-her-life-hell\/), but it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how everything has been mishandled.\n\nUniversity of Rochester president issued [a response likening the complaint to the discredited Rolling Stone UVa piece](http:\/\/www.rochester.edu\/president\/memos\/2017\/eeoc-filing.html), so basically accusing the complainants of lying. Even though the complainants filed publicly and include detailed references to witness testimony from nearly a dozen victims. And even though the university's own investigation found that Jaeger had sexual relations with current and prospective graduate students that he had power over.\n\nI hope this story gets much more widespread attention. It's a case of an institution choosing to believe the word of one powerful man over the complaints of many less powerful women. \n\n\nEdit: Glad to see that this got so many views and so much support! As noted in some of the comments, there's a [change.org petition](https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/university-of-rochester-remove-florian-jaeger-and-reevaluate-sexual-harrassment-policy) if you like signing things. The University of Rochester's president Joel Seligman can be reached at seligman@rochester.edu and (585)275-8356.\n\nI also want to point out that a big focus in the complaint is that the University did conduct an investigation, but it was too cursory and seemed more concerned about protecting the University than its students. Thus President Seligman's protests that \"we went through the process\" ignores the complaints that the process is inadequate.\n\nAs an example, a student who worked in Jaeger's lab as an undergraduate entered into a sexual relationship with him shortly after she graduated, but while she was still employed by the department and relying on him for letters of recommendation for grad school applications. The University declined to interview her because the relationship happened after she graduated, so it was technically okay - never mind that he wielded great power over her career or could have been grooming her while she worked in his lab as an undergraduate.","title":"7 University of Rochester profs submit 111-page complaint detailing serial sexual harassment and retaliation for whistleblowing; university president responds by calling them liars","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/6zg25x\/7_university_of_rochester_profs_submit_111page\/","upvote_ratio":0.82,"over_18":false}

As the title states my birth control failed and I found out last week I was pregnant. My husband (30M) and I (26F) discussed our options in depth but we can barely financially support ourselves currently and I cannot do my job while pregnant due to the company\u2019s insurance and associated risks. I am a contractor and would lose my job immediately if my employer found out. We want to be parents someday but it\u2019s not the right time and we have no support from family\/ friends. We also both grew up in poverty and swore we would never do that to our future children. \n\nAfter a lot of long discussions we decided that, since it\u2019s so early in the pregnancy, abortion is the best way forward. I did my best to be informed and do my research as to where to go and who to talk to but felt like I was going in circles so I figured my best bet was to talk to my GP and go from there (the closest Planned Parenthood type clinic is two+ hours away). I thought she might be able to provide more information or, at the very least, confirm that I am pregnant.\n\nThis is where my asshat of a doctor comes in. I\u2019ve been seeing her for about two years and she is the typical 2 minutes at most with you doctor. She really doesn\u2019t seem to have any f***s to give when it comes to her patients and makes you feel like you are wasting everyone\u2019s time if you ask her questions.\n\nKnowing this, I made sure to call and be very specific about my needs telling them I was pregnant and needing an abortion. The staff assured me multiple times that I needed to come into the office to speak to my doctor about it and would not provide anymore details in terms of cost or what to expect etc.\n\nI show up for the appointment with my husband and am asked when I check in what the appointment is for. I tell them that I am pregnant and need to discuss my options, receptionist enters it in and tells me to have a seat. When we finally get taken into a room, the nurse asks me again what I am here for and again I say I\u2019m pregnant and need to discuss abortion options. She writes it down without saying anything, takes my blood pressure and leaves.\n\nEnter Dr. Asshat, stage left.\n\nDr. A - \u201cHello. Why are you here today?\u201d\n\nMe -\u201c I\u2019m pregnant and need to discuss my options for...\u201d\n\nDr. A - (interrupting) \u201cHow do you know? At home pregnancy tests?\u201d\n\nMe - \u201cYes, I\u2019ve taken a couple and they all came out....\u201d\n\nDr. A - (interrupting) \u201cSo you need a referral for pre-natal care.\u201d\n\nMe - \u201cUm no, we\u2019re not ready to have a child yet and I wanted to discuss our options with you\u201d\n\nDr. A - (long pause while she looks at me, disgusted) \u201cYou mean you want an abortion? Really? An abortion? Ugh. (Makes aggressive eye contact with me) That\u2019s sad. (Looks at my husband, expectantly. Long pause while she stares daggers at us. Then rustles paperwork and get up as if to leave) We don\u2019t do that here. No one in the area does.\u201d\n\nMe -\u201cOk, but when I called I specifically told them this is what I needed and they told me....\u201d\n\nDr. A - (interrupting whilst huffing out a sigh like I\u2019m the slowest idiot she\u2019s ever dealt with) \u201cI can refer you to someone for pre-natal care but that\u2019s it. Nothing else. We don\u2019t do anything like that. There isn\u2019t anywhere near here that even does...those. You\u2019ll have to figure that out on your own.\u201d\n\nMe -\u201cOk, but when I called I specifically told them I needed an abortion and they told me I had to schedule an appointment to talk to you.\u201d\n\nDr. A - (continuing to gather up her paperwork) \u201cWe\u2019ll just cancel this appointment then, is that all?\u201d\n\nMe - \u201cUm yes, that was all\u201d\n\nDr. A - (walking out without a backward glance) \u201cgo down the hall to the right.\u201d\nEnd scene.\n\nI ended up getting a refund for my co-pay and bawling my eyes out in the parking lot while my husband hugged me. I have been so stressed about this (on top of being exhausted, dealing with morning sickness, and crazy emotional swings) and she made me feel like a despicable human being and utterly worthless. \n\nI understand that she is allowed to have her own opinions on the matter and has every right to disagree with our choice. However, as a medical professional that I entrust my care to, she does NOT have the right to make shitty comments about that choice and she does not have the right to treat me\/us the way she did. (The clinic she works for is not religiously affiliated and does not have any posted information anywhere about being anti-choice.)\n\nMy husband and I are both upset and angry but have not, and will not, change our minds on this. I\u2019ll also be finding a new GP as soon as humanly possible.\n\nEdit -Holy shit y\u2019all are amazing. I went for a walk to try and clear my head (can\u2019t stay upset for long watching an exuberantly happy pup on a walk) and came back to such an outpouring of love and support and I\u2019m so overwhelmed. THANK YOU to everyone who wrote encouraging words and to those that gave much needed advice. I have an appointment with the aforementioned Planned Parenthood and have transportation so hopefully this whole situation will be resolved in no time. I am working my way through the comments and doing my best to reply where I can. Thank you all. You will never know just how much of an impact you\u2019ve had. I no longer feel like my husband an I are alone in this \ud83d\udc9c\n\nEdit 2 - THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE AWARDS!! Thanks for even more encouraging comments and for the silver and gold guys. Y\u2019all really do know how to turn a gal\u2019s day around. My husband and I can\u2019t thank you enough for the support! Thank you for the loving comments and messages. Thank you to all those that messaged with offers of rides or funds. Thank you!!\n\nAlso just a few bits of info for y\u2019all that are asking;\n- I do live in the US (crazy this shit is still happening here, right?) in Florida specifically.\n- I have called and set up an appointment with the most \u2018local\u2019 PP office and do have transportation there. \n\nLastly: to those lovely individuals sending me expletive and hate filled messages; save your breath. I\u2019m not reading them and clearly you have your own personal issues to work out with all that copious free time currently spent on badly written hate mail. Please seek help for your violent tendencies so that you can handle having adult conversations with people without throwing a tantrum and using the word \u2018cunt\u2019.\n\nEdit 3 - Last edit y\u2019all! Thank you so much for all of the messages, chats, and comments. I\u2019ve done my best to respond to everyone, if I missed you I\u2019m sorry. My husband and I are incredibly thankful for this community and the support you\u2019ve shown us today. I will continue to respond as I can. From the bottom of my heart, thank you!! Thank you to all those that shared their stories in support and offered a shoulder to lean on should we need it. You\u2019ve made us feel so loved and I could never thank you enough.","title":"My Doctor called me \u2018sad\u2019 for wanting an abortion after my birth control failed.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/eluwox\/my_doctor_called_me_sad_for_wanting_an_abortion\/","upvote_ratio":0.81,"over_18":false}

I went through a bad breakup a few months back and I\u2019ve been on dating apps.\n\nSo I was chatting with this guy who seemed really nice and interesting and was fun to talk to, so we planned to go stargazing tonight. I laid down some \u201cI\u2019m not about sex on the first date\u201d ground rules and he was really cool about it. \n\nThen he said he had been catfished several times and wanted to make sure I was who I am on my profile. I added him on Snapchat and thought that was fine and all. So I sent him just a little regular selfie after my run this a.m. and he was like \u201cno I wanna see your whole body. Send me a pic of all of you.\u201d And I asked why, and he went on a diatribe about how he\u2019d been on several dates where girls were fatter than they were in their profile pictures, which he called deceptive and catfishing. \n\nFor context, I have had body issues for as long as I can remember, but have been working on myself for the last 6 months or so and am happier with my body than I have been in a while(down 37 pounds!). I think this is the first time I\u2019ve been happy with my appearance.\n\nSo I sent him a mirror pic of myself (cause I knew if I didn\u2019t he would think I was just another \u201ccatfisher\u201d) and waited for him to respond. He did the whole heart eyes thing and a lot of compliments and said he\u2019d had a lot of \u201ccrazy bitches\u201d deceive him in the past. Then I told him, \u201cI think making someone prove they are skinny\/pretty enough to be around you is a shitty and toxic way to treat a person. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been catfished, but I think having to prove my worth via physical appearance alone is a pretty big red flag. Thanks anyway!\u201d And canceled the date tonight. He wasn\u2019t very happy about it, but I am. \n\nI know it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but I\u2019ve had several relationships where someone has made me feel shitty about how I look, and I think I\u2019m finally learning to value myself as a person. I didn\u2019t know who else to tell, but it made me happy when I thought about it. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: Apparently I should have mentioned this, but I have three full body pics (all from the last two months) in my profile. And when he asked if they were recent I told him which ones were from the last few months and the one that is older.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve never gotten an award before!! Anonymous you are lovely and I appreciate you. The nice comments\/tips here have really made me feel better.

I grew up in paralyzing fear.\n\nThis man told me day in and day out that I was an Ugly Worthless Bitch. The first time I heard it, I was 8 years old. He\u2019d later tell me I deserved this since I was a girl. \n\nThis man told me he would shoot the family dog and it would be my fault. (He would later kill strays I brought home to save. 3 animals died this way before I had to stop and realize a stray had a better chance at life without my help). The same dog I was never allowed to feed or care for unless he allowed it. \n\nThis man threatened to bury me and my mother in the backyard of our property because \u201cwho would care or find us?\u201d\n\nThis man threw away and\/or falsified reports of women who filed for restraining orders. \n\nThis man was openly racist and cruel towards people no matter what. Every racist joke or derogatory quip toward LQBTQ+ would be justified and defended if questioned. \n\nAnd an entire fucking police station never once helped. The people who swore to protect and serve, where did they go when my mother and I were hunted down at the domestic violence shelter?\n\nWhere were the officers when my father broke my phone when I was 12 and LEFT me with relatives I hardly knew to go on a cross country road trip to stalk and force his ex girlfriend back into a relationship? (I was left in a house for a weekend to sleep on a floor and eat rotten food) \n\nAn entire police force in the town I grew up in never did a god damn thing.\n\nSo before you follow the \u201cblue lives matter\u201d remember that our lives didn\u2019t matter when we were scared and defenseless.\n\nRemember that when you say Blue Lives Matter, you\u2019re saying no one else has a right to live. \n\nNo, not every cop is bad....But the ones who stay silent are the ones that let this happen.\n\nThe officers who remain silent in the face of injustice are just as bad as tyrants like my biological father.\n\nAnd to those who have never had a bad experience, please count yourself lucky. Don\u2019t take that for granted.\n\n\nAlso let me really push this message: \n\nI support the men and women who became officers to fight for the people and serve their community.\n\nI support the protests.\nI support the riots.\n\nI do not support the men and women who use this platform to spread hate and fear.\n\nI do NOT support police officers who use their position to ignite the flames of injustice\nand abuse the trust of the people.\n\nI do not support my birthplace officers that let countless acts of terror and villainy rage for decades. The system is corrupt. The law was worse through the judges and attorneys my biological father bribed or threatened.\n\nOn a side note: I never personally nor will I ever understand the fear of being racially targeted and abused.\n\nI want to use this platform to show that I will no longer be silent if it might help someone in some way.\n\nEdit:\n\nHey I\u2019ve realized that when I wrote \u201cI support the riots\u201d , I should\u2019ve been clearer on my meaning and what I was truly trying to say.\n\nI\u2019m not going to take it out because I won\u2019t erase that mistake and instead embrace and learn from it.\n\nI want to thank every single one who has commented about it because you\u2019ve helped me learn how to voice what I feel in a better way and I promise I\u2019ll be trying and doing better in the future. \n\nI appreciate you all for sharing your stories with me. The times are changing and we need to have hope that we can help change it for the better.\n\nMy last edit: \n\nThe comments, the support, the stories, everything is overwhelming and I can say without a shadow of a doubt I appreciate every single word.\n\nI even understand the hate i have gotten. This is a sensitive topic for many people. I knew my words would have reactions and I want to let people know that the hateful comments aren\u2019t necessarily okay, but I understand why you wish to say them.\n\nYou want to be heard.\nYou want to get your message across.\n\nBut your message loses meaning when I\u2019m called a cunt. Or that you wish my home would burn. Or you say that lives don\u2019t matter.\nI get you\u2019re angry and want a reaction but please be mindful of your words. Even if they may not hurt me, they could have impact on another that reads them.\n\nI accept the criticism and want to learn and be better. I can only hope you do the same. \n\nWe can get through these times together. We can all do our part. I want every person who is on the front lines today to be safe. We are rooting for change for the better.","title":"From the view of a Police Chief\u2019s Daughter.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/guv88k\/from_the_view_of_a_police_chiefs_daughter\/","upvote_ratio":0.81,"over_18":false}

My OB works at the hospital and came to see me, (she delivered my daughter 19 months ago). She said \" We both know your body is perfectly capable of producing beautiful, healthy babies\", so she thought we should wait. She also told me that if I got the injection and it didn't work, the baby would certainly have defects and I would have to have a surgical abortion under medical law. I was shocked.\n\n1. This is not a baby, it's a cluster of cells that cannot possibly grow into a baby located in a place in the body that IS NOT FOR GROWING BABIES.\n2. Ectopic pregnancy can lead to the fallopian tube rupturing which can be fatal. It is extremely dangerous.\n3. I felt like I was being stabbed to death, even morphine was not touching the pain. My blood pressure was sky high and I was doubled over.\n4. Am I a walking miracle? Am I going to be the first woman in history to have an ectopic pregnancy that leads to a healthy child? That's what we are putting our money on?\n\nI wanted to share this experience because it left me flabbergasted and more than a little angry. This was a case when abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the mother, IF you can even call it an abortion at all. Suddenly there was a hard choice to be made and guilt and shame that needed to be felt? Fuck. That. Noise.\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for being so supportive and kind! I want to clear up a few questions. I was in the ER twice, the first time they told me I was pregnant, and I was presenting as ectopic (abdominal pain, severe vaginal bleeding), however they could not see the pregnancy in the fallopian tube or in the uterus. A doctor told me I should have an injection to terminate a possible ectopic pregnancy, I said that was what I wanted. A different doctor came to see me and told me since they could not see anything on the ultrasound I should go home and wait. They gave me pain meds and a strainer to check my urine in case I was possibly passing a kidney stone. I was told to come back if the pain worsened or I had any vomiting or fever.\n\nTwo days later I started vomiting uncontrollably and the pain was still there (even with the oxycodone) so I went back to the ER. A second ultrasound showed the pregnancy in the fallopian tube. Yet another doctor was horrified when I explained what happened on my first visit and laughed out loud when I mentioned the kidney stone theory, she said \"If it looks like an ectopic pregnancy and presents like an ectopic pregnancy, we should treat it like an ectopic pregnancy.\" She was concerned enough to call me at home the next day to see how I was doing and provided her personal cell if I had any questions or complications.\n\nMy takeaway from this is that when these things happen, you have to be your own biggest advocate. Listen to your body and trust yourself, don't be afraid to disagree with a doctor, and please don't let someone shame or convince you into not doing what is best for you.","title":"Ectopic pregnancy leads to abortion shaming...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/8xtc63\/ectopic_pregnancy_leads_to_abortion_shaming\/","upvote_ratio":0.83,"over_18":false}

About ten minutes after I woke up that morning I collapsed as sudden, sharp, pain started spreading from my lower left abdomen. It was *excruciating*. I have a very high pain tolerance, and I couldn't speak, or stand up, or walk. All I could do was writhe and cry and vomit in agony. I've had an ovarian torsion that required surgery before, as well as several instances of ruptured ovarian cysts that caused full-on internal bleeding. This felt like that.\n\nMy husband called 911 for an ambulance, as he did not believe he could get me safely to the car and drive with me in that condition.\n\nThe EMTs wouldn't even look at me and clearly didn't want to take me to the hospital. You see - we just moved, and the neighborhood is poor. I have 'locked hair, piercings, and tattoos and I wasn't obviously gushing blood from something like a gunshot wound. They quite clearly assumed I was faking and drug-seeking.\n\nAnd the rest of the day got no better.\n\nThese medical professionals let me writhe in agony for well over an hour while they grilled me about whether I was pregnant or not, over and over. Ironically - I'd actually really love to have another baby, but I had to be surgical sterilized (cauterized tubes) for my own safety over a decade ago. AND I haven't had sex in six months, which my husband confirmed for them at my bedside. None of those facts, or that trauma mattered to them. They angrily demanded that I *stand up* and go do their piss-test. I had to remind them, nearly screaming, that I couldn't stand up or walk and they begrudgingly and resentfully got me a bedpan.\n\nAll my blood and urine work came back clean because *of course it did*. I am not pregnant, and I wasn't on any illicit substances.\n\nThey did finally, at this point, provide a small amount of pain relief.\n\nThey did an ultrasound. They CT'd my abdomen.\n\nAnd much later an exasperated male doctor comes back to tell me I have a UTI. I know my body - this was *not* solely a UTI. I said as much, and restated my history.\n\nFriends, I shit you not, this is what he said to me (pissily):\n\n\"Well, *yes*, we found ruptured hemorrhagic cysts on your ovaries. And *I guess maybe* that could've caused your pain. I don't know. But there's no way to be sure. There's nothing we can do for you - we're discharging you.\"\n\nAs you might imagine - I have concerns at this point. I've been through this before, and both the internal bleeding and the recovery pain are things I wanted clearly addressed by the staff before I left.\n\nDespite my pain and the medication, I was calm and very polite as I tried to ask my questions. The doctor just walked away. And when I tried to ask my nurse she literally wouldn't stop interrupting me to talk over me. When my husband asked her why she wouldn't let me speak, she literally threw up her hands and said she wasn't going to talk to us anymore and walked out. I was discharged, and I needed to *fucking leave*.\n\nWhen my husband asked for a Patient Advocate, no one would acknowledge the request or even look at him. We didn't get a patient advocate, despite asking multiple times.\n\nThere was nothing to do but leave. Despite my medical history, proof of currently rupturing cysts on my ovaries, and clean drug tests - they still treated me like an addict using them to get high. And the second I wasn't pregnant, they didn't give a single flying fuck. I was a living incubator, or a drug addict, or both. And they didn't let me be anything else - I couldn't just be a person in crisis who needed help.\n\nThey didn't even note the ruptured cysts they found on my discharge paperwork - just the UTI.\n\nI don't want to hear excuses about the pandemic or worker burnout. It simply *isn't* an excuse. If you can't do your job without punching down on sick people *it's on you to find a new job*. Period.\n\nThe woman who personally performed my ultrasound, and the gentleman who directly performed my CT were both kind, empathetic people who obviously did their best. Being decent is clearly still possible.\n\nNo one else chose to be decent yesterday at DALLAS REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.\n\nI would tell you all to please be safe, but I don't really know how that's possible all things considered. Be aware, if nothing else, of how little you matter to these people.\n\nEdited to add: We have insurance, so that certainly wasn't the issue here.\n\nEdit #2: I can't see *any* comments left in the last 45 minutes or so you guys. I get phone notifications, and nothing is there, though the comment count continues to go up. From what little research I've done, it looks like A TON of comments may be being moderated, or auto-moderated.

It has some connections to my Uni and nearby Unis, which are also skewed towards women, and the nature of the games involved are more popular with women so naturally our group skews women.\n\nThe Facebook group has its own discord server which we use for voice chat in gaming sessions. I saw a post asking if anyone wants to join a scribble session (drawing game where people guess what you draw) with a link to the discord voice channel. Only 7 people showed up (there were some others but they left quickly). Me, 5 other girls and 1 guy.\n\nI actually didn't know anyone at all since I'm not that active, but I had a very fun time chatting with these people. What I noticed halfway through is that the way we treated each other was the exact same way we treated the sole guy in the group. No one harassed him, asked him for nudes, hit on him, aggressively asked him for his instagram\/snapchat, or otherwise made him feel uncomfortable. Likewise he didn't harass anyone either. We just played the game normally and had lots of laughs, drawing funny sketches and making terrible guesses at what other people drew. BTW this is not one of the regular games in the group; it was just a quick and easy to set up game for people who are bored in that moment.\n\nThis is the only session I've been in, even though I've been in the server\/group for a few months now. I've searched through chat logs and Facebook posts and I've found pretty much zero posts complaining about being harassed (male or female) or otherwise made to feel uncomfortable. And we have thousands of people in the group. No one knows each other IRL, and we have people from all around the world, although most are from the US, and people from all sorts of ages.\n\nNow compare this to experiences of female gamers in male-dominated gaming spaces, who are often harassed and bullied and ultimately made to feel very uncomfortable and even unsafe. I just wish that some male gamers, just like female gamers, could treat other people like normal beings and not suddenly change their mood just because someone with an opposite-sex-sounding voice joins the server.

In a study of pregnant teens, only 2 out of 36 girls showed clear signs of penetration. \n\n* Hymens can be damaged as a result of other non-sex activities, including exercise.\n\n* Hymens don't bleed much when damaged, as they have few blood vessels in them.\n\n* The majority of women do not experience pain or bleeding the first time they have sex, and if they do it may not be related to the hymen at all. Bleeding is a common result of sex that is too rough or not lubricated enough, which is extremely common in couples who are inexperienced. Variations in an individual woman's anatomy can also lead to bleeding even with otherwise well-lubricated and gentle sex.\n\nThat's my public service announcement.

I\u2019ve never dealt with something quite like this before! It\u2019s so outrageous that women have to go through harassment and then, on top of that, are made to feel as if they\u2019re at fault! \n\nMy cousin (29F), who I\u2019ve been close with for my entire life, has a husband (30ishM) whose manners I (24F) would describe as .... well... uncivilized to say the least. To get to the point, we were all in the kitchen (my cousin, her husband, and I. My boyfriend wasn\u2019t with us at the time) at our grandmothers house. I was washing the dishes, and my cousin was sitting across the room. Her husband is standing next to me. All of a sudden, this fucking guy slaps my ass. I\u2019m talking full ass smack, with the palm of his hand. \n \nI simply froze. I was absolutely horrified, mortified, humiliated, embarrassed, and so, so, SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I wanted to cry. I managed to sputter out something to the effect of \u201cWHY DID YOU JUST DO THAT? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!\u201d To which their response was.... complete surprise and bewilderment. They were genuinely taken aback at the fact that I reacted the way I did. They both immediately went into defensive mode, saying that it was just a joke\u2014 didn\u2019t I see that my cousin was right there, and it can\u2019t have been in a sexual way? It was just a joke! It was supposed to be funny! All their friends do stuff like this all the time and they think it\u2019s funny!\n\nObviously, I disagree. I was so shocked, I don\u2019t even remember exactly what I said, but I made it clear that I was angry, uncomfortable, and this was highly inappropriate. They said they were sorry, but they also really made me feel kind of stupid for being so uncomfortable, like as if I\u2019m some kind of prude who just has no sense of humour. \nAm I crazy? In my eyes, it\u2019s so beyond unacceptable to smack a woman\u2019s ass like that (unless you have the kind of relationship that permits that, obviously!). I don\u2019t understand how they could BOTH have seen this as a funny joke. How could I not be mad about this? I felt really violated \u2014 this is MY body and you have 0 right to it, and I don\u2019t care if you thought it would be a \u201cjoke\u201d! \n\nI told my boyfriend about it today because... well, I wanted to! And of course he reacted by being really angry at this guy for having the nerve to do that. My boyfriend feels, as I do, that this was a gesture of blatant disrespect and I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with my cousins husband anymore, nor does my boyfriend. \nWell, my boyfriend messaged the husband because he was (and is) really angry about this. My cousin sent me back the screenshot of my boyfriends text saying this to me :\u201cyou\u2019ve done a great job \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f for what was meant as an innocent joke. We understood you got mad and both apologized. Had no idea things would end up like this. And there was no single ounce of disrespect. But gee, this is great. Guess I needed a good cry for today.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re kind of making me feel like I\u2019m blowing things out of proportion and ruining my relationship with my cousin and her husband for nothing. \nAm I crazy?

So, here I am to rant and rave and hopefully impart the wisdom of speaking up for oneself to a teenager that may need it.\n\nI got my first bloody welcoming into puberty at ten (while riding a horse, to make matters worse!) and for those first few years, things were relatively painless. Of course it was too good to last and, come my first foray into middle school, disaster struck.\n\nWhat had once been a mildly uncomfortable inconvenience became something that left me crying and bedridden for weeks at a time. Turns out six years later: nothing was considered terribly wrong with my body. In fact, all my baby making bits are in working order as of this post. But my body failed terribly at the whole menstrual business.\n\nSo I would bleed for months at a time (usually heavily with extreme clotting) with such intense pain that I could barely get out of bed, let alone go to school or have a social life beyond my phone and computer. It would leave my sobbing and light headed and ungodly sick. Then, for a few glorious months, I wouldn't bleed one bit. The cycle of this repeated regularly as my mother took my to the gyno and I was tested and questioned until they just prescribed birth control.\n\nIt changed my life in ways I cannot describe.\n\nThat tiny little pill offered me my freedom and childhood back. I could go to school, I could hang out with my friends. I was not longer burning through super pads and tampons within two hours. Everything became a million times better.\n\nAt fourteen and fifteen I began picking up my monthly pack on my own when my mother was too busy. I had never had an issue. None of the clerk's had ever batted an eye as they got my bag together and checked me out. Just my name, birthday, and a signature to get my blessed ticket to comfortable living.\n\nUntil one month, when I was sixteen, and I ran into the Walmart Pharmacy to get my packet while my mother waited in the car. It shouldn't have been more than seven minutes with a line, maybe five without one. We'd done this countless times by then.\n\nSo I went in, waited for the two people before me to finish up, and got to the counter. Before me stands a short, older woman. I told her I'm there for my birth control and gave her my name. She asked for my birthday, eyes scanning over me. I remember trying to ignore the judging stare.\n\n\"How old are you?\" She asked after a long pause following my giving her my birth year, not once, but twice.\n\n\"I'm sixteen.\"\n\n\"That's too young. I'm not going to give this to you. You'll have to have a parent come in.\"\n\nI was shell shocked and confused. I didn't know the laws like I do now, or else I'd have made a scene, and I wish so badly I had asked to speak to somebody else that could've save me this hassle.\n\n\"I pick up from here every month,\" I said and prayed I didn't sound like some meek kid, wishing desperately that she would give me my medicine as a line was forming by that point and my social anxiety was skyrocketing. \"Nobody ever said I needed a parent. It's prescribed for me, not my mother.\"\n\n\"Well you'll have to have her come in regardless. Sorry.\"\n\nI left the pharmacy and fast walked out of the front doors trying to will away tears or embarrassment and a million other emotions I still cannot name to this day. Thankfully, as mentioned, my mother was in the car.\n\nI told her what had happened and she told me to stay in the car while she ran in. She told me that she gave the woman an earful. I ended up with my pills that month.\n\nBut the thing is, there wasn't anything policy or legality wise to prevent me from getting my medicine. It was the woman's own beliefs.\n\nShe didn't see a teenager that had missed out on several years of her childhood. She didn't see the immense pain I would be in without the medication. She didn't know I would bleed for the next several months, or that I'd be so lightheaded I would feel dizzy and almost blackout just getting out of bed, or that I'd be crying out and sobbing from the pain that nothing could help, or that I'd fall behind in school so badly (I actually failed a school year because of this issue) it would take weeks to make up. She didn't have a single idea what the pill provided for me.\n\nShe only saw a teenager that *must* be using the pill for pregnancy prevention. \n\nAnd the thing is: both of those girls would have deserved their right to the pill just the same.\n\nThank you for listening to my rant. Please, all pill taking people: know the laws and policies of your area so you won't doubt yourself like I did and possibly be in a worse situation. I've learned them since (found them out after this incident) and keep updated as best I can.\n\n*(Edit: I never expected this to blow up with so much attention and support. Thank you to everyone that shared their stories and thoughts and helpful or encouraging words. I never expected gold either, so another major thanks for that, of course!

About 80 years ago, after my grandmother had given birth to her 9th child, the doctor told her if she got pregnant again, the childbirth would kill her. She went to her parish (Catholic) priest and asked for permission to use the rhythm method (the most benign and ineffective form of contraception), but the priest denied her permission, saying that she had to be \\*faithful\\* to her husband (meaning submission to my grandfather's sexual desires, i guess). Of course she wound up getting pregnant. \n\nOne day a friend came over and asked her why she was cleaning her windows when she was 7 months pregnant. She responded that she was cleaning them for her wake. And after she died a few months later during childbirth, she was displayed in her casket in her house, which had nice clean windows. This detail kills me and keeps me up at night; i dont know much about my grandmother's life except that it ended with her facing an unnecessary death forced on her by her priest, and she was worried about the fucking windows being dirty.\n\nThis story was told to me pretty matter of factly, with a little bitterness. But it seems like most of my extended family is still pretty devout catholics, and no one ever told me exactly why she died from childbirth. Of course, this all happened a long time ago, and details could have been changed or exaggerated, but a woman in my family cooking or cleaning for her own funeral is pretty typical w\/ my family.","title":"Why abortion rights matter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/tk85r3\/why_abortion_rights_matter\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

I was at open mic night earlier. One of the musicians managed to secure a ride from me. We hit the road, he immediately changes his tone and won't tell me where he's going and just insists we are going to my house, that I'm so fucking irresistible  that he simply cannot be expected to control himself and respect my boundaries, even when I am dressed like a 15 year old boy who skateboards to get places; EVEN when I had already said upfront I wasn't there to get dick and was totally clear about it. Next thing I knew, I realized I was alone in my car with some fucking drunk guy who was NOT concerned one bit with my feelings about his advances. I realized he was sporting a huge survival knife on his belt, and that he thought \"No\" means \"just keep at it.\" I wound up pulling into a random apt complex like a mile north of my place, telling him to sit tight while I go park the car on the front side of the bldg, and ditching him with zero explanation or apology. I was afraid of him getting angry if I stood my ground and just wanted him the fuck away from me. Idk what runs through the head of a guy like him when they're being all horny and hearing not a fucking word I'm saying. But I guarantee you he is shocked as a fucking Pikachu and deciding that I'm a sheisty bitch for what I did. Thankfully my comfort is more important than his feelings and I\nKnow that. Idk what he expected to come of trying to tell me what's what in my own goddamn house. Jesus Fucking Christ man. Not on my turf,  nor on his life. Hard pass.\n\nEDIT!-- I did text the guy who owns the place we were all at last night, and he just texted me back so he def knows now and I don't really care what anyone thinks of me besides him. So if the guy shows back up to talk down on me he is all ready for it and knows what happened at least :) I love my community quite so!\n\nSecond Update!--I returned to the venue the next night for our usual karaoke night. Partially cause I was working late last night and also to hopefully avoid encountering the creep, I waited until like midnight to go. The owner was behind the bar and had a story to tell me from earlier.  So the guy DID come back in a few hours before I did, with the owner being fully aware of the incident from night before. Owner served him, and creep actually told the exact same story I told you guys; and was truthful and didn't really trash talk me for my actions. Owner told him that what he'd done wasn't cool and guy agreed, so I HOPE he learned SOMETHING.  Owner let him stay on premises until the guy managed to REALLY piss off our KJ by informing him that his dog MIGHT chew the wires for the sound board unless KJ supervised this damn dog that wasn't even his. KJ said \"yeah fuck you bro\" and the guy started some shit with KJ and hassled other customers and the owner apparently went ahead and tossed the dude out in accordance with his obviously crappy tendencies. Owner never tells someone to just GTFO and prefers to solve disagreements and keep everyone welcome.  Well last night he emphatically 86'd someone finally.  When I came in later he was very apologetic to me for my experience and I said \"no worries, I know none of us knew the dude it's all good, thanks for getting him outta here for everyone's sake.\" And life went on and we all had a good time. Long live my favorite place to drink and bullshit!\n\nI've said it once or twice before and I'll just say it again: I am pretty much exponentially in love with this man.

I was 17years old, shy and awkward. I was paired with a man in his early thirtyi-ish named Kevin. I was terrified, a sexual assault survivor, and an adult man touching me, lifting me in the air, and sliding me between his legs backwards (swing dancing is wild when you type it lol), and I was so scared. I was trying to find my adult legs, and face my fears I had an amazing boyfriend, but adult men scared the beans out of me.  This lovely, lanky, goofy man could not have been more appropriate, more kind, and more healing to me.\nA little over ten years later, I moved back to my hometown, and started working at the local coffee shop. I was pregnant with my first baby. The UPS guy came in on my first day of work, and here was Kevin! Still as kind, as disarmingly cheerful. We recognized each other and took a swing around the shop. Now I have three kids, and he is the UPS driver on my home route. Every time I see him I smile. I saw him yesterday as he dropped off packages and gave our dogs cookies and it got me thinking. \n\nI think it's so important to recognize how healing good interactions with kind men can be to young girls. This is why the narrative of \"don't put yourself in scary situations\" is so bad. We, as girls, should be able to expect this sort of interaction. Yet, I remember him because it was such a rare and treasured memory of an adult man NOT being a creep. How sad, that simply being a good human is so remarkable.","title":"The UPS Man","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/nvcjdz\/the_ups_man\/","upvote_ratio":0.94,"over_18":false}

It was 11:45 tonight, a Sunday, and the roads were pretty deserted. Me, being the procrastinator that I am, was on my last bit of gas and HAD to stop to make it home. I pulled into the nearest gas station and it was closed, but not a big deal as I had my debit card. I scanned the station and saw you pumping gas and immediately felt better as there was someone else with me at the empty and dimly lit station.\n\nI got out, glanced around, being aware of my surroundings as my always paranoid mother taught me. We made eye contact and you gave me a comforting smile. I was typing in my pin number and noticed you closing your gas cap and getting into your vehicle. I didn't want you to leave. You were a stranger, you could have been a serial killer, but your smile and your eyes put me at ease. I felt safer with you around. \n\nYou pulled away and went around the gas station and the minute you were out of sight, I was on alert. I kept checking my surroundings, wishing I hadn't picked the seeimingly slowest pump at this station. \n\nHe came put of no where-- I was alone and then I wasn't. He wore camo pants and an oversized black hoodie, the hood up and shielding a lot of his face. I gripped my keys tightly in my hand, trying to get them between my fingers just in case. He asked for a ride, calling me \"sugar titties\" and winking. I quickly said, \"sorry, I have somewhere to be\" and wished I had sounded more confident as the words left my mouth. He persisted, yanking on the door handle of my passenger back door. I said \"no!\" again, this time, more forcefully. He kept laughing, like this was the most hilarious game in the world and tried my passenger door.\n\nI froze. I'm not proud of myself. I should have jumped into the car and drove off. I should have had my cell phone in my hand instead of my car. I should have gotten gas that morning instead of the last minute. In everyday life, I'm typically a force to be reckoned with and strong and painfully independent. Why did I freeze? Why didn't I jump into action? Why did I act like a sitting duck instead of a ferocious lion? \n\nAnd then you came. You rolled up next to us in that boxy Element car that I used to complain about to anyone who would listen and you just rolled down your window, your phone in one hand, illuminating your face in the darkness. \n\n\"I have 911 on the line. Take your chances or keep walking.\"\n\nHe immediately put his hands up, shaking his head. A slew of curse words were said, including crazy bitch and he backed away. My eyes left him and moved to you. You simply nodded and drove away, not actually pulling out onto the street until you saw that I was safely in my car.\n\nTo the lady at the gas station,\n\nThank you. Thank you for being kind, for being strong, and for caring about a complete stranger that needed help. I can only hope that if I'm ever in such a situation again, I have the same strength and confidence you have. The world could use more people like you.","title":"To the woman at the gas station","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/76oc7z\/to_the_woman_at_the_gas_station\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

And he brought up the Try Guys and all the drama today. And then started saying how he liked their content but they got too political. I asked, where do you lie in politics?

He started spouting off some conspiracy theories about how maybe the election was rigged and that we\u2019re finding out now some things were true.

I didn\u2019t jump to any conclusions, he led me down the rabbit hole. He also claims to be atheist so I\u2019m not sure how he got so sucked into Trumpism. \n\n2) Speaking of abortion rights, I do not agree with his stance. I believe in unrestricted access to abortion for many reasons. I highly encourage to watch this video by Mama Doctor Jones who gives a thorough review on why banning or restricting abortions is not only unethical but has lasting impact on the woman, her future, her children, and her community.[Doctor Explains Roe V Wade](https:\/\/youtu.be\/rHrxSUgLvvA)\n\n3) For those saying I was ruining relationships with politics or bringing politics where it doesn\u2019t need to be, screw you. It must be nice to live in a world where actual government policies don\u2019t affect you. I work in healthcare and government needs to stay out of my job. What happens with someone\u2019s body is their and only their decision.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m going to keep putting good vibes out into the world and I\u2019m still optimistic that I will find someone who gets me.","title":"I made my date leave after 20 minutes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/xpz5r0\/i_made_my_date_leave_after_20_minutes\/","upvote_ratio":0.8,"over_18":false}

Source 5 is the appeal)\n\nThe woman who was allegedly raped by a group of men in Ayia Napa, Cyprus warns visitors from visiting the place as she prepares to appeal her conviction in a new interview. Cyprus has long struggled with human trafficking and rape cases, and has one of Europe's lowest conviction rates for rape.\n\nFor those new to the case:The British woman (18 at the time) was having consensual sex with one man, while another one secretly filmed her without her consent. Then, his friends broke in, pinned the girl down and allegedly raped her. The men claim it was consensual. She claims that up to 12 of them raped her, however, you can't expect a gang rape victim to remember the exact number of her attackers. DNA evidence and footage linked 7 of them to the crime scene, not 12.\n\n\\- She withdrew her accusation after being interrogated for eight hours without access to a translator or lawyer. She claims the police intimidated her into withdrawing her accusation, but the officers deny this. Why can't we verify anyone's claim? Because the cops didn't record the interrogation nor did they take notes about what she was saying. She was then thrown in jail for a month and had her passport confiscated,\n\n\\- The men, who were referred to as \"good lads\" by their parents, were released, went home, chanted \"The Brit is a whore\" when landing in their home country, and then released revenge porn of the girl to the media. You know, prime \"good lad\" behavior. **Important note: None of the videos shows her having consensual sex with multiple men. The video 4chan has been circulating is fake.** It's taken from a random porn site and isn't even shot in the same hotel room. If you jumped to conclusion and assumed she is guilty over that fake video, you need to use this moment for some self-reflection. The real videos merely show her having consensual sex with one guy. In other words, the real videos are from before his friends broke in. The Cypriot media also **falsely** claimed that she had made rape accusations in the past and that she was a stripper.\n\n\\- She was charged with \"public mischief\", but wasn't allowed to present evidence of her rape. The judge argued that it wasn't a rape trial. Thing is, how is she supposed to prove that she didn't lie when she isn't allowed to present evidence of her rape? Some of the evidence the judge didn't allow was the 35 bruises and scratches on her body, especially around her groin and buttocks, and a bloodied condom with the men's DNA which the incompetent police had missed. The judge, Michalis Papanasthasiou, insisted that all the bruises were the work of a jellyfish, despite the doctors telling him that he was wrong. The government's medical examiner meanwhile barely found any scratches because he didn't check her entire body and \"forgot\" to add basic information like height and weight in his half-page report.\n\nNo matter who's story you believe, you can't deny that the way the Cypriot police and judicial system has handled this case has been a massive joke.

He said \"if my wife put out three girls in a row, I'd cheat til I got a boy\". \n\n(I explained that it was actually the man's material contribution to pregnancy that determines sex, but why did I bother? He was clearly dumb.) \n\nOh he said \"I don't believe in gender roles but there's just so many things I don't think women are physiologically capable of.\" in reference to me discussing painting houses with my dad. Painting houses y'all. \n\nHe then went off about how our city was being \"taken over by alphabet people\". In response I played dumb and asked him what alphabet people were. He said \"Think about the alphabet. Who describes themselves with letters?\". I said, \"Like Sesame Street? The Muppets?\". He rolled his eyes and said I needed to get out in the world more (I'd just told him I moved back here after living various places and travelling for ten years. I mentioned I'd lived in five cities, been to 30 states and 15 countries.) he also said I should \"touch grass\". \n\nHe opened a weed vape in front of me and went off to the bathroom to hit it. So I grabbed my coat and things and ran right out the door. Luckily we'd only communicated through the app we met on, so he has no way to contact me or my full name. \n\nHe is 35. What a waste of an hour. \n\nBut I will say I'm proud of myself. When I was younger I would just sit through the whole date in fear and play nice and pretend that I was having a great time so he wouldn't get mad at me. But I literally spent most of this one thinking \"how do I leave NOW?\" and took the first chance I got.\n\nEdit: \n\n1. Met on an app. Had many text convos before planning this lunch. He was polite, smart, and interesting. His profile said \"liberal\". \n\n2. This was all kind of word vomited out pretty quickly.

He pretty much had just said \"I hate women.\" I wasn't going to run the risk he would prove it via violence. You don't even need a license for a gun in my state. I was being cautious.\n\n4. Alphabet people is how some people do the wink and nudge to let you know they don't like LGBTQ+ people. The first time I heard it used was in a Dave Chappell bit. And the second time was today. I know he meant this because even though I played dumb, he then made his comment about this city turning into San Fransisco. I said \"The rent here isn't that high.\" even though I know what he meant because of how associated my city is with gay culture. This is when he rolled his eyes, said he needed weed, and went to the bathroom. I made my graceful exit immediately after he was out of my eyeline.\n\nEdit: \n\nAtlanta is pretty progressive generally, especially in this part of it. The app only lets you choose liberal, conservative, moderate, or other.\n\nEdit: \n\nI might be wrong about sperm being what determines sex in babies. Biology was my only B in college.

I'm exhausted.\n\nI'm a physician, and I get bullshit for being a female literally every day. I typically have a good sense for benign bias from well-meaning patients and colleagues versus malignant, angry sexism, and I navigate those scenarios accordingly. That alone takes some effort, but it's become second nature, so whatever. I'm used to being called \"nurse\" or \"ma'am\" or \"miss\" or \"lady\" by patients. I've described, in detail, a surgery I am JUST ABOUT TO PERFORM, and had the patient afterwards ask when they can speak to a doctor. I've had a patient call me \"sweetheart\" while I was sticking a needle into him. I've come to assess a very sick ICU patient and had an old female nurse declare \"the little lady is here!\". I've fought very public fights with sexist superiors and become better and stronger for it. I'm known as vocally opinionated and \"sassy\", and that's fine, I definitely am. I normally try to wear that proudly.\n\nThis pediatric month, I'm working with a colleague of my training level who is way less experienced in our current content but still CONSTANTLY interrupts me when I'm talking to staff and patients during MY procedures, and I've chalked it up to social unawareness. Today, I enter a room to do a procedure and introduce myself as \"Dr. MrsRodgers\" to the patient's dad. I go to shake the patient's father's hand, and he physically recoils, takes 2 steps back, and says, \"Oh, oh, I can't shake your hand, sorry, it's religous\". I was confused, but whatever, fine, roll with it. I start explaining the procedure I am about to perform on his child, and my colleague barrels in. He interrupts me immediately, stating, \"Hi, I'm Dr. Colleague, I work with \\*MY FIRST NAME\\*\", and walks up to shake the dad's hand. The dad immediately extends his hand and engages in a handshake.\n\nI was fucking crushed. I felt so dehumanized. Watching my patient's father shake my less experienced male colleague's hand, the male colleague who had just introduced himself as Dr. Colleague while stripping me of my title and casually referring to me as my first name, after that father had just recoiled from my handshake... In that moment, I realized it never ends. This fight never ends. It doesn't matter what I do, what degrees I earn, how hard I work, how smart or compassionate or accomplished I ever am or ever will be. I will always be second class. I will always be interrupted by male colleagues. I will always deal with sexist \"jokes\" from old male attendings. I will always be called nurse at best, sexually harassed at worst by patients. People will always look to my younger male trainees and assume they're in charge. It never ends. I am so fucking tired of fighting this fight and I am so, so sad that everything I've worked my entire life for is ignored daily by patients, colleagues, and bosses. I am angry that my conservative friends\/family immediately dismiss my LIVED sexist experiences any time I share. It SUCKS. I wish I had the confidence and gravitas of an under-qualified man. I really do.\n\nTomorrow, I pick up the mantle and fight again. But tonight, I'm just tired. Thanks for listening, ladies, love you all.\n\nEdit: Wow guys, this blew up. I'm reading everything, I promise. First and foremost to the brilliant, accomplished women sharing their stories and frustrations: you are smart and strong and loved. Thank you for making this world better. To the empathetic men: thank YOU for listening, and for being allies\/advocates. You are appreciated. To the people trying to explain the no-handshake religious stuff: I get it. I'm not arguing the validity\/merit\/rules of their religion, I'm just sharing how dehumanizing it was. To those worried about my workplace: I work for a great institution, this stuff happens everywhere. And to the people messaging me physical threats of violence and calling me a c**t: thanks for adding fuel to the fire.","title":"I'm so tired","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/ex0uhw\/im_so_tired\/","upvote_ratio":0.75,"over_18":false}

Even today women are still excluded from combat roles in a lot of countries, and they were only allowed to start applying in developed world countries within the last 10 years (2013 in the U.S., 2016 in Australia and the U.K., etc). So obviously men will be the majority of combat deaths, since they have consistently decided they're the only ones fit and able enough to be out there. Plus this ignores civilian casualties of war, a lot of which are women.\n\n**\"Men are the majority of prisoners\"**\n\n* Men commit over 90% of all homicides, 86% of violent crimes and almost all sexual violence crimes. What do they expect the numbers to be, 50\/50??\n\n**\"Men are the majority of suicides\"**\n\n* Women attempt suicide at 3 times the rate men do, and suffer from psychological disorders that lead to it twice as often. Men simply succeed in committing suicide more, despite attempting it far less often, because they typically choose more violent means such as putting a gun in their mouth or jumping off a building, whereas women choose less violent means such as taking pills and falling asleep, which give a much greater chance of something going wrong, changing your mind at the last second and calling for help or being found in time etc. \n\n**\"Men may be the majority of high paying jobs, but they are also the majority of construction workers and brick layers\"**\n\n* Only because the toxic masculinity permeated throughout the trades effectively keeps women away from them. And some of these jobs pay a lot more than women make in fields they traditionally dominate such as teaching and social work. Plus, it's laughable hypocrisy to constantly talk about women not having a greater share of high prestige\/high paying jobs because they CHOOSE not to do them, yet then ignore men CHOOSING to go into these types of fields. Last time I checked, nobody put a gun to their head and told them they had to work in construction.\n\nPeople have tried to shut down women's causes and gaslight us for years, but on this Women's Day I say we take a stand to reaffirm our resolve, remember what we're fighting against - all that societal injustice - and NEVER let the likes of the MRAs, the both-sides crowd, men scared of losing their privilege or other unscrupulous individuals gaslight and trick us from continuing the fight.

To do something as right now it is hard to figure out what.\n\nLast Monday and the weekend before that were so amazing. We went to see our dream apartment that we were planning to buy, we went for lunch with his parents, next day a brunch with his fraternity brothers and their spouses. A beautiful ring on my finger. Wedding in August. Everyone so exicted. He changed his job almost a year ago and on Monday his first big project successfully went into production. He was the hero of the day. I had some impro classes that day, so came home a bit late. He in general was trying to live healthy to look his best for the wedding, but felt like celebrating therefore went to Mc Donalds. A glass of champagne in the evening. A tost, how awesome he is. A cat in the lap that we took as kitten last Easter. As he tends to snore I usually go to sleep a bit earlier we sleep in different rooms. Tuesday morning. I wake up and go to him for our morning cuddle. He is cold. Blue. Blood through nose. I panic, call the ambulance. Then they call the police as he was just 33. I call his mom.\n\nNo real reason why. Forensics wrote that something with the heart, but nothing precise as there was no crime, no violence, no poisoning, nothing. A young man just went to sleep and did not wake up.\n\nPlanning the funeral that will happen tomorrow.

We all need each others support, but I know that I cannot replace their son.\n\nNothing and no one to really blame. Perhaps his ex-girlfriend that was originally the love of his life ho just one day without mentioning a reason just left. During their relationship I know that some drugs were involved, so that probably fucked up his heart a bit more. But since we met, he has been using only some generic antidepressants and sometimes just a bit too much Whiskey, but nothing that could kill a 33 year old.\n\nOne thing that helps is the thought about moving out of my current apartment as it would feel too much to keep on living here. I will be moving in with a good friend of mine, therefore I will not be alone. Also I have to take care of the cats - mine that is 10 years old and grumpy and his that is almost 1 year old that is just pure love and positive energy.","title":"One evening me (F31) and my fianc\u00e9 (M33) were planning our wedding.

I get out and this guy in his car parked in a spot one row behind me sticks his head out of his open window and yells *\"Excuse me, your in a handicap spot!\"* in a really rude tone.\n\nLook, I get it... I'm only in my 30's and appear younger.  I can walk and can do so in a way that appears normal.  I have no visible birth defects, deformity, or injuries.  There's no way he could've seen my handicap placard the way we were both parked.  So because of all these things listed, I politely said *\"Yes sir, I know.  My handicap placard is hanging on my rearview mirror\"*.  At this point I turn to continue walking into the store and HE GETS OUT OF HIS CAR AND STARTS SCREAMING AT ME!!!  Like, WTF???  In a crowded parking lot full of people!  He accused me of using someone else's placard and being a lazy, entitled princess cheating the system like a piece of shit and demanded I get back in my car and move to a regular spot because handicap spots aren't meant for spoiled bitches who think they're special.\n\nAt this point I just yelled back *\"Why don't you mind your own business!  You don't know anything about me you fucking asshole!\"*  I then spun around and walked into the store.  Thank God he didn't follow me.  Everyone in the parking lot had stopping dead watching this whole inappropriate scene and during this guys tirade several of them were shaking their heads and shooting dirty looks at me for using a handicapped spot.\n\nI'm still so upset about the whole event even tho it's hours later and here's what I'd like that jerk and all the people who agreed with him to know......\n\nWhen I was 18 yrs old I was in the passenger seat of a friend's car that was broadsided by a drunk driver traveling at approx 50mph.   The passenger door where I was sitting was the direct point of impact.  My hip was shattered in that accident along with cracking 2 of my vertebrae and causing a hairline fracture to my pelvis.  It took dozens of titanium screws, plates, pins, etc and hours of surgery to reconstruct my hip and stabilize my pelvis.  And then due to a previously unknown\/undiagnosed autoimmune issue my body began rejecting the metal used to piece my hip back together.  It took me **YEARS** of medical intervention, physical therapy, pain, tears, strength and willpower to recover.  \n\nIt's been 20 years since then.  My gait appears normal when I walk *for SHORT distances*.  To much activity however can leave me nearly crippled in pain for days.  I deserve the handicap placard I was given. I need it.  Just because I'm not elderly or in a wheelchair doesn't mean I don't have a disability.  Not all disabilities are visually apparent and nobody should be making judgments about people they know nothing about.\n\nI should be able to use my handicap placard without being harrassed and I don't deserve to have some guy scream insults at me on some misguided parking lot justice warrior crusade.

It is 'meant' to indicate actresses age 18 and 19, who are still technically teens. However, in our common perception, when someone says teen, we do not  think of the 18 or 19 year olds first. We think of the 12 - 16 year olds. We think of those who have braces and are getting picked up from school. We think of those who are in need of protection, especially from sexualization of adults.\n\nJust using the word teen for porn, even though technically correct, lays a connection to view teens as sexual for any adult watching. Even if subconsciously. This is how our brains work though. We link together what we see together, and then we cannot always differentiate.\n\nWhen I was still a teen, whether below or 18 and up, could not watch any porn tagged or titled with the word teen. Even when it was supposed to be my age. I just found it disgusting because for me the word teen immediately reminded me of actual underage teens and those were not people to be in porn or shown to have sex with adult men. To masturbate to that?  I could not. And I know other women and men who feel the same.\n\nSeeing how so much content is titled or tagged as teen, how many of the set ups include teddy bears, school uniforms and all these other references of children and young teenagers, it is sickening. I have long stopped watching porn, towards the end of it I checked out sites like Chaturbate, because I felt there was at least some sort of autonomy of content creators. Yet, so many set-ups included these references to young teenagers.\n\nContent with actresses and actors age 18 and 19 should be then be tagged differently. ~~Perhaps 18+ would be a better idea.~~  (edit) Young adult is an appropriate term (edit-end)\n\nHas anyone else thought or read about this? What do you guys think it should be named instead? Also I've just formed the idea in my mind a few days ago after another post related to this topic. I believe it can be explained even better than I did, and probably also more scientifically (the impact of language etc.) so I am curious what you all have to say.  \n\n\nEDIT: I wanted to take time this morning to read through the discussions, but wow. Thank you all for your sharing your input, views, reflections and experiences! And the awards (oh my, Gold, it will be spend wisely in this community!) Thank you! And yes I do have plans to continue this agenda and anyone who wants to join me, send a DM.   \n\n\nSo a few points to wrap this post up for now.   \n\n\n* I agree, 18+ is just as bad as barely legal and not much better than teen. **Young adul**t would be the most appropriate turn.\n* Incest, Step, Incel and others words (I am sorry If I missed some) should not have a placce there too. \n* The relationship between porn and assault came up in several responses. I hear all of you! I've been groomed myself at the age of 15.  We have every right to call for change and those who cannot understand it are just fortunate to not have made those experiences!   \n **If you can look at porn websites and not be triggered: GOOD FOR YOU!** But listen to those who have been assaulted as a teen by older men,  or by step-siblings or step-parents. Etc. Listen to those who have been sexualized. \n* To those saying media is a reflection of society, therefore you cannot change what it reflects. Well, **the relationship with media is a two way street: Yes, Media reflects our society. But media also shapes our society.** And in that media and language in media are powerful tools.   \nSo yes, Porn tagged teen reflects that teens are sexualized. \n   * Just 15 years ago media could OPENLY address the 18th birthday of female actors and singers and make creepy comments. Those comments still happen but have luckily received much backlash in public. \n   * Ironically, there was post in a non-English about porn consumption. Many men commented that they have stopped watching porn as they realized how it impacted the expectations and behaviors around sex which they took over without wanting or realizing at first.\n* So, to everyone calling cancel culture and censorship. You have not realized that these words have no place on porn web sites. It is also NOT the ban the content it self, but to apply an appropriate  language. **That's cultural change not cancel culture nor censorship.** \n* Are you afraid someone could take your porn tag away, and you would be less aroused when looking for porn: **Congratulations you have realized the influence of language on your sexual desire!** \n* The concept of age and what's being a teen has been discussed. I figured that those constructs are also **culturally influenced**. So whether or not you'd commonly consider 18 or 19 year old ( not porn related) as teens might be a cultural aspect as well. On the other hand, some of those comments have been quite telling. I still stand with my point: teen is not a porn appropriate  term. Young adult is appropriate. \n* Yes I am thinking of starting a petition and to connect with people from scientific fields (language, social studies etc.).  I am thinking of ways in which the relationship could be tested. DM this is something you also think about. \n* and finally. yes. I am OKAY thank you weird Redditor who send the reddit concern bot. are you though? I think I know how it was and I think your reaction is quite telling. \n* Thank you Mods, for watching over and Thank ALL of you for reporting harassment and arguing respectfully!  \n\n* Finally: I am beyond grateful that our society is becoming more and more reflective on media and language that surrounds us. When I was 20, I don't think this would have received the same response! We came this far and we will get even further!   \n","title":"'Teen' should be banned as a title or tag for porn on any porn website.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/ua4hdy\/teen_should_be_banned_as_a_title_or_tag_for_porn\/","upvote_ratio":0.69,"over_18":false}

I\u2019m frustrated by the lengths that we have to go to in order to keep ourselves safe that were suggested here (using a masculine name, keeping men\u2019s clothes in my apartment, etc). \n\nI contacted DoorDash last night after this happened. Since then, I\u2019ve emailed with someone from community response team, who had this response below:\n\n\u201cThis sounds like it was a frightening incident and we appreciate you alerting us of this in such detail. This sort of behavior is a violation of our Community Guidelines and something we do not tolerate here at DoorDash. We want to assure you that we have investigated this incident and taken immediate and appropriate action by removing them from receiving any of your future deliveries to ensure the continued safety of our community.\u201d \n\nI asked for clarification, but it sounds like DoorDash has not removed the account the Dasher was using, only blocked the Dasher\u2019s account from picking up any of my future orders. I\u2019m really disappointed, but not shocked, that more isn\u2019t being done about this issue. \n\nMost businesses and roads are shut down due to the winter weather, so I will be checking with them tomorrow (if the weather has cleared) for security camera footage of the parking lot.\n\n-\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nOrdered DoorDash as a part of my company\u2019s dinner policy tonight. I\u2019ve done this many times and never had a driver have issues parking in the public garage of my apartment lot or get lost. The apartment complex has large, lit signs and clear arrows pointing into the parking lot off of a major road. Both Google and Apple Maps will route you there correctly and the garage is well lit and equipped with cameras. I\u2019ve never felt unsafe meeting someone here. \n\nMy dasher, \u201cJessica\u201d texted me that she was in the parking lot for businesses next door, to come quickly because it\u2019s cold, and that she had my food ready. I jogged over to the parking lot with my boyfriend and it was pitch dark, except for the car\u2019s headlights being on.\n\nWe came around the side of the car and saw there was a man in the driver\u2019s seat, alone, with his pants down. He quickly pulled up his pants in the driver\u2019s seat and threw our order at us before peeling out of the parking lot. \n\nMy name is very clearly feminine on my account. The Dasher also had a very clearly feminine name. I didn\u2019t mention that someone was coming with me to get my food. The Dasher asked me to meet them in a dark, odd place. I keep trying to think of ways that I might have misconstrued this situation in my head, but I think something bad would\u2019ve happened if my boyfriend hadn\u2019t come with me. \n\nI\u2019ve escalated this to DoorDash and they\u2019re supposed to call me later. I feel sick to my stomach about what could\u2019ve happened and I hope this helps warn other people.","title":"I can\u2019t use DoorDash anymore.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/10plndg\/i_cant_use_doordash_anymore\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false}

At least, I didn\u2019t until I was raped. \n\n\nI\u2019m a college girl in  Southern Colorado in a really small town, and it was Halloween night. Both me and a friend were drugged and raped. I vaguely remember the assault, but nothing significant. I could put the pieces together because my nipple piercings hurt and so did my vagina. A day later I told my mom, and she told me to go to the er to get tested. \n\n\nWhen I went to the ER they do something called a SANE (sexual assault nurse examination ) exam. Basically, I was stuck in the ER for 8 hours while they took my blood, gave me preventative STI meds and shots, and asked me over and over what happened. They asked if I wanted police or photo evidence taken (I declined both) \n\n\nThe actual examination is the worst part. The nurse took me into a bright room that was cold and scary. She had me strip everything off on a potty pad for dogs to collect any skin cells. I changed into a gown and she examined every single inch of my body for any bruising. She took fingernail clippings, hair follicles, and mouth swabs. \n\nThe hardest part for me was the female exam because that\u2019s where I had the most trauma, so it was really painful. She took some swabs and used a blue dye on the tearing I had. After everything she explained to me the trauma she found and oh my god it\u2019s so hard to hear. I don\u2019t remember anything and hearing what she found tore me apart. My mom was in the room with me and she started to cry. She never cries. \n\n\nThe nurse sent me home with a huge stack of information and things that I had to do. I was on preventative HIV meds for an entire month. These meds make you SICK. I could t even leave my bed without constantly throwing up. I felt like I was dying it was so bad. They give you headaches, extreme nausea, and body aches. \nIt\u2019s not over after that. I had to check up with an infectious disease doctor. I have to get tested for HIV next week, again in three months, six months, and then a year. \n\nThe men that did this to me have probably forgotten it by now. But I haven\u2019t. Because of them, I\u2019m going to be stuck getting prodded with needles for an entire year, while all these doctors talking to me are looking at my like I\u2019m. Helpless victim. \n\nRape isn\u2019t something that you can get over quickly. I\u2019m gonna have to deal with this shit for a year, probably more. I just wanted to voice my frustration with my situation... \n\n\nEdit: thank you all for the support. It was so hard to talk about, but i think it\u2019s important people know the realities of rape. The trauma is so long term. \n\nI also wanted to say that I chose not to report because it\u2019s terrifying. I\u2019m honestly scared to find out who did this to me, and see their faces. This choice doesn\u2019t make sense, but it\u2019s my choice. I also don\u2019t have a good history with the police.

I have my own experience that I don\u2019t really talk about very much because it\u2019s still so painful, but I feel that it\u2019s important to talk about what happened and how everything went wrong because I don\u2019t want anyone to ever have to go through the same hellish experiences that I\u2019ve gone through for the last 5 years.\n\nI was training for my first triathlon in the summer of 2015, I spent a lot of time outdoors and was working on upping my cycling times. I went out on a nice Sunday evening but what I didn\u2019t know was that some jackass put a trip wire on the trail at a downhill 90 degree turn. I struck it at nearly 25 mph. I had a lot of injuries all of which were minimized or missed completely. They missed a skull fracture (that one almost killed me and I ended up getting emergency surgery later at another hospital a few days later) and minimized my orthopedic injuries. I had fractures from my heel to my femur in my left leg and all I got told was that I had a badly sprained ankle. I kept insisting that something was wrong and I wanted an MRI \u2013 I have never felt pain like that before (or since) and I could not stop crying. We were sent home anyway.\n\nI was in physical therapy for a year solid without any real improvements. They kept telling me that my pain shouldn\u2019t have been that bad, that I just wasn\u2019t trying and that I was faking my lack of mobility because I didn\u2019t do the exercises. It really damaged my soul to hear those things because I knew something was wrong the whole time \u2013 I couldn\u2019t bend my toes, had foot drop, and a deep, sharp pain that never went away. I went through four orthopedic surgeons who didn\u2019t even want to do x-rays much less an MRI even though my left leg was misshaped and atrophied. I got labeled a liar and overdramatic which didn\u2019t help in finding a physician that would listen.\n\nI was fortunate that I didn\u2019t give up and found a surgeon who suggested a nerve study and did an MRI \u2013 turns out I was right all along. My ankle was a mess of poorly healed fractures, avascular necrosis, and all the major nerves in my leg died about mid-calf (likely from undetected compartment syndrome \u2013 kinda lucky I didn\u2019t die). I literally wept with relief because I finally knew what was wrong and that it wasn\u2019t my fault \u2013  but it couldn\u2019t be fixed. Too much time had passed for a nerve graft to be useful and I was starting to develop tumors on the tissue that was still damaged and slowly dying. We tried to salvage it for a few years, but eventually it was just a losing battle and I had an amputation last year.\n\nI\u2019m doing relatively well and am in a lost less pain now, but I still have a lot of built up anger that I don\u2019t think is going anywhere anytime soon. My wife and I tried to go after malpractice with the help of our health insurance company but even they said that it would be too difficult since the burden of proving knowing negligence was on us. That and with tort reform in Texas it would end up costing us more than any restitution we\u2019d be able to get. So, we\u2019re kinda just stuck eating the cost of prosthesis care which is estimated to add up to about 300-500k over the course of my lifetime.\n\nI still sometimes feel like I could have done something different \u2013 that maybe if I had been louder or more insistent that someone would have listened. So I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s really any good advice I can give other than be persistent, have someone there who can help you advocate for yourself, and that there are independent or insurance provided patient advocates that can be helpful if you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being listened to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I keep getting advice to sue, and we've tried. My wife is an attorney and her law firm has referred us to other firms multiple times and we've also spoken with attornies from our health insurance - none of them have recommended pursuing it for a variety of reasons. We don't have the money to take on a hospitals legal team. That and the last time we requested my full medical records from the hospital they said they didn't have them - we've also filled paperwork against the hospital for not keeping the records for the required 7 year period in our state. So all we have are the discharge papers and a disc with my broke elbow on it but none of the other x-rays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: I called up my wife to ask about maybe pursuing this again, and she told me that we could try but we're now up against the statute of limitation for filing a medical malpractice claim - which is two years in Texas.

The copper IUD is the only option really so I set up an appointment to have it inserted. It was free with my insurance! I was not told to prepare in any way, I was not warned at all or advised to plan around this. Even the internet did not give me an inkling of the pain associated with the procedure.\n\nI drove myself to the appointment. I took no Advil. My doctor told me I would feel \u201csome pressure\u201d and some \u201cmild cramping similar to menstrual cramps\u201d that would be \u201cgone by the time you leave.\u201d\n\nThe actual placement was the single most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. The first time since childhood that I actually involuntarily screamed from pain.

I felt ashamed and poked at and violated. \n\nWhen I was finally able to go I had to drive home by myself (stick shift so lots of abdominal engagement fml), and to this day I don\u2019t know how I made it. The next 3 days were the worst cramps I\u2019ve ever experienced and pooping was a nightmare. \n\nIt seems to be a theme that women are under informed about these things, and frequently not given pain killer when it would be appropriate.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else experienced this, or if my pain was worse than normal. I hope this doesn\u2019t scare people away from IUDs, as I do think it was worth not having to take the pill every day.

He's beautiful! He a boxer? HEY! Lemme see!\"\n\nI walked faster and hoped they couldn't see my legs shaking. Last thing I heard was, \"We were only being FRIENDLY, BITCH,\" and the scream of their tires.\n\nAnd in that moment, I felt a pang of guilt. *For being \"mean\" to those two men.* Seriously.

He asks me out on a date, I accept.  We get along swimmingly.   We've been dating for about 3 weeks and it's getting on time for sex... it feels natural and right.  We are both a bit older past that time in life where we jump in bed right away so this is a planned activity.  He's going to spend the night for the first time.  For me, this is a big step with someone.\n\n Now I'm going to tell you that part of this is completely MY fault because we didn't discuss protection beforehand.. but my gosh it's 2019, aren't condoms a given nowadays?  We did discuss STD's and we both said we didn't have any and the last time we'd been tested. \n\nAnyhoo.. things are going hot and heavy and like the girl scout I am, I reach into the nightstand and pull out a condom.\n\nHe said, \"WTF is that for?\" \n\n::RECORD SCRATCH:: \n\nI knew *immediately* that this was going to be an issue and that I'd made a mistake.   He wanted to discuss it in bed, but I insisted we gather our clothing back on and head out to the living room for a discussion.\n\nHis attitude was snarky, condescending and his words were designed to make ME feel bad about insisting on condoms.   He couldn't *believe* that I didn't trust him.  How could I have sex with him if I didn't trust him 100%?  (HA!)   \n\nHonestly, if I had ANY small amount of trust for someone I met 3 weeks ago it'd certainly gone out the window with this display.  Who the hells knows what you have or your recent partners might because you are obviously into high risk sex.   \n\nHis next tactic is trying to convince me that \"Safety is an illusion\" that I was being stupid, illogical, and an overly-cautious, silly female. \n\nI said, \"Has that actually worked for you before? Because that's the most bullshit thing I ever heard.  Life is full of risks, so nothing is ever 100% safe but it's perfectly reasonable and logical to at least take precautions.   Do you wear a seatbelt in the car? Safety glasses if you are using a saw? A helmet for riding a bike?  Those activities can kill you but you still use reasonable precautions, right?   The very fact that you are trying to make me feel crazy and wrong for wanting you to wear a condom lets me know we are never going to be compatible and you can fuck right off. Seriously. \" \n\nI walked over to the front door, opened it and said, \"Please leave.  Now.\" \n\nHe asked if this meant I was breaking it off with him.  Hell yes, I am.  He said he \"couldn't believe it that I would break it off over something so trivial\" and was refusing to leave. \n\nThe chutzpah of this guy just pissed me off.   Yeah, my health, so fucking trivial dude.  \n\nI grabbed his overnight bag and the shirt he'd brought on a hanger and threw them out into the hallway. \"I'm not wasting another breathe on you, asshole.  Get out NOW or I'm calling the cops.\"\n\nHe did finally leave and I immediately locked the door, blocked his phone number and  email address and haven't spoken to him since.  \n\nGood riddance to bad rubbish.\n\nThe crazy thing is that his responses and arguments were something that he's practiced before.  He was too slick and too prepared.    He's done this before, maybe a bunch of times before.  \n\nLadies - don't fall for ANY of that shit and let them make you feel bad or crazy or unreasonable for sticking up for yourself.    The slightest push back or excuse on this issue is a giant red flag.  Your body and your health are worth it.\n\n\nBye Felipe!\n\n\n\nEdit:  Oh dear, I'm getting  PM's asking me where I'm located because they have a friend\/brother\/whatever named Felipe and want to ream their ass out for being a jerk.

The right lump was large enough to ultrasound and biopsy (benign, yay!) but the left lump was too small to do much about. I vividly remember the day all of this happened because 1) it wasn't that long ago, and 2) I am 32 and definitely not the average age group for this.\n\nWell today when I go in with the tech to get my mammogram, she tells me we are only scanning my right breast. I say that's incorrect, they are scanning both. She double checks my file and says no, look right here- it says your left breast was totally fine.\n\nThis back and forth continues for TWO HOURS.\n\nShe checks with a nurse. Then the doctor at the imaging center. Then I call my doctor who referred me in the first place. Everyone is telling me that my file says my left breast was totally normal and needed no further scanning.\n\nI say at least a dozen times: *I don't know what to tell you, the file is wrong. I was told we needed to make sure nothing got bigger in my left breast.*\n\nI was belittled. I was treated like I was being hysterical and difficult. It was insinuated I was making things harder for other patients who \"need access to the mammogram\" (as if I was personally holding the machine hostage...? What? I offered to wait in the waiting room, you weirdo??) and worst of all I was told if I got an \"unnecessary\" scan then my insurance wouldn't cover it and I'd be stuck with the bill. I'm in grad school. That's a terrifying reality. But fine, I said. I'll pay full cost. Do both breasts.\n\nThe tech did it and was so annoyed with me the entire time I could feel it just radiating off of her. I was wasting her time and she sure didn't mind letting me know it.\n\nTen minutes after they finally scanned BOTH breasts, a different tech called me into a consultation room and told me: **you have a concerning mass in your left breast and we need you to come back this afternoon for an ultrasound.**\n\nI immediately burst into tears. I'm terrified that there has been *that* amount of growth in just a few months- enough to warrant an ultrasound when that definitely was not the case last time. But mostly I'm proud of myself. I'm so proud I pushed. I'm so proud I advocated for myself.  Even though I cried the entire time and felt like an idiot and absolutely had OTHER SHIT TO DO TODAY. I'm proud.\n\nAnd if I see that tech when I go back in two hours for my ultrasound, I will say nothing. Because she must feel like shit.\n\nUPDATE: No need for biopsy, doc says it\u2019s nothing. I am so tired and want to forget this awful day. Thank you all for the kind words.\n\nUPDATE 2: It's after 7pm where I am- my doctor just called and she is PIISSEDDDD. The disconnect that happened was a logistical issue that was made 10000% worse by the folks working at the imaging center- she was as baffled as I was that no one just freaking called her. When I called her office to try to figure out what was happening I had to talk to 80 different nurses and everything took way too long because a patient is not a great go-between when trying to explain medical stuff. The imaging center people should have called. My doctor ended up CALLING IN A MAMMOGRAM FOR MY LEFT BREAST. NO ONE AT THE IMAGINING CENTER TOLD ME THIS!!! \n\nShe's also angry they didn't describe the results of the ultrasound very well: they found a cyst and they also saw that my lymph node was enlarged. I was not told that. She says the results are \"gray area\" enough, and I am young enough, that it makes sense they didn't explain well\/take it super seriously, but also she would fully support me in getting a second opinion and filing a formal complaint if I so wish. Based on the mess that was today, plus the fact that I have a grandparent that died of breast cancer (we also have bone and colon cancer just all up in my immediate family)- I'm going to meet with her soon and discuss what I'd like to do- both with my healthcare and with reporting the tech. \n\nI'm looking forward to sitting down very soon with a warm and helpful medical professional who supports me and can help me figure out my options. I feel so much better. Thank god she called me. \n\nSIDE NOTE: For insurance purposes, does it matter that she called in the mammogram AFTER they had already done it? From what my doctor says it sounds like they called it in before the imaging folks even told me I needed an ultrasound- so that's a ten-minute window max. How significant is the timing here? \nThank you for any advice.","title":"I fought for an \"extra mammogram\" and I was right","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/jj68p0\/i_fought_for_an_extra_mammogram_and_i_was_right\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false}

It also dried me up and killed my libido. \n\nThat\u2019s when I learned of his impatience. \n\nHe never took the time to talk to me about why I might not want to have sex. He didn\u2019t care that I might have shooting, cramping pain if I did it when I wasn\u2019t ready. He was selfish. He was concerned that I wasn\u2019t attracted to him so he would lash out, then give me the silent treatment if I didn\u2019t want to have sex. He was always minimizing everything about how I might feel. Cramping? Oh, try getting kicked in the balls! Spare me with that shit. \n\nEvery weekend morning, it was either right when my eyes opened, or whenever he deemed that I should be awake, he would start groping me. I am not a morning person, you don\u2019t wake me before I am ready because it legit ruins my whole day. I either had to let him grope me until we had sex or I gave him some sort of job. I would be pissy beyond belief that I was being handled at such an hour when all I wanted to do was slowly wake up, scroll through reddit, and listen to the birds chirp. \n\nIf I said no, he would roll over and give me the silent treatment, then he\u2019d leave me for the entire day almost immediately.

I needed a place to organize my thoughts and as a long time lurker here, I feel pretty safe letting you in on what just happened. \n\nMy husband and I have been together 12 years. He was born and raised in an extremely rough area of the Midwest and as a young black man, he was affiliated with the wrong crowds. He left that life 25 years ago and has not looked back. All that to say, when I met him 12 years ago, he wasn\u2019t the most open minded man. I would say borderline homophobic. We have had A LOT of conversations regarding gay people in general, he\u2019s learned a lot, we have a lot of LBGTQ friends, and his views have changed drastically to the opposite of where he was. \n\nHusband has a daughter (14) that lives across the country from us. Through a series of unfortunate events, they are not as close as husband would hope. He chats with her as often as he can and the door is wide open for her to come live with us. \n\nOut of the blue tonight I looked her up on FB. Husband doesn\u2019t use social media but he asked if I could find her so he could see more current pictures. In her description, she mentions she is pan and trans. I tried to break it to him as easy and best as possible but he grabbed the phone from me.\n\nY\u2019all...my heart...this man who was filled with so much hate 12 years ago, broke down into tears! I was shocked and not sure what to do. I started to console him but he said they are HAPPY tears! \u201cI\u2019m just so happy I raised my child to be so strong and comfortable being who she is!\u201d \n\nI just....I have no words. We talked for a long time about the whole thing. Lots of tears. He drafted a text to her saying he loves her so much and nothing could ever change that. He told me \u201cI\u2019ll wear rainbows and go to pride parades!\u201d Lol We want her to come to us on her own with the information and to know we are here with open arms. \n\nI\u2019m so overwhelmed and more in love with my husband than I ever thought possible.

I worked quite hard for it and I'm very proud of it. \nThere is a boy in my class who's crazy about physics. \n\nThere is friendly competition between us but so far I seem to be the clear cut winner in math and we are about the same level in physics.\n\nNow, This guy spends his life studying physics and math. It's a respectable hobby. \n\n\nHowever here comes my problem.\nEveryone in my class is convinced that I am the hardworking girl and he is the gifted smart boy.\n\n\nNo one will ever say that I'm smart. No. I'm just hardworking. I just work hard. Nothing more.\n\nHe works more than I do. I get better results. He is gifted. He is very smart.\n\n\nA few days ago we were talking and I complimented his intelligence. He told me in return \"You are not smart, but you work hard. It's respectable.\"\n\nI couldn't keep myself from just blurting out\n\"Fuck you. I'm smart.\" \nI finally felt like I was about to explode. I asked him to class the people in our class by their intelligence. He put every boy before me. \n\nFuck it. I don't care if I'm labelled crazy narcissistic for thinking I'm smart. He can go around boast about his intelligence no problem. I can't. I don't care.\n\nThing is I'm not alone. Every girl I meet thinks that their sucess is hard work while boys think it's their intelligence. We work equally.\n\n\nFuck this mentality. Yes I work hard. But yes I'm also smart. As smart as a boy.\n\nEdit 1: Hey I really didn't think this would blow up! So to clarify some things: I'm not mad at the boy. He is actually a friend of mine. I am mad about the mentality that we have. We are still friends with him and I think I now have the courage to talk to people about this instead of responding with a \"fuck you\". I believe my post came off pretty aggressive, and with a second read I see I should have made myself clearer. \n\nEdit 2: After going through the comments I see some themes getting repeated often:\n\nYeah, just like everyone I do care what people think of me. I should grow a thicker skin that's for sure. But this mentality goes deep and we should tell girls that they are smart! It's hard to just live in your own bubble!\n\nAnd does school work show off intelligence? Well not really! But nothing does!\n\nWhen I say that I am smart I don't mean smarter than others. Just like everyone can be beautiful in their own way, everyone can be smart in their own way! I am good with academics, others are good with music, others with social skills.

The professor told her that she has to wear a sports bra because she'll need to take her shirt off, and she is (understandably) not comfortable doing that in front of a bunch of guys. She said that she'll fail the lab if she doesn't do it. I told her to refuse to do it and go to the head of the department or the dean of students and explain the situation.\n\nSorry for the long post and any bad formatting (I'm on mobile), but I just wanted to vent and get your thoughts and opinions on the situation because I think it is absolutely ridiculous that she's being put in this situation to begin with.\n\nEdit: I was not expecting this to get so much attention, so thank you all for all of your replies! Apparently the class is not today but tomorrow so I will update you on what happens\n\nEdit 2: Okay so I just talked to my girlfriend and got a better understanding of the situation. There are actually two instructors for the lab and they're both males around 25 years old. I was incorrect about her being the only female in the class. The instructors split the class into two groups for this and her group is mostly male football players with a few other females. The instructors chose her to be the example because the other females are apparently \"bigger\" and the instructors don't want to make them uncomfortable (but apparently it's okay for my girlfriend to be \/s). The instructors did not say that she would fail if she refused to be the example, but she is afraid that she'll lose points. My girlfriend also told me that the instructors usually mess with her in class (not in a bad way, but how teachers do with students they like), and now they chose her to be the example for this.\n\nAs you can tell, I am obviously not okay with this but she most definitely is not either. She decided that she is going to refuse to be the example and if anything negative comes of it she'll go to higher-ups.\n\n\nFinal edit: Sorry for taking so long to reply, I've been really busy with work. \n\nSo my girlfriend had the class yesterday and when she got there her sugar got low (she's a type 1 diabetic), so she left to go get something to eat. By the time she got back to class another girl had volunteered to be the example. So in the end she didn't have to be the example, and the instructors didn't even make her participate because of her sugar.\n\nI know a lot of people think I exaggerated the whole situation for attention but I honestly just misunderstood what she had originally told me, so I apologise for that.\n\nTL;DR: my girlfriend didn't have to take her shirt off and I need to understand situations better before I post about them.","title":"Girlfriend asked to take shirt off for class","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/9r0izv\/girlfriend_asked_to_take_shirt_off_for_class\/","upvote_ratio":0.84,"over_18":false}

I woke up to hundreds of congratulatory comments, as well as a bunch of PMs from guys who didn't want to post anything publicly but still wanted to let me know that my story, and the many similar stories in the comments, were proof that 'females' were working together to keep 'men' down.  I apparently stole my new job from some hard working man out there who went the traditional route of getting the education and experience required.  One guy even gleaned from my comment history that I'm childless by choice and married, and therefore don't even need a high paying job, and it's women like me that are keeping the unemployment rate for men higher than women (?!?!).\n\nSo first of all, skyrocketing housing prices in my area of Canada definitely require two substantial incomes, regardless of any other point.  But more importantly, and I can't stress this enough, there is NOT a finite number of jobs out there.  When more people (aka women as well as men) work, more people have more money to spend, which they generally do, and therefore more products and services are required and more jobs are created.  When jobs go to the right person, regardless of their background, that company does better and... well, tbh shareholders probably make more money, but hopefully other companies are forced to hire more qualified people to compete.\n\nWe aren't enemies, I promise!  Speaking from a personal level, I am married to a wonderful man whom I try to support in every way, and (and this is the thing to remember) he does the same for me.  Speaking more generally, I guarantee that you have more in common with the various women in your community and workplaces than you think.  Working conditions are pretty shitty right now (check out antiwork, workreform, latestagecapitalism, etc).  Trust me, it's not women who are your enemy.  We really aren't' working to keep you down.\n\nI know that you aren't the silent majority that you might think.  In fact, the ratio of angry PMs to supportive comments (and PMs) indicates that you are actually part of a very vocal but very small minority.  I just hope for your own sake as well as the sake of the women around you that you can learn to realize this.","title":"To the scared, angry guys who lurk here, can I just gently but firmly remind you that female empowerment does not mean male disenfranchisement?

He has been frustrated recently, and has made comments about our lack of a sex life.\n\nFrom my perspective he hasn't been interested, and I attributed that to my weight gain and I told him so. He then brought up several occasions where he tried to \"come on to me\" and I shoved him away. Examples include trying to take my towel off after I came out of the shower, trying to snuggle up to me in bed and I refused to allow him to touch me under the blankets, etc.\n\nI had truly been thinking that he found me repulsive and I was actually considering telling him to sleep with other women (he takes care of himself... still in great shape after 20 years of marriage) but when I said to him \"you have a problem with me being fat\" he looked me dead in the eye and said \"I don't have a problem with you being fat. YOU have a problem with you being fat.\"\n\nAnd he's right. He has never made me feel unattractive or unworthy... He is still very much attracted to me and it's my own self conscious that has prevented me from being intimate with him because I feel like I'm less than he deserves.

Today I went to the doctor to inquire about it & it was an emotional disaster. As soon as my PA came in she asked if I was sexually active which I said yes as I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for nearly 3 years. She said that I must most likely be pregnant despite receiving 2 negative at home tests already and how I need a blood test to confirm next. Then she started telling me that I need to face the consequences of being sexually active & in verbatim \u201cthese things happen when you\u2019re not married\u201d. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed and wish I never confided in her to begin with. \n\nI have a history of ED that she is aware of and prior to this have had issues in being incredibly fatigued\/loss of appetite\/possible anemia, I\u2019m very underweight (85 lbs) as well. She kept implying that the only explanation is that i\u2019m pregnant and said every time these blood tests come back they\u2019re positive (from last patients). While I think it\u2019s very plausible this could be something else due to my other medical history\/problems. My boyfriend and I are incredibly safe and always use a condom and he never cums inside me on top of that. I told her this and she still was saying how you can never be too certain and that I still most definitely will be pregnant.\n\nI was very distressed and started crying. In which she asked \u201cwhy?\u201d, I told her because I\u2019m scared about my Dads opinion as the blood test will show up on his insurance. She immediately said \u201cohh.... you\u2019re not scared of your Mom\u2019s opinion?\u201d. I awkwardly replied that my parents are divorced in which she apologized that they\u2019re divorced (???). I don\u2019t even know how bringing up my mother was relevant besides shaming me more.\n\nAre my feelings valid? I cant help but keep crying reflecting on this interaction I just had. I would appreciate it so much if someone replied. I would hope that medical professionals are someone you can confide but that was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.\n\nedit: After reading many of the comments, I believe I am going to try and report this.

They know what's being posted, and it is damn well affecting their mental health. \n\nI've spoken with so many kids who hear their parents complaining about being parents frequently. Who tell me that their parent can't help them with a reading task without a glass of wine. Kids who tell me that their parents are always frustrated with them. Kids who firmly believe that their parents don't like them. That they're annoying, a pain, bothersome. These comments are driving your kids away from you. They're exasperating your kids mental health. These comments\/posts\/overheard conversations are making your kids anxious about asking anything of you. These comments, even just in passing, are making a lot of kids feel worthless.\n\nThink about that for a moment. A 12 year old, who sees their parents posting online about needing wine to help them supervise homework time. Who hears parents talking about how the kids are bothersome. A 12 year who feels worthless because they truly believe their parents don't like them, that if they were somehow better, maybe their family would spend time together more often.\n\nI get it. You're busy, things are rough, work is hard, etc. Life is hard. Especially in a pandemic with an uncertain political climate, economy, and household financial situation. But your kids need you. They need to know you're there to support them. They need to know that no matter what, you've got their back. That you want them around. That you *like* them. Your kids are channeling all the stress we, as adults, are too, but they don't have the coping skills to really deal with it yet. They need extra love and care. They need extra reassurance. They need all the positives that come from family and support. If they don't find it at home, they'll start looking in other places for it.\n\nPlease spend some actual quality time with your kids, not just being in the same room. Please stop complaining about them in places they can overhear\/read. Please be there for them. They need you.\n\nAlso, this isn't one or two kids, this is dozens over the months through the spring and so far this fall. Your kids need more support than ever right now. They need you and your love for them. They need to feel it, see it, and believe it.\n\nP.S. I'm not saying you can't, or shouldn't, have adult conversations, be honest, and get support from your adult friends, you definitely should. Just not in public spaces accessible by your children. They hear\/see it all. And it affects them.

Those 4-5 hours were great!\n\nWe then went to a resturant later in the day and when I got my drinks (water and a pink lemonade), I needed to go use the bathroom. But I didn't trust him enough to leave my drink unattended (because duh, it was our first time meeting). I tried to cover it with my cloth napkin but obviously - that wouldn't stop him if he tried to drug me. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI said how I'd just wait until I get home to use the bathroom (since the resturant was only a few minutes away from my house). When our waiter came back to us, my date proceeded to say to the waiter:\n\n\"Hey, it's our first date. Can you take her drinks and hold them while she goes to the bathroom and bring them back when she gets back?\"\n\nWHEN I TELL YOU IN MY HEAD MY JAW DROPPED!!!! I have NEVER had a guy do that for me before or I've never heard of any guy doing that with any woman before! I know some of you are probably thinking \"That's the bare minimum\". Well, he went out of his way to ask the waiter to HOLD MY DRINKS to assure me that I would be safe with him. That was amazing to me personally.\n\nWe had a great date and had another one tonight (Saturday). Looking forward to see where things go with him. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: HOLY SHIT! THIS IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF LIKES I'VE EVER GOTTEN! THANK YOU GUYS! I wanna mention a few things, though.\n\n1: I noticed there's some people that are concerned about the age gap. I never usually date people more than like 3 or 4 years older than me, but I wanted to try something different since my experience with men around my age have been awful.

As if this stuff doesn't happen everywhere in the world, especially the US, all the time - even with people you trust. Read some of the comments here of women saying their experiences of getting drugged and warning me. It obviously happens way more often then y'all think.\n\nSo thank you for the positive comments but I'm done. Have a great day everyone!

I have listed my symptoms over and over to 4 different doctors. I kept going to different doctors because I knew something was fucked up and no one would listen to me.

How they found it. A 25 year old female radiologist was giving me a sonogram on my kidneys that I asked my doctor to order because I have a 'significant' amount of blood in my urine. (He thought I didn't know when I got my period. I am 47 motherfucking years old, for the love of fuck.) She was half way through and when I flinched she said, \"That shouldn't hurt\" and called the doctor and asked for an order to run another test, which turned into another and another.  She did this while was I in the room, which I know isn't common and she also kept apologizing and saying, \"I am not a doctor, but...\". I am going to buy her a house.\n2. How I got the doctor to listen: I found that I had to do a very manipulative dance of humor,  self deprecation and firm forcefulness.  I stopped using phrases like: I don't know, maybe I was wrong, I don't remember exactly.  I had to state things very clearly and not wobble when I was doubted. When the doctor asked my if my feet ever get over-heated at night, I said, \"Yes\", he asked me I took the covers off to cool them down. I just looked at him until he realized that it was really stupid question. I have had blood in my urine with every doctor I saw. I had to manipulate the fourth into ordering the test for me.  If you are too pushy you are cut off, if you aren't pushy enough you are dismissed.  As I read all of these I kept thinking how grateful I am that my mother was pushy, bossy, loud and just did what she needed to do.

She got to school yesterday and started to feel sick. She realized by 9am and was just entering music class. She asked her teacher if she could go to the bathroom and the teacher replied with no, because she should have gone before she even got to her classroom. So my daughter went and sat back down. A couple minutes in and she realized she was going to vomit.. so she asked the teacher again and told her she was going to throw up. This teacher told her to take the trash can in the hallway. My daughter proceeded to throw up and have a bowel movement at the exact same time right outside the classroom in a hallway where the kids in her class could hear and see. \n\nI\u2019m livid, do I have a right to be? \n\nHere are my reasonings for feeling this way:\n\n-Making a young child go into a hallway right outside the classroom with a trash can violates her privacy at the very least. Kids at this age are mean and could hear or see anything happening. Allowing them to bully her for the rest of the time in school for something that she could not control. \n\n-Girls at this age in particular should not feel ashamed or scared to ask to go to the bathroom in lieu of life changes. What if she had started or something? Does she need to announce it to leave or are you just going to allow her to bleed through her pants? \n\n-We now live in a brand new normal with Covid fading out, but one of the biggest symptoms being vomiting or nausea. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think or say, all I know is watching my daughter cry in the car sitting next to me over something she had no control over made my blood boil. What would you all do in my situation? If I decide to call the school, is there any advice you could give me for what to say or how to react? I don\u2019t want to make her time harder or more embarrassing but I also want to stand up and protect my child. Help please.\n\nEdit: I just want to say thank you for all the replies and advice here. I especially want to thank all of the teachers for commenting on guidelines and school policies that I wouldn\u2019t have had a clue about before. That definitely educated me. I did contact the school earlier to set up a phone meeting with the principal but have heard nothing back at this time. I have written many questions and statements directly from you all regarding what happened so that I can remain calm but clearly get my point across about how upset I am by either policies or judgement or both. \n\nMy daughter is at home today and still kind of physically exhausted from a stomach bug going around. She has eaten more today and stayed hydrated and is on the mend, so thank you to everyone who offered kindness. She and I will have a talk later about this more in depth. And how she has the right to use the bathroom, especially in emergency situations. That\u2019s been such a big take away from all of you.","title":"My daughter\u2019s school potentially humiliated her in front of her class.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/tmdwpo\/my_daughters_school_potentially_humiliated_her_in\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false}

Ironically, I was actually picked on when I first started for choosing to dress more modestly by wearing tights under my shorts because during the fall and winter it can get cold in the store. \n\nI am not the only person who regularly does not wear a bra to work. Many of us are girls in our teens and twenties and we\u2019ve never had a customer complaint about any of us looking inappropriate for not wearing one. The t-shirts we wear are not very form fitting and are a thicker cotton blend. I choose to only wear black and grey shirts because it just feels more comfortable to me. I, in my opinion, no way looked provocative or revealing. \n\nThe company I work for is really conservative and I work in a more conservative area, despite marketing as a fun and edgy company. Lots of behaviors like harassment, verbal abuse, racism, etc. often go unpunished until they fear there will be a lawsuit. \n\nMy manager and a back of house worker decided when I came in today that I looked inappropriate even though I wear the exact same outfit multiple times a week.

After the first time we had sex he kept pestering me about how much \"better\" it feels to have sex without a condom, trying to convince me that the pull out method is reliable and that he's \"good at it.\" I told him no, that I refuse to have sex without a condom because of the risk of STI's and pregnancy especially because I am not on birth control can't be for various medical reasons. He kept trying to convince me otherwise and it was almost like he was trying to make me feel stupid and inexperienced for \"thinking\" that the pull out method isn't reliable (even though it is an objective fact that it's very unsafe). Eventually, he agreed to keep using condoms and we moved on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, after that conversation, I should have never spoken to this guy again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next time he came over we started making out doing all the usual foreplay stuff and I was feeling decently comfortable with the whole situation. When it came time to have sex, he put a condom on and it was all fine and good. I started feeling a bit off when I was on top of him in reverse cowgirl (or whatever it's called) and he started trying to finger my butt without asking. I told him to stop and he stopped, which was fine I guess, but I honestly wasn't that amused. We kept going after that, but when he was about to come I was in a position where I couldn't really see what was going on down there and then before I knew it he was coming on my chest with no condom on and was acting like he didn't know where it went. It sounded like he was reading a script. \"Oh my god, where the condom go. I don't know what happened... blah blah blah\" as he haphazardly looked around for the condom. I did NOT consent to have sex without a condom. In fact, I EXPLICITLY stated on multiple occasions that I REFUSE to have sex without a condom, and he STILL did that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so stunned in that moment and my immediate thought was \"oh my god, he does this to girls all the time doesn't he.\" I didn't believe for a SECOND that it was an accident. Condoms don't just slip off like that, and it was ESPECIALLY suspicious that he came on my chest. He had to have known that the condom wasn't on in order to do that, and who even knows how long he was going without it on. I felt so gross as I was cleaning myself up, just dreading the inevitable doctor's appointments and thinking about taking Plan B. I barely said anything to him, and I was scared to say anything because I didn't feel like having him to try to gaslight me into questioning the reality of the situation, or tell me that \"it's not a big deal\" because CLEARLY he has never stopped for even a split second to think about it from the woman's perspective. He hung out for another hour afterward much to my displeasure and I was angry, scared, and on the verge of tears the whole time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can't believe that there are people out there that have such little regard for others and I feel so disgusted. Nobody deserves to have their bodily autonomy and consent violated like that.\n\nI just wanted to vent because it has felt pretty shitty having people ask me how my weekend was and saying that it was \"fine\" even though I was dealing with this bullshit because I just don't feel like explaining what happened and I don't want to be judged for my poor decision making even though I never do stuff like this.

At the age of 15 I was diagnosed with MRKH. It is a condition where mullerian tissue, the stuff that makes the vaginal canal and uterus, doesn't form. Above is a diagram of what my anatomy would look like. I still have xx chromosomes, ovaries, labia, and a normal hormonal cycle. However I do not have a period, and can't get pregnant. Most girls with MRKH don't even find out untill 16ish area when they don't start their period, because from the outside they look completely normal. It is believed 1 in 4,500 girls have it in other words it isn't as rare as you may think.  \n\nSexism has made this diagnosis all the harder. Living in a world where a large portion of a womans worth is attributed to body parts I do not have, and things (ie pregnacy, and penetrative sex) I can not do is really hard to deal with. \n\n Then there is menstration. I ofcourse feel lucky not to have to go through the pain of periods, but at the same time having them is so heavily equated with \"becoming a woman\" that I feel like a fraud calling myself one.\n\n It even effects my healthcare. Doctors immediately focus on treatment options to make sure girls can \"satisfy your future husband\", and in some countries girls are denied vaginal lengthening treatment until they have a man to marry. \n\n It isn't all bleak as there are some doctors that have worked on pionereering uterine transplants which is amazing. However, I will say after watching a women born without a womb have her own baby it really made me wonder why with all this advancement there is still no psychological component to treatment, and why there is so little research on if making vaginal canals really provides sexual pleasure. \n\n At the vulnerable age of 15 I was pushed to modify my body for the pleasure of a man I had never met, but never once did any doctor mention whether or not the treatment options would provide myself any pleasure. Never once did a doctor ask if I even wanted to pursue the painful process of vaginal lengthening. \n\nAfter my one and only specialist visit I was given hard plastic dilators and told to use them twice a day for the rest of my life as if that was supposed to fix the tremendous void in my life. I took my small vaginal dimple and over time stretched it to a length where I can have penetrative sex, but it was a painful process and sex is still really hard. \n\n I have often been shushed into silence, because sexual anatomy is taboo. However, I feel like if people could learn about the diverse body types the world would be a better place, and in the case of MRKH there is a lot to learn in terms of the sexism some think no longer exists.

I have always been pro-choice and have never been concerned about abortion from a religious perspective, but pregnancy (and the abortion I am grateful for) was still a traumatic experience for me. I had an IUD for two years at that point with no issues and was exploring sexual empowerment with my one and only partner. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, pregnancy meant I had to once again be presented with the choice to let my body be probed and hurt because I had a metaphorical gun against my head - if I had to continue with that pregnancy, I would have killed myself or caused permanent, potentially life-threatening injury to myself. Abortion saved my life, and it has saved the lives of countless others. \n\nThe choice to get an abortion is nothing like the choice to get ice cream, as many right-wing commentators have suggested; it is the choice to regain control over your body, something women and AFAB people are too often deprived of throughout our lives. So yes, I experience justified rage every time I hear someone promote anti-choice rhetoric - that is not only abuse by the state, it is a continuation of the violence targeted against women and AFAB people every single day.\n\n\nEdited for the following disclaimer: \n\nI do not want to contribute to fear-mongering through that quote and I apologize for not thinking that through thoroughly. Abortion is generally a simple, routine procedure with minimal risks and, as such, is nothing like the physical pain that would occur if an animal were to actually rip off their own leg.\n\nHOWEVER, that is not the experience for everyone - in my experience as a survivor of SA, I WAS that trapped animal; I genuinely would have considered accepting excruciating pain in another part of my body, fully clothed, over the experience of exposing my sexual organs, suffering mild, temporary pain there that triggered my trauma, and facing hormonal changes that further triggered my C-PTSD. I felt trapped like I did as a child, and I genuinely considered doing anything to avoid the experience of both pregnancy and abortion. This is NOT as simple as deconstructing shame and guilt from religious and political dogma.  Some people will experience trauma from, not only pregnancy, but the remedy that is an abortion. Going forward, I will keep learning how to raise awareness for reproductive justice through my story while trying not to incite additional fear regarding the risks of abortion for most people.

Somehow we started discussing the death penalty and then the discussion led to abortion. And then, out of nowhere, my sister turns off the tv, looks at me with a calm and gentle look in her eye and tells me that she had an abortion seven years ago. There is nothing going on in my brain. I look the woman I love the most in my life and the only thing I can ask is \u201cwho was the father, Luke (name changed)?\u201d.  Yes, it was her then boyfriend. Her workaholic, mean boyfriend who made her feel very bad about herself. Also: \u201cDo mom and dad know?\u201d Of course not, no. And all I could say was \u201cokay\u201d. And then we continued watching the documentary.\n\nOn the way home, I was completely numb. I was out of balance of how I didn\u2019t feel like I thought I should have felt. The conversation was nothing I ever thought it would be. I had always thought that I would immediately cut out the person who confessed me something so horrifying about themselves. But this was _my sister_.  My sister. The woman who paid for my every single living expense for 8 months when I had a rough patch in life, including a new laptop so I can continue my university work. My sister, who texts me every day funny things and wishes me a happy day. My sister, who literally rocked me in her arms when I was in my lowest point in my eating disorder. And then it hit me. She never told me this. She. never. told. me. this. \n\nHere's some background: I have been passionately pro-life my whole life. Our family is pro-life. I was one of those girls who posted things on social media and was participating in activism to end abortion. It was something that was so dear to me it was pretty much a part of my identity.\n\nWe haven\u2019t discussed this since that day. I simply can not open the conversation. But since that day, I have changed. The seed was planted in me two years ago when I saw my sister struggle with her pregnancy. But now it bloomed. \n\nI am happy she had that abortion.\n\nI am happy that today, she has her husband and her son. She would have been miserable, stuck with him. \n\nAnd I wanted to justify my thoughts to myself. I wanted to justify them so bad. It was different from other women who have abortions because\u2026 What? He was worse than the other fathers? No. He wasn\u2019t a drunk, he didn\u2019t abuse any other substance, he didn\u2019t beat her, he wasn\u2019t completely broke. But he wasn\u2019t a nice person, at all. Would my sister been worse off than the other women I have always thought should just be responsible for their actions? No. She had an education, they would have somehow managed the finances,  she wasn\u2019t _too_ young. She would definitely had managed to become a mother. Survived.\n\nBut here is the only difference... I love her. It wasn\u2019t meant to be her life, the life she lives nowadays is. And that\u2019s it. \n\nI am a hypocrite. \n\nI am ashamed of the way I have behaved in the past. \n\nI am glad she didn\u2019t tell me when I was 16.  I would have behaved like a monster. She knew I wasn\u2019t mature enough to process it then.  She has been watching the way I have behaved all these years, knowing what she knows, and she has forgiven me for that. I was never there for her, not one of us was, when she was always there for us. She felt so alone she had to do it all by herself. And now she trusted me with this. And I am so grateful for that.\n\nAll I want to say is: I am so sorry. \n","title":"Two weeks ago, I became pro-choice.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/b3ftpy\/two_weeks_ago_i_became_prochoice\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false}

We were studying and joking around together when this came out.  \n\nThe professor in question is a very well-dressed woman, always wearing makeup and heels, sometimes wearing skinny pants and the like.  Her clothes are never revealing\u2014I know this because I have paid attention to her clothing every lecture since this encounter.  I tried to defend her, saying that I see nothing inappropriate with how she dresses and that I think she is very professional, which was countered by \u201cshe has a responsibility to not be distracting to her students.\u201d  I replied \u201cyou have a responsibility as a student to not be distracted, your horniness is not her problem.\u201d  \n\nEventually one friend said that we shouldn\u2019t talk about this and we should get back to studying, and I didn\u2019t push it.  I didn\u2019t want to make a scene, and I knew that I was on the cusp of a big angry argument.  I regret that.  Because this is how it made me feel:\n\nA woman can *literally* be intelligent enough to gain a tenured research position in the country\u2019s top university, but if she looks good, *it doesn\u2019t fucking matter*.  Because the thing is, I would probably dress similarly to her, in her place.  I pride myself on feeling good with how I look and choosing a cute wardrobe.  And my friends would see that as a reason to delegitimize my accomplishments.  It doesn\u2019t matter what I or other women to show they are capable.  You don\u2019t even need to show skin.  Being smart is not enough.  Because if you wear skinny jeans, you\u2019re not just a professor.  You\u2019re a slutty professor.  \n\nPlease reassure me that my entire STEM career won\u2019t be like this.\n\nEDIT:  so, the answer to my question is officially yes, it will be like this.  I think a PM I received sums it up pretty well: \u201cyou\u2019ll fail your STEM degree and get your Mrs degree instead\u201d.  To them and some other commenters on here, I\u2019d like to say this, which I replied in another comment: \n\n\nA female researcher must be twice as smart, but if she dresses well, she\u2019s distracting and unprofessional\u2014and not taken as seriously\u2014 and if she dresses ugly, then that is commented on as well.  You can\u2019t get it right.  What happens when your coworkers and boss think this way, that because you wear makeup and like to feel good with your appearance you are somehow unprofessional?  How does that affect future opportunities and workplace dynamics?  Not harmoniously.  These comments are part of the victim-blaming culture, which expects a woman to change herself, even when she is totally appropriate, because some horny men can\u2019t keep it in their pants. There is way too much compassion for men that say and do things that are intolerable.  A healthy society reinforces consequences for intolerable actions.  A society where judging a formidably intelligent woman by her dress is tolerable, has a problem.  So if we want to progress, we politely explain why that is not okay.  And I explain with a smile because I\u2019m compassionate.  Because they\u2019re my friends.  And god knows I\u2019ve had to explain these things hundreds of times.  But you know what?  I shouldn\u2019t have to.  Once is enough, and I do that out of compassion.  But inside, I know that somewhere in my future is a man complaining about me at my workplace because they don\u2019t like how I did my hair, or my heels.  And I really hope that man isn\u2019t my boss.","title":"Two of my male friends said our chemistry professor is unprofessional for \u201cdressing like that\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s distracting\u201d, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/eoip7f\/two_of_my_male_friends_said_our_chemistry\/","upvote_ratio":0.75,"over_18":false}

You need to file now. The last state to enact no fault divorce was in 2010. 2010. If they can overturn Roe v. Wade, which was precedent for 50+ years, they can over turn no fault divorce. And this is one of the key signatures of the 2025 project. File now. Make a plan now. Get out now. Please leave so you\u2019re not stuck having to prove infidelity or abuse. That can be really hard to do, especially with judges who don\u2019t like women. \n\nEdit 1: I\u2019ve seen several folks asking what a \u201cno fault\u201d divorce is. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I\u2019ll roughly explain.\n\nFirst, for those of you not in the US, you have to remember that each state has its own laws regarding marriage. The federal government does not currently define marriage, but under rulings by the US Supreme Court, the federal government can force the states to include some definitions that others don\u2019t for example Loving vs. Virginia (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Loving_v._Virginia), which forced states to allow interracial marriage. More recently, some states had allowed same sex marriage, but Obergefell v. Hodges (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obergefell_v._Hodges) forced all states to allow same sex marriage by saying it was a right for all citizens to marry, even if it was to someone of the same sex. \n\nSo each state has marriage laws. All states now have \u201cno fault\u201d divorce, which means that either person in a marriage can file for divorce against the other person without a reason and the court has to grant it. In past years, many states required that you prove one of three things to be able to divorce - infidelity or violence\/abuse or substance abuse. Many conservative men (including our soon to be VP, JD Vance) want to end no fault divorce, so you could only get out if you prove, in a court of law, that one of those three things is true. Here is a CNN article that explain why requiring someone to be at fault (https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/11\/27\/us\/no-fault-divorce-explained-history-wellness-cec\/index.html) \n\nHere is a quote: \u201cBefore no-fault divorce, a woman in the US who was in an abusive or exploitative marriage didn\u2019t have many options. Husbands typically controlled a family\u2019s finances, and the social stigma for seeking divorce \u2014 not to mention the difficult process of having to prove \u201cfault\u201d \u2014 was a major deterrent. These problems got more complicated if a husband didn\u2019t want a divorce.\u201d\n\nIn the US, 70% of divorces are filed by women (https:\/\/www.whitleylawfirmpc.com\/3-reasons-why-women-initiate-divorce-more-often-than-men\/) and you only have to read through this sub to know why. Conservatives want to stop women from ending this marriages and they have plans to do it. \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve seen a couple comments about my circumstances, specifically. You can go back through my comment history or post history. I\u2019m not married. I was married for about 15 years (with two kids). We separated in 2021 and divorced in 2023. I would have been able to get divorced with a fault divorce because my ex cheated, but I spent $4000 on a lawyer (as did he) because things become somewhat contentious around the splitting of assets and child support. We did not say why we were divorcing in the paperwork. It was a no fault divorce and it still cost me $4000 and we never went to trial (and annoyingly, we came to an agreement outside of our lawyers because his lawyer was delaying things and he wanted to get remarried). So imagine what it would cost a woman trying to escape an abusive marriage from a spouse who does not want them to end the marriage. Women with limited resources would have no means of escape. \n\nAs a side note, I don\u2019t hate men and if you\u2019re happy in your marriage\u2026great. But I\u2019m sending this warning out for women who are unsafe and unhappy to get out now. My ex and I get along well, now. We have 50\/50 custody of our kids, live four blocks from each other, coparent well, celebrate holidays and birthdays together and like each other\u2019s new partners. It is the best case scenario post divorce, but it is exceedingly rare. ","title":"It\u2019s time for divorce.

It was 1am and I had decided to leave the club before all my friends because I was drunk and tired. I waited outside for a while, trying and failing to find a taxi. A man was standing at the entrance smoking, observing my struggle. After a while he comes up to me, strikes up a conversation \u2013 he\u2019s my age, clean-cut, very polite and friendly. We chat for a while, and then he mentions he lives in my neighborhood and he\u2019d be happy to give me a ride. Stupidly, I agree.\n\nShortly after getting in the car with him, he reaches for my hand and starts holding it. Afraid of angering this strange man I suddenly realize was a bad idea to accept a ride from, I let him. He unzips his fly and puts my hand on his dick. Still scared, I let him. He starts jerking himself off with my hand. He pulls over and comes over to the passenger side of the seat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease just let me out of the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you want this,\u201d he said. He\u2019s now standing on top of me, unzipping his fly.\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me go.\u201d\n\nHe starts kissing me. I pull away. He\u2019s trying to spread my legs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this!\u201d I say louder.\n\n\u201cShut up, you want to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. This is rape. You are about to rape me. You are a rapist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a rapist.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes you are. You are raping me right now. This is rape.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not rape! You want this!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re raping me right now. Rapist! Rapist! Rapist!\u201d I start shouting hysterically.\n\n\"Stop saying that!\" he shouts. \"Wallah, I'm a good Muslim man, I would never rape a woman.\"\n\nFinally he pulls away. I jump out of the car and start walking away rapidly. He drives off. I\u2019m now in the middle of nowhere, phone is dead, no taxi in sight, but hey, at least I haven\u2019t been raped. It takes me several hours to find my way home, crying the whole time.\n\nI\u2019ve always found this story kind of interesting because of what it says about how certain men perceive non-consensual sexual experiences. I\u2019m sure if I hadn\u2019t said what I said, the next day he\u2019d be bragging to everyone he got laid and the woman loved it, she was begging for me. I think men, especially when drunk, can get blinded by lust; they want it so bad and they don\u2019t understand how we could not want it. Actually telling them that what they are doing is rape can maybe wake them up to the severity of the act they are about to commit \u2013 not in all cases, of course. But maybe sometimes.\n\nJust wanted to share in case this ever helps someone get out of a similar situation.\n\n*Edit:* I'm not able to respond to all your messages, but I want to say I really appreciate the outpouring of support, and the experiences everyone has shared. It seems this is a sickeningly common situation, and I'm sorry for the pain and fear so many of you have gone through.\n\nQuite a few women have shared stories where they used this exact tactic and it worked, so I really think we should add this to our arsenal of protective strategies against sexual assault. Sad that we live in a world where this is necessary.\n\nTo the people telling me it was my fault for getting in the car with a strange man - I know that was an incredibly stupid thing to do and am not justifying it, but that doesn't mean I deserved to be raped. \n\nHave also received several dms saying that I jerked him off, I was a tease and I wanted it. Did you miss the part where he took my hand and moved it for me? Even if I had done that of my own volition, the moment I withdraw my consent it becomes rape.\n\nFinally, to all the men spamming my dms with nasty messages because you're too cowardly to air your disgusting misogyny in public: don't bother, I won't respond.","title":"A strange tactic I used to stave off an attempted rape","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TwoXChromosomes\/comments\/ktjd6n\/a_strange_tactic_i_used_to_stave_off_an_attempted\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false}
