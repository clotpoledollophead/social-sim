So I have spent the past 8 years wearing sunscreen every two hours, eating 100% clean food (not even birthday cake), drinking minimally, and going to bed on time. I also began anti-aging skin products at 25. Like I was American Psycho-level about it, drinking collagen and refusing to go outside without my sun umbrella.\n\nI'll turn 27 on May 29th, and I looked at myself in the mirror. I look literally the exact same as I did at 19. I have pictures, and there's no difference, except that I have more abs. The only difference is that I have two lines under each eye, and they are very small. I'm a graduate student, and everyone thinks that I'm 20 and is surprised to hear my true age.\n\nMany of my friends, both male and female, have aged horribly.

The man standing behind me in line began to engage with me in small talk, as well as a few people around us. He asked me where I was heading, and I told him I had an interview for a nursing program. He said he was traveling for work, and I asked him what he did for a living. He sort of looked down at his feet, and told me, \"I don't know, it's pretty boring. You probably wouldn't want to hear about it.\"  I laughed and said I'm sure that's not true. He explained that he worked for a company that was developing electrical devices that would be sealed into the concrete of skyscrapers that could remotely report the structural integrity of the building during earthquakes, hurricanes, etc. \"Just an office job.\" I told him I actually really thought his work was very interesting and very cool, and that I was sure it would save a lot of people's lives. His eyes sort of lit up, he straightened up, stared at me, and told me he'd never really thought about it that way before. We got on the plane, I made my way to my seat, he ended up about ten rows in front of me, and a few minutes after sitting down, he stood up and passed his business card through ten rows of people, and gave me a wave.\n\nI wasn't single, and probably wouldn't have been interested even if I had been. I was just trying to be kind and courteous to a stranger in line. But although he never heard from me, I really do hope he was able to keep that light in his eyes and confidence that I saw develop in those few fleeting moments.\n\n**The Lesson:** It's the oldest archetype known to man. The Hero. The dragon-slaying princess-saving man of admiration and honor. The man little boys dream of becoming. In 2018, that little boy grows up to be told by women everywhere that his masculinity is toxic, that his strength is oppressive, that his accomplishments are the result of privilege, that his efforts are futile, that his nature is predatory, that fatherhood is meaningless, that husbands are useless...\n\n...that he won't be able to find his way without pulling over and asking for directions.\n\nIn five minutes, a few words of encouragement, genuine interest, and admiration from a stranger completely changed this man's attitude about his work. It's quite possible that for the first time since he was a young boy, he felt like he could be a hero. A woman made him feel better about himself, instead of tearing him down. Imagine the impact you could have on a man in a lifetime. I take it back - the oldest archetype isn't the hero. It's the Woman. The Woman Worth Fighting For. The Woman that civilized man, the Beauty to the Beast. Feminism has decided that it's not fair that the hero archetype belongs to men - we want to be heroes too, right? But when you compete with a man instead of supporting him and loving him, you take away his pride and motivation, and become an adversary instead of his princess and number one fan.\n\nYes, ladies, we have a masculinity crisis in this country. But who's responsible, and what will it take to reverse the damage done? Whether you're entering the dating market, or have been married for 30+ years, take a second to remind yourself to look up at a man, instead of looking down on him. See the hero in them they desperately want to be, even if he does just work an office job. Be a woman who inspires him. Admire his efforts, thank him for his sacrifices, let him be your hero. And as he begins to see himself through your eyes, *magic happens*. I've even seen this happen over the course of the past several months with my own man, and can't wait to see where he'll go from here.\n\nI hope you all are having a beautiful Tuesday.","title":"What I learned about male psychology in line at the airport","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/95fizz\/what_i_learned_about_male_psychology_in_line_at\/"}

This is because your brain is trying to avoid cognitive dissonance (confusion) by finding reasons for why your posture is so dominant. \"Maybe it's because I'm a confident person,\" your brain thinks. There are studies that show that if you want an acquaintance to like you, you should ask them to do a favor for you, and not the other way around (you doing a favor for them). Their brain will try to avoid confusion by finding a reason for why they did a favor for you. \"I must like that person,\" their brain thinks.\n\n\nI think a great deal of this can be extended to love, and I've felt it extend to love.\n\n\nSome of you probably heard that story of a husband who wanted a divorce. His wife agrees but on the condition that he carries her into bed every day for a month. After the month, he finds that he fell in love again. Whether it's a true story or not, it resonates with a lot of people because it captures some truth about how emotions work.\n\n\n**We don't have to be slaves to our emotions. We can gradually change and direct our emotions through conscious action. Our brains will find an emotional \"excuse\" for why we're performing certain actions.**\n\n\nMy own example: I've been with my partner for almost two years and love him as much as ever. But recently, I had some stresses with work and I mostly neglected cooking and noticed we didn't have sex for 3 or 4 days. This was just a week or two but around that time, I noticed that my feelings were waning ever so slightly. I was slightly annoyed at him for no reason, since he was behaving the same as usual. But, I was behaving differently. Fortunately, I knew what was going on so I consciously decided to take some time to make a nice meal and get myself in the mood to be really submissive and giving during sex. After that night - really as the night was progressing - I felt my emotions come back with a vengeance. It almost felt like I had I crush on him! I was giddy and excited.\n\n\nSo it's slightly sad that when the wife is unhappy in a marriage, she seems to look first at her husband. What is he not doing for me? Can't he be better? Sometimes a conversation is had and the husband makes a bunch of improvements which tragically only makes him love her more. Her feelings remain unchanged. Her feelings probably changed in the first place because she was putting in less effort than before. Feeling slightly disrespectful, then behaving disrespectfully, then feeling more disrespectful can spiral out of control. The solution is for the wife to consciously act in a respectful and loving manner, and be patient for her emotions to come around.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, if the husband is abusive or something, obviously don't do this. This post is specifically for the common case of \"my husband is such a great guy, I don't know why I'm so bored!\" And of course this theory doesn't only apply to women. If a husband starts losing interest in his wife, it may just be because somewhere along the way, he got comfortable and stopped putting in the work to please her. This is why some relationship books suggest that the wife always share her hopes with her husband, so he can have a chance to fulfill them.\n\nEdit: Whoa I got a star! That's so incredibly encouraging!

But already the gender differences are coming out. I was on the phone with him today, and he was telling me about his quails.\n\nHe has 4 quails, and something terrible happened a month ago. He left open the door of the quail cage and some of the more intrepid quail wandered outside, where they were quickly picked apart by crows. Nothing was left but feathery tufts and scattered viscera, and 4 of the quieter quails remained huddled, terrified, in the cage.\n\nSo he said now he guards the quails. \"I take them outside for more than 15 minutes to play on the grass, and I stay guard over them. And it feels so good to guard them from crows because they are cute and fluffy!\"\n\nHis protective instincts have kicked in for something smaller and cuter than he is, and he revels in his duty as Protector of the Small. This instinct will never leave him, he will always want to protect things smaller and cuter than he is (like women). For now, though, he is still 8, and is small himself, so quail are the only outlet.\n\nTakeaways to trigger men's protective instincts:\n\n- be small\n- be cute\n- stay close when there are crows around\n\nMy brother didn't see the quails as an imposition, or a burden, or weak. He just saw them as something that added joy to his life. He recognised that if he wanted the quails to continue to add joy to his life, he must guard them from crows, and he was happy and proud to do so.\n\nI used to get a little annoyed when I got called cute by men, but I now realise it had nothing to do with me being inept or weak. It had to do with them recognising instinctively that in a tough situation, they'd have to be the ones to act, because they're faster, stronger and bigger. And their instincts are screaming at them to protect me, because I bring joy to their life, and the worst case scenario is feathery tufts\u00a0(or human female equivalent) and\u00a0viscera. The way it is consciously expressed, though, is \"you are cute\".\n\n(Incidentally, this is why men hate being called cute.)\n\nWhich got me thinking: a woman that acts in a manner that implies she is receiving protective benefits from her man will in turn, make him feel useful and proud, and reinforce her cuteness to him, all subconsciously.\n\nSuch as;\n\n- keeping physically close to him in unfamiliar surroundings\n- not wandering off by yourself (I have given some of my male friends quite a scare by doing this!)\n- relying on him for transport and shelter (as much as practicable)\n- taking his advice for personal safety (sigh... this one's tough, because I like doing risky things)\n\nIf you don't do the above, he will constantly feel like you don't appreciate his protectiveness. Be appreciative instead and let him be proud of protecting you.","title":"Learning about the male protective instinct from my brother","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/lzo0e1\/learning_about_the_male_protective_instinct_from\/"}

Seeing as they are just friends to me as a straight women. As long as they are happy, I'm happy. And I think they should be respected. I also understand why straight men don't find their bodies attractive. I saw a photo of a famous obese model and thought her face is gorgeous, it's a shame that there's so many men that would turn her down simply because of her body. And then it occurred to me, that means that even if a women doesn't have a model face, if she's fit she's more likely to turn heads no matter how much makeup that model wears, what perfume, how kind she is, how rich she is. And as a very average looking woman who is trying to get fit and look great in a bikini, this was really encouraging. I think I saw a statistic that soon almost half of US population will be overweight to obese. And that more women than men are obese.

I'm a nurse, and the transition was stressful, and the shifts were long and the mornings were dark, early, damp, and cold. There was a woman who would ride the same bus at the same time as me, and although we never exchanged a word, she has made a lasting impact on me, and I find myself thinking of her often. I wanted to share my experience with you ladies. \n\nThis woman was an average woman, likely in her 50s, with a rather plain face, plain clothes, and sometimes rather disheveled. She often sat across from me, with muddy rain boots, and hair slightly askew from wind and rain. Every other person on the bus was either sleeping, or on their phone, scowling, irritable, and cold. \n\nBut this woman wore a smile. Her expression was always soft, inviting, friendly, and she had a peaceful presence about her that was mesmerizing and downright fascinating. She was beautiful, warm, and kind. She never looked impatient, she never scowled down at a phone screen, she would not look away when I met her gaze but would smile sweetly at me, and I would smile back. We shared these rides together in silence, and I found myself smiling too. I would look out the window as the first traces of light came up through the treetops, and I would find stillness in an otherwise stressful commute. \n\nThen, as weeks passed, I noticed a shift in my own behavior. I noticed myself smiling at work, among coworkers who were stressed, anxious, and exhausted. I noticed that I could make the people around me laugh, and smile too, and maybe even complain less. My patients seemed to smile more as well,  despite their suffering and fear. I noticed that I would catch myself smiling while standing in line at the grocery store, or while doing the dishes, or weeding. I would smile in the car, when going on rides with my partner.\n\nAnd as the world has changed through this pandemic, as people have begun social distancing, and fearing not only the virus but one another, smiles have seemed to disappear altogether, mask or no mask. \n\nWhether you cover your face or not, smile more.

Most posts asking \u2018What do RPW actually stand for?\u2019 were answered with \u2018Being abused. Plate school. Internalized misogyny. Sucking TRP mod cyber-dick.\u2019 With few exceptions, these were answered by PPD-ers whose opinion was formed out of their own little circlejerk rather than actually participating here.\n\nSo even though I'm posting in RPW where I'm already preaching to the choir, and this won't be new knowledge to anyone here, I\u2019m going to throw in my two cents, because I think I owe this place more than to sit by and let it be maligned.\n\nI came to RPW because the blue-pill message I had received from the dominant culture had failed me. \n\n* \u201cThe right man will just fall into your lap when it\u2019s time. Don\u2019t worry about dating to try to increase your odds, you precious Woman. You never have to do anything that puts you outside of your comfort zone.\u201d\n* \u201cThe right man will love you unconditionally exactly as you are, and if you\u2019re fat and mean, well-- he\u2019s just not Man Enough to handle you.\u201d\n* \u201cA woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle. There is no value in male leadership. If you let a man lead, you're being abused. Watch out, all men are just trying to fuck you over.\u201d\n* \u201cWeight doesn\u2019t matter. BMI is a lie. All sizes are sexy and healthy!\u201d\n* \u201cMen are most impressed by Spunky Women who are smart enough to verbally spar with them, and win by attrition, every hour of every day. So don\u2019t worry about being positive, receptive, easygoing, or sweet. Be critical and competitive with men to show them you\u2019re Just So Smart.\u201d\n* \u201cHaving kids can always wait. Never prioritize family over career. You can just postpone these decisions indefinitely. Did you see that article about that woman who had a kid at 50?\u201d\n\nGiven how often I heard these mantras-- and from the abundance of sources, from my Smith-educated pals to Buzzfeed to TV shows-- I figured, \u2018They must be right.\u2019 And even I was complicit in my own deception. I repeated these lies to myself when I felt a pang of anxiety. These lies were a great security blanket, because most of them required very little action from me. I could stay chunky and sad! I could avoid having to put myself out there and date in the dangerous world! I could stick my fingers in my ears and avoid the nagging sense that I was falling behind, that I\u2019d really like a husband.\n\nUltimately, I had to take the much-maligned, oft-misunderstood Women\u2019s Red Pill. \n\nRPW helped me fix my body issues and my brief stint in what I can now recognize as depression. RPW helped me date rationally, intentionally, without anxiety, and without feeling undue pressure to put out and act unlike myself. \n\nSince I knew what men ACTUALLY wanted-- a sweet, healthy partner who is receptive to their strengths as men-- I was freed from the pressure to act cool and aloof, constantly be on the defensive, and chase men. Since I knew how to vet for a wonderful man, I was freed from petty insecurities, from the fear that he was just looking for a quick nut, that he\u2019d just string me along. I knew how to recognize men like that and what to do to protect myself. \n\nLiving out the ideas on RPW helped me find a wonderful husband, a better job, a healthier body, and a healthier mind.\n\nAnd I\u2019m still here, because I\u2019m starting to see that it\u2019s part of a broader picture. Even though sometimes we gotta roast the guys who post here for giving bad advice, I believe that the RPW readership (and the men who comment productively here) are the only group of people in the Pill-o-sphere that are focused on harmony between the sexes-- not just sexually, but in terms of our society.\n\nI think the deepest BP lie, being propagated consciously or unconsciously right now, is that Men Are Bad. Men are cruel, men are power-mad, men hate women, men want to subjugate women. Yes, there are some men who are like this, just like there are women with equally evil qualities. \n\nI think that the fundamental RPW truth-- the reason I read here even though I\u2019m past needing to learn the SMP basics-- is that men are good. The sexes evolved to complement one another, not to scrabble in a power-struggle for eternity. I believe men are not emotionally stunted failed women-- they are stoic because they can\u2019t afford to freak out and cry when the tigers come to eat our babies. I believe they aren\u2019t sex-crazed monsters-- they are biologically wired to want sex just like any other type of biological wiring. I believe they are not evil chauvinists upholding the patriarchy by keeping women down-- they are leaders and protectors. \n\nThanks for reading this far lol.","title":"\"What even is Red Pill Women lolol?? pLaTe sChOoL???1?\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/hrq6bu\/what_even_is_red_pill_women_lolol_plate_school1\/"}

There's no obligation involved because it's different to do something out of obligation instead of love.\n\nMen support our society and get no gratitude for it. Good men are everywhere! We should make it a priority to talk about *what we want or value* in men instead of only pointing out bad behavior. The bad apples get enough attention, let's stop that.\n\nI had two things happen to me. I was at the clinic and a man scooted aside and told me that I could sit on the bench next to him, I stand because I know it's polite and didn't want to disturb him. Instead of scoffing at his manspreading I was quietly being polite and waited for him to go first to his appointment, but he didn't. He let me sit, then let me go ahead of him when I was called. I thanked him and that made him smile a little.\n\nLater, I was at a health store couldn't afford the tea I needed for my sore throat and the male cashier stopped me and took money out of his own pocket to pay for it! I was so touched. It was only 75 cents but I don't make a lot and neither does he so I felt cared for in a very fatherly way. I thanked him and that left a smile on my face.\n\nThe last example is not me personally but it speaks volumes. It was in an account of a survivor of 9\/11. Her male colleague stepped in front of her to shield her with his body when the first tower collapsed (they were in the WTC and didn't know the second plane would hit). I really felt how beautiful it is that man is willing to sacrifice himself for a woman.\n\nGuys, men are good. I have my share of bad experiences but men and women can act in very cruel ways. I've been groped, I've been harassed and verbally abused but it's not men, just human nature. As women we have the responsibility of being the fairer sex and being kind no matter what, instead of resentful and cruel and demanding and harpies. Men aren't obligated to do anything for us. They do it out of the big bear love in their hearts and I just think we should acknowledge that more often. The more you notice good in your world the more it tends to happen to you!\n\nWhat do you think ladies?","title":"Men Are Kind","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/oku8g9\/men_are_kind\/"}

What makes them feel the pressure? What makes them all of a sudden to feel like they are going to spend the rest of their life alone?\n\nSociety now has us believe that we should explore as many options as possible in our twenties (which is not necessarily a bad thing) before settling on one in some few years down the line but the truth is as the years go on, the options keep trickling down. \n\nImagine this scenario, there is a meeting about to begin in a hall, people are settling down as they wait for the speaker to begin his speech. Most people will naturally pick the best spots to sit in and with people they are comfortable with. Now imagine you come in late, and find that the speaker is already giving his speech and it's silence all across the hall, you see a chair in the middle that is free and you want to sit there but there are also chairs near you. As you try to access the chair you want, people start staring at you and you feel uncomfortable and you finally decide to sit in the chair closest to you. \n\nI feel like that's what happens to most people in their thirties, they get a sudden realization that most of their friends and people around them are engaged or married and that they didn't commit to any relationship or were involved in many meaningless relationship. To make matters worse, external pressure kicks in, so it's not about finding a suitable partner for you anymore but trying to fit in and be like the rest. \n\nIt's why I believe one should take the relationship in their twenties seriously, vet the people coming to your life and ask yourself the question, is this a man or woman I would like to have children with, is this a person I can create a meaningful relationship with that can lead to marriage, is the person working towards a future that can be relied upon. If the answer is no, do not proceed, remember in your twenties there is no pressure, it's why it is a good time to find a good companion for yourself. \n\nChances of settling become higher the more you get older. \n\nThis also cuts across all types of relationships, the more you grow the harder it becomes to create new friends so also make a point to associate yourself with ambitious people in your twenties. \n\nThe fear of missing out is not real!!!What are you really missing out? Sex? I find it more appealing to do and create good memories with a few individuals who are guaranteed to be by your side than with a multitude of people who will leave you at the end of the day as you cry by yourself to sleep all alone. You get to choose the memories and life you create with the right people by your side.","title":"Do not fall for the lie of having fun now and settling later while you in your twenties or be involved in meaningless relationships.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/evncgl\/do_not_fall_for_the_lie_of_having_fun_now_and\/"}

I work in a male-dominated industry and hear a lot of conversations about things that my coworkers say about their wives and girlfriends. A LOT of it are all things we discuss regularly, but I thought I'd make a list to share what I've heard directly from the horse's mouth:  \n\n\n1. **They do not want the weight of your debt to fall on their shoulders.** This includes student loans. If you took out a lot of debt, even if it was in order to better yourself, don't expect that your man will be happy if you suddenly want to stay at home. After all, you took out those debts because you were planning on being able to pay them yourself. \n2. **A clean house, means a happy spouse.** Some of my coworkers do have wives that work less or not at all, and yet comment that the first thing they have to do when they get home is dishes, vacuuming, laundry, etc. Not a single one of them expects the house to be perfect at all times, but they can't understand why they have to pick-up the second they get home when their wife was home all day.\n3. **Food is the way to their hearts**. Two of our older managers have wives that pack their lunches every day, not once have they ever had anything negative to say about their wives. In fact they often speak very fondly of their wives, and clearly cherish them very dearly. The rest of my male counterparts do not show this much affection publicly, while they might not say anything negative about their wives they don't say anything positive either.\n4. **When you're stressed, they're stressed.** They work long hours and when they come home and you're not happy, they feel that negativity tenfold. Some of my coworkers have given up on trying to solve the endless stresses at home, and stay at work long past having anything to actually work on because they dread returning home.\n5. **They like displays of affection.** Cute text messages, love note snuck into their coat pockets, a container of brownies to take to work, surprising them with lunch, etc. It is amazing how much little things can brighten a man's week.\n6. **Men like to have the opportunity to wow you**. Many of my male coworkers compete with each other to see who can give their wives the most romantic surprises, they want to be the ones to initiate dates and surprises.\n7. **They want to be relied on, but that doesn't mean carrying dead weight.** Men are fixers, when there's a problem they want to fix it. This is part of why endless stresses and complaining at home is so hard on them, because it demonstrates not that you're relying on them but that instead you've become a ball and chain that contributes nothing and can't be solved. \n8. **Men like having their ego stroked.** Compliment them when they act, even if it's for little things. My male coworkers hold being handy and considered capable in very high regard at work and at home. They want you to think they're good at what they do and to admire their hard work.  \n\n\nThese are the most common things that they discuss, and they all boil down to exactly what RPW teaches. None of them expect their SOs to be perfect but what would you rather be: the SO who is spoken about like the best prize your man has ever won or the SO he has nothing to say about? So keep him fed, the house clean, and affirm him with appreciation, and he'll be ten times happier!","title":"Things your SO cares about that he probably isn't telling you.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/amllqv\/things_your_so_cares_about_that_he_probably_isnt\/"}

I\u2019ve taken a hiatus from writing - mostly to continue on with my life - but to also grow as a lady, to grow as a woman. What does it mean to be a mature woman in the modern age, where youth seems to be a security blanket that haunts us as we get older? How can we be both mature, responsible, and fun? We talk about being that hot, bubbly, fun girl, but is she also wife material? How can we safely and productively combine the adult qualities with the energetic innocence that keeps us excited about life?\n\nGTFU. Not GTFO, not STFU. GTFU. Grow The F*** Up.\n\n**[1] Discover your personality outside of your career.** Our careers are not our personalities, they are simply either (depending on you) a money-making role, or a status-role that labels you as a contributing member of society. But regardless of your monetary assets or your job title, who are you? What makes you excited about life? If you didn\u2019t have your job, what kind of books or activities would you partake in? That is your personality, and that is the part of you that our men like to know.\n\n**[2] Learn how to nurture others.** Men seek a wife who can also be a counselor and lend a listening ear. Learn to sympathize, and don\u2019t fuck it up by bringing the conversation back to yourself again. This is a true test of your consideration towards your man. Can you listen to him, sympathize with him, and when he needs it, advise him? The maternal nurturance of affection (physical and emotional affection) is the maturity that men crave in a partner. It is the \u201cAgnes\u201d quality (in *David Copperfield*), it is the blessed, emotional matriarchal quality that men so insanely desire in addition to the physical beauty of women. A man cannot fully dedicate himself to you unless you are able to show him sympathy and wisdom.\n\n**[3] Read and expand your vocabulary to develop your self-expression.** A mature woman requires strong communication skills: she has eloquence, she is articulate, she possesses social grace. Practice writing, practice small-talk, practice the discussion of topics (especially ones that you are passionate about!) Don\u2019t be one of those women who brings her rants and complaints everywhere. Practice talking about topics and ideas, rather than the petty negative elements of daily life.\n\n**[4] Find your sass!** As women, we have something called our *animus* (or our masculine qualities, in which every single woman has, in order to become wholly functioning). Women can be adventurous, mischievous, spirited (because who wants to be boring?) - and this kind of fire can energize your partner and within your own life. Find that inner imp inside of you. That is the life-force in you: your wit, your character, your enthusiasm, your morale. Infuse your actions with your warmth and vigor. Your man will appreciate it. Don\u2019t be a doormat; no, I\u2019m sorry: REFUSE to be a doormat. Instead, be FUN.\n\n**[5] Abolish your negativity.** We don\u2019t need a thesis to know that men don\u2019t like to be around negative women (actually, nobody likes to be around a downer, period!) This skill requires gradual and long-term growth, as being kind and optimistic is a *practice of values* that occurs over time. If you struggle with negative rumination, then meditate, get psychotherapy, practice self-care, journal, *whatever it is you need to do* to stop being obsessed with negativity...bottom line: eradicate that nastiness!\n\n**[6] Develop a quiet, inner strength.** You are a full-fledged adult woman. Women can be beautiful and strong, soft and strong, feminine and strong, graceful and strong, loving and strong. To be feminine is not to be *weak*, it merely is an indicator of either your physical image or the methodology of how you approach things (Do you approach with empathy or rigidity? Do you approach with fun and flair or with harsh aggression? Do you approach with laughter or anger? Do you approach by sitting still or by hunting?)\n\nNow get out there, ladies, and be the best, beautifully vivacious woman you can be.","title":"GTFU.

How you handle this small window of time can have an enormous impact on your relationship. But it is often mishandled, making men feel drained and taken for granted. \n\nWhen we are waiting for our partners, our instinct is often to treat them as we would like to be treated. We make them the center of attention as soon as they walk in. In return, some men retreat or even get angry! \"I just need a few minutes.\" \"Can't I have five minutes to myself?\" Whaaaat's going on? Why doesn't he appreciate coming home to a loving partner?!\n\nThe reason for this is simple: he needs to decompress. He needs to switch from \"work mode\" to \"home mode\". In order to do this, he needs to be able to stop thinking about work. \n\nWe often think about several things at the same time.  However, most men prefer to work through one idea at a time. When he comes home from work, he may not be done thinking about all his \"work thoughts\". Until he sees those thoughts through to a logical conclusion or ending-point, they will nag at him. It's like trying to read a website with a big, neon popup flashing in the corner. He won't be able to be fully present, and he will find your bid for attention to be tiring rather than flattering. \n\nInstead of overwhelming him, allow him to come to you. Greet him warmly, then busy yourself with something while he decompresses. I find making my partner a warm drink and then reading is a great thing to busy myself with. Each man is different in his decompression activity and how long it takes - if you don't know what your partner's is, try to figure it out. My fiance likes to read the news on his phone. Maybe yours likes to go to the garage to tinker, or play with the dog. \n\nWhen he's decompressed, he'll approach you warmly. Only then should you initiate the \"after work conversation\" about how his day was. \n\nDuring this conversation, he may tumble out any last 'work thoughts' he can't resolve easily. Your job here is not to try to solve them (unless he explicitly asks for advice) but provide two gifts he cherishes. Fist, validate his concerns. Then, offer a small piece of admiration. Is he tired of the long hours needed to meet a deadline? Acknowledge that it must be exhausting and thank him for working so hard for your family. Or maybe he has an annoying coworker; it must be hard to get anything done with someone like that around but you're impressed by how well he handles that shit-slinging baboon of an accountant. This show of support is often the last thing he needs to get into \"home mode\". It flips the switch.   \n\n\nHe's in his haven now.\n\nSO... What's your partner's after-work decompression ritual?

Hilarious, witty, and easily a natural at engaging with women despite being very much an introvert. \n\n He would have plenty of options if he was single, especially now that he is respected in his field and making over six figures. However, it was not always like that.\n\nThe relationship was rocky while we were broke and in college as I had not dealt with some emotional instability and dramatic tendencies on my end (insecurity at its finest). He knew he could date around and was not ready to commit.\n\nWhat solidified the relationship for him was after he was laid off from his first out of college job. It was a huge blow to his mental health and purpose.\n\nHe admits to me now he would have spiraled out of control if it wasn't for my patience and support in that time. I learned fast that he needed me in his corner more than ever, and my own neediness and attention seeking behavior had to be dealt with immediately or the relationship was over. So I put a stop to the nonsense and learned to be lower maintenance. \n\nFast forward to today. We have been living together happily for two years.\n\nI encouraged him to go out and have some \"him\" time the other day. He called me on his way home to say that he appreciates me so much and that he hopes he doesn't ever take me for granted. What prompted this?\n\nHe ended up going to a local pub for a couple beers and struck up a conversation with a woman around our age ( 30-31). The woman was apparently very attractive, very into him, and asked for his contact info. As they talked he said he started to feel sick. \n\nHe said she gave off negative feminine energy, or tells in her conversation that she was high maintenance and \"testing\" him for specific reactions (\"The bullshit that girls do\" in his words). He said he forgot that other women can be like that because I am low maintenance and so easy to be around. He never has to \"deal with\" me. He then asked me \"I want to treat you.  Is there anything I can get you?\" then offered to pay for an expensive electronic item I've had my eye on for a while. \n\nI've started thinking about high maintenance and low maintenance behavior. Men talk negatively about high maintenance women and to avoid the trappings of a woman like that. But what does that mean?\n\n I've compromised a list of my experiences and examples about high maintenance behavior and what constitutes low maintenance behavior:\n\nHigh Maintenance\n\n-Covertly demanding resources  (\"So Rebecca told me that HER boyfriend is planning on taking them on a road trip. He SHOULD do those things with her, they've been together for a year!\") \n\n-Snide comments about men (\"Yeah that figures... typical men.\")\n\n-Petty gossiping (\"I know Samantha is my friend, but she's still single for a reason ...\" *goes into unprompted, lengthy story*)\n\n-Disrespectful of his time (\"Can we stop in Sephora while we're out? That limited edition palette I talked to you about was released and I want to test out some swatches.\")\n\n-Dismissive of his interests (\"You collect Pokemon cards? Isn't that stuff for kids?\")\n\n-Lack of gratitude (\"What do you expect? A round of applause every time you take out the trash?\" )\n\n-Boastful and aggressive (\"You should have known that I ALWAYS win when we play trivia.\")\n\n-Creates drama (\"Didn't you notice how Jake's friend was hitting on me? You should have said something to him.\")\n\nLow Maintenance\n\n-States preferences clearly without demanding (\"I have always thought it would be cool to visit X place.\")\n\n-Positive about men as a whole (\"Look at those dudes working in the cold! Props to them, that looks rough.\")\n\n-Mindful of oversharing (\"Samantha is going through a hard time right now. I was thinking of inviting her over.\")\n\n-Respectful of his time (\"I'll run over to Sephora later after we get home. There's something I want to check out there.\")\n\n-Encouraging of his interests (\"You collect Pokemon cards? What are some of your rarest cards?\")\n\n-Expresses gratiude (\"Thanks for taking out the trash! I didn't notice it was full.\")\n\n-Humble and peaceful (\"I always have so much fun with you when we do trivia night!\")\n\n-Difuses drama (\"I'm glad we left when we did. Jake's friend was making me feel uncomfortable.\")\n\nBeing high maintenance I think stems from insecurity or a jaded distrust of men while simultaneously expecting a worthwhile man to commit and give 100% with little sacrifice in return.\n\nI've learned that being low maintenance does not mean giving up your preferences and needs or letting a man walk all over you. It means being aware of realistic relationship dynamics between men and women. It means being emotionally mature enough to be mindful of how you are being perceived and flexible enough to be content with what is in front of you, not manipulating a specific outcome into existence and treating men as an accessory to that outcome. It means being satisfied with the boring reality of the everyday, not looking for the next dopamine hit and relying on men to keep you entertained (More dates! More vacations!)\n\nBeing low maintenance has kept my relationship alive and thriving with a great man who absolutely dotes on me, I'm pretty sure.","title":"High Maintenance vs. Low Maintenance Energy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/rlomaf\/high_maintenance_vs_low_maintenance_energy\/"}

Never take him for granted. Treat him like God's gift to you. \n\n> There will be times when you will be frustrated with him, there will be times when you quarrel. There will be times when you will feel drained or when practically speaking, you must attend to the baby. Nevertheless, even during these times, you should do at least one thing every day that tells him loud and clear: **you are always my number one in the whole wide world!**\n\nAt the time, my head was filled with other ideas. Ideas of female empowerment and equality. I was convinced that I would enter into a marriage of equal partnership between equal partners. \n\nI was respectful of her because I love and respect this woman, with all my heart. But my facial expression must have given away my disagreement. She continued:\n\n> You don't agree with me now. That's okay. One day you will learn. I hope you learn the easy way and not the hard way. \n\nI got married and everything was going well for the first year or so. After all, what's to go wrong during this time? We were both young and healthy and our needs were minimal. We were madly in love and we had sex very often. \n\nBut then, over time, life started to get in the way. The marriage wasn't so new and that special excitement wore off. We started to argue a bit more than we had previously. \n\nThen there were some health challenges, pregnancies, births, babies, toddlers... Obligations and exhaustion dialed up to 11. I'm ashamed to say, that for many months, I almost completely neglected my husband. Even worse, I was short and demanding. I nagged him to hell and criticized his every move. I became a real bitch.\n\nIn my head, I felt justified. After all, he's a grown man and the babies are helpless little humans. I was in full mommy mode and I deserved -**DESERVED** - the world from him for nothing in return. \n\nThis went on for a while until I was over at my grandmother's once again. She asked me how it was going and I was about to start saying that everything was fine when she held my arm to stop me. She said:\n\n> Honey, you can't fool me. I know it isn't going well. You can speak to me if you'd like. You don't have to.\n\nI burst out in tears. So many emotions all at once. She kept handing me tissues as she held my shoulder and arm. I realized that she had been right all along. I wanted to change but I was afraid and terribly embarrassed. \n\nOver time, she taught me how to rebuild my marriage and regain the trust of my wonderful husband. Maybe another day, I'll write down some more of her wisdom.\n\nWhat I'd like to conclude with today is the lesson that is in the title: to always treat your husband as your number one. Always always always. No matter what. \n\nHe needs to know that he is your number one. Your children need to know that he comes before they do. It's good for them to not be the center of the universe. It's good for them to see how you treat your husband like God's gift to you. It's good for your marriage too, obviously. \n\nYes, sometimes, you need to change a diaper or calm a crying baby, before anything else. But even during these times, try to **do** at least one thing every day, that tells him loud and clear: **you are my man and you are my world!**","title":"Your husband is your number one.

Because the goal of this sub was to have happy, healthy, and fulfilling relationships with men (which to us means male-led relationships), its founders recognized that feminism is very often at odds with that goal, as well as many other life goals that the women here tend to have regarding family, friendships, network, career, and more.\n\nIn the early days of RPW, there was a much more unified anti-feminist stance amongst the majority of the community. This not only allowed for more open discussions about why the feminism movement\u2019s effects on modern society have disadvantaged women in various ways, but also let the women here know that it is *okay* to have doubts about the social conditioning that we are given as Western modern women. It was a red pill in and of itself, because it unplugged the women of this community from that social conditioning and gave them the freedom to form their own opinions and values that benefitted *them*, no matter how controversial and at odds with the rest of modern society.\n\nFast forward to today, and we have noticed that we are moving away from the origins of RPW and its intent on being an anti-feminist community. One of our maxims that our mods often repeat is that women from all walks of life are welcome here, whether you\u2019re a chaste Christian girl raised to be traditional and conservative, or a full-time BDSM submissive in a kinky relationship with her life partner. We have no intent on changing this policy, and feminists are certainly allowed to read, participate, and engage here as much as anybody else. However, we\u2019ve noticed a trend\/behavior from our feminist users that goes against the core beliefs of our sub.\n\nWhenever we get posts or comments from women recognizing the fact that they don\u2019t agree or align with modern feminism, we inevitably get multiple feminist RPWs who chime in to defend \u201ctrue feminism\u201d. What results is that the anti-feminist women here in the anti-feminist community made for them have to defend their own beliefs against the same attacks that this community was meant to be a safe haven for. Their own personal and lived experiences with bad feminists are invalidated because the feminist participants here often insist that the idealistic version of feminism is not like that, not recognizing that that version is rarely what exists in practice.\n\nThis community has been and will always be anti-feminist. We allow feminists to participate here because we truly believe that ANY woman who wants to can gain something from this sub. To our feminist participants, please extend the same graciousness to the anti-feminist women here who this sub was explicitly made for. The women who are not feminists do not need to be questioned or challenged on their beliefs, or made out to be ignorant\/uneducated\/evil\/bigoted, and do not need to explain themselves to anyone for holding the beliefs that they do.\n\nFurthermore, please do not derail our threads with feminism and arguments for its validity. You are free to be a feminist and mention that you are a feminist here and how that affects your utilization of the RPW toolbox, but we do not need any proselytizing in the name of feminism here. That goes against the core values and origins of the sub and is unproductive for the community. **Ultimately, the mods will be removing any comments and posts that defend feminism in a way that antagonizes our anti-feminist core**.\n\nThank you!","title":"Rule 5: No Feminism","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/zg4nz2\/rule_5_no_feminism\/"}

Our life together has had many phases and due to work and other responsibilities, I have not played a very traditional role for most of it. \n\nYes I have done most of the cooking and always cared that he was fed, but never before have I been so consistent. It's always been \"are you hungry\/ do you want me to make you breakfast?\" Where sometimes it was a yes and other times a no... but the no wasn't coming from a lack of desire for my breakfast. It was him not wanting to be selfish or ask too much of me. I didn't see that and I didn't care to. I wifed like my mother wifed, as though it was a daily checkbox of burdensome obligations and hey, I asked, so therefore I get to check that box and go on with my day feeling good about myself while his perspective wasn't even on my radar.\n\nA year and a half ago is when we started caring more about our physical fitness. His goal was to gain weight and mine was to lose it. I actually thought about what that looks like for him, considered that he really struggles to eat big portions so therefore the best way to help him was to feed him more often. I need to save my first meal for later in the day so cooking breakfast is something I do just for him. \n\nI'm still amazed at myself because many-a-time I have thought \"He wants to gain weight, there's food in the house. What more can I do? It's up to him. I can't control his eating, it's his fault he won't just get up and eat.\" And yet this time I decided to make a meaningful attempt to help.\n\nI never realized until recently how significant all this is. \n\nHe told me the other day that my breakfasts changed his life. I was stunned, \"What, changed your life? What do you mean?\" He said that it's delicious and that it's steady and predictable, something to look forward to, makes him more capable of handling the day. This still doesn't sound life changing to me, it's just food! But I accepted his words without challenge and told him I was happy that I could help and we went on to have a great day.\n\n\nI just want to say to everyone here who finds it so easy to minimize their contributions... they matter more than you can possibly understand. The way you move through your day with gratitude in your heart, the way you let go of resentment and simply do things out of joy and not obligation, that is what makes you incredible and it's value can't be overstated.","title":"My husband told me that my making him breakfast every day \"changed his life\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/164kun0\/my_husband_told_me_that_my_making_him_breakfast\/"}

I know he will make a wonderful husband and father, and he has made clear his devotion and commitment to me. I couldn\u2019t be happier. \n\nI know that many of you are still searching. My heart breaks for the young women in 2018 who are looking for traditional love and marriage in a sea of feminism, boys who never seem to grow up, or serial players and plate spinners. I read your stories. The real men out there seem few and far between, and many of you have reluctantly chosen a less-than-ideal man you think might have potential with the right encouragement, which often ends in disappointment. It\u2019s easy to become discouraged and many women settle. \n\nBut one of the beautiful aims of this subreddit is to encourage women to abandon the typical female dating narrative of: how can I get a good man to commit to me? In favor of a superior question: what type of woman is worth committing to, and how can I become one? \n\nThe value of the man I\u2019m with is clear to women who know him well, who either pursue him to no avail, ex girlfriends who still say they lost the best thing they\u2019ve ever had, friends who tell me they want to find what I have, or cynically pretend he must be too good to be true. But these women have many things in common, expressing habits encouraged on college campuses and by feminism, habits that I myself had years ago, and habits that will be difficult to unlearn. I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I hope someone out there can find this advice helpful. \n\nBe beautiful, not \u201chot\u201d\nMen have two evolutionary mating strategies built into their biology (edit: see link to Weinstein podcast below). Women need to know this. The first is to get as much seed as possible into as many women as possible, and hope some children are born and turn out okay. This is the older, more animalistic strategy, but has worked for some. The second is more \u201cevolved.\u201d You find one woman, with the best genes possible, and have children with her, but stick around to ensure their safety, competence, and survival. Monogamy has been around for millennia. These two strategies remain in men today, indicated by men unanimously answering two questions in the affirmative (try it): can you imagine a woman who is hot, but not beautiful? Can you imagine a woman who is beautiful, but not hot? These terms differentiate which mating strategy will be used. Hot women are the women in porn, strippers, or in clubs. The women men know they could sleep with, but would never bring home to their mother. Beautiful women are still sexually attractive, but their attraction expands beyond the physical to grace, kindness, intelligence, and feminine charm. The key difference: beautiful women are still beautiful as they age, even past an age where they might not be fertile. All men can identify a beautiful older woman, but would never find them \u201chot.\u201d Men don\u2019t commit to hot women, because sex is their only value, and will be useless over 35. \n\nCollege campuses encourage women to be hot. My friends would dress in the tightest clothes, drink in excess, and be very sexually forward with the men they wanted attention from. Then, the next morning, wonder what they did wrong and why he isn\u2019t texting them back. Stop talking about sex. Women in college will talk about sex in front of men, about blow jobs, about funny stories from one night stands. It drives men crazy, and successfully gets those women all the attention in the room. But if you want marriage someday, being wanted isn\u2019t good enough. It feels good to be looked at and lusted after by men, and it can be intoxicating. I know, trust me. But you\u2019re appealing to the wrong dating strategy. Delete tinder. Stop snap chatting your body. Be beautiful, and someday you\u2019ll be wanted in a different way, for a lifetime not just a good time. And that is... extraordinary. \n\nI\u2019m realizing how long this post has become. I have many more things to say, and if you\u2019d like I can make a part 2, 3, etc. \n\nI hope you all have a lovely day. \n\nPart 2: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/94efea\/letter_to_young_women_part_2_the_charm_of_the\/","title":"A letter to young women","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/92zu21\/a_letter_to_young_women\/"}

My feminine side was squashed so much that the idea of even *trying* to pull mine back out sounded exhausting. \n\nI did it anyway, and it was, in fact, exhausting, but is now something I find so much joy and freedom in. \n\nI began by slowly implementing some of the lifestyle changes I\u2019ve read on the sub. I started really leaning into and embracing my feminine side by dressing nicer, putting some lotion on, making myself do my skincare routine no matter how done I was with the day, etc. I wasn\u2019t dating when I started any of this because I wanted to become secure in myself, and I wanted to learn how to maintain these habits for myself first, so that I wouldn\u2019t lose them in a relationship if they went unnoticed or anything. \n\nI went about this for several months, then decided I was ready to start dating. I approached dating FAR differently this time around, and focused on holding myself to higher standards, while giving men validation for their kindness, efforts, successes, intelligence, etc. \n\nY\u2019all. The number of times I have heard, \u201cYou\u2019re the only woman who has ever said that to me, thank you!\u201d is actually heartbreaking. The number of times I\u2019ve been thanked for being \u201cdifferent,\u201d when, after reading the sub, is really just leaning into what feels right by being supportive and genuine, is scary. It\u2019s scary because I realized I used to be the kind of woman who didn\u2019t lift men up, and still expected to be lifted up, and I am ashamed of that. I\u2019m ashamed that I was so afraid of being a \u201cpick me\u201d (ugh), that I was willing to sacrifice years of happiness and fulfillment within marriage or motherhood in the name of liberation and freedom, when I had that within myself all along. I just needed to be myself, which, for me, meant regaining the femininity I had lost and losing the entitlement I held. \n\nI really needed this sub, and that\u2019s why my immediate reaction was not great. And yet, I couldn\u2019t help myself from coming back, because deep down, I SO wanted the peace, love, joy, and humility you all had. I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m a lot closer to being the kind of woman I want to be, and I have all of you to thank for that. \n\nThank you for being such an uplifting group of women. I appreciate you more than you know.\n\n**Edit**: it won\u2019t let me comment yet, but I wanted to reply to u\/throwawayisathing who said they\u2019d love to see examples of validation. This is how I do it, feel free to let me know if I can improve! \n\nI use both online dating and in person, so I\u2019ll try to include both. \n\nI focus in a lot on the things they bring up, as well as anything in their photos or profile that they\u2019ve made a point to show. If they\u2019ve made a point to fill out a bunch of questions and allowed their personality to come through, I\u2019ll say something along the lines of, \u201cI appreciate how much time you put into your profile! Your personality really comes through, and I like that you\u2019re funny\/witty\/driven\/etc.,\u201d depending on what qualifies and traits I see. I assume those are the qualities they\u2019re most proud of, so I want to encourage that. If they mention they\u2019ve just gotten a new job, or just moved here, I always congratulate them and ask how they\u2019re adjusting and if they need any recommendations for anything, since I\u2019ve been in the area for years and know a bunch of places for food, tires, home repair, etc. \n\nIf they say something nice to me about my profile, I\u2019ll tell them that I appreciate the compliment, and that I love xyz about their photos and profile. I accept it, give my appreciation that they noticed and complimented me, and turn it around to compliment them right back. I usually aim to follow it up with a question, too, that way they\u2019re not having to carry everything. \n\nI\u2019ve found that asking questions and trying to listen more than I speak, and being sure I don\u2019t turn it back to myself and focusing in on what he\u2019s needing\/talking about\/doing, has helped me to uncover a lot of great things about the men I\u2019ve met, serve them appropriately and respectfully as someone who isn\u2019t their girlfriend or wife, and made it easier for us both to determine whether a second or third date is warranted. My goal is to always make them feel better than when they came into the conversation, regardless of where it leads. :)\n\n**I also wanted to thank everyone for the sweet encouragement and guidance in the comments. I\u2019m not surprised that this was met with a hug and a warm welcome because everyone here is so kind, but it means a lot regardless.

By June of 2019, we were trying in earnest. By September, I was tearfully asking him to get his semen tested. By February of 2020, we knew IVF was our only hope for children. Luckily for us, despite the pandemic, we were pregnant by the end of 2020 and I gave birth to two healthy girls in June.\n\nA librarian, I always planned to work full time when I had children, following in the footsteps of my mother and her mother and my dad's mother. My husband knew this from the beginning and we planned our life around this model. We thrived with two incomes and bought a home just 10 minutes from both of our workplaces. We took out credit cards and cashed in some investments to pay for our $30,000 worth of babies, knowing that, together, we'd make six figures and could afford to pay it off. Throughout my pregnancy, this was our plan. Even after I nearly died giving birth, we never discussed an alternative. I would stay home during my recovery and then I would go back, putting our girls in a nearby church daycare. I'd get to be the career woman *and* the mom. It's perfect, exactly as I've always hoped... *and it* *sucks.*\n\nFor six weeks now, my husband and I have been waking at 6:00 a.m. to feed our girls, before getting them ready for daycare and ourselves ready for work. We leave the house by 7:30 and drop them off at 7:45, together. We each go home for lunch, where we do chores that we don't want to do later, then finish the day at 5:00, when we head to the daycare. We get home at about 5:30 and try to balance daily tasks with enjoying our girls while they're awake. By 6:00, they're asleep and we can make dinner and eat before they have their final bottle at 8:00 and we put them down. We'd like to feed them earlier, but they'd go to bed that much earlier and we'd miss more of the cumulative hour or so we get with them. After we put them down, we do household chores and watch a show before bed. This is every night, until the weekend, when we have to run any and all errands, because we don't want to miss out on time with our babies during the week. Instead of enjoying them at home, we drag them around while we shop for groceries and get the oil changed and return packages and store purchases. Then we share them with family or friends, if there's some get together, before returning home to put them to bed.\n\nAll my life, I pictured having a career I cared about, where I worked full time, and then coming home to my family. I went to college and then grad school. I worked two jobs while carving my professional path. I got a job I loved with understanding managers and made good money. I had as close to zero commute as possible and a clean, safe, nearby daycare minutes away. It was the American dream and it was a lie. I have never considered myself a feminist, but I still thought I could do this. This is the model *most* people follow. Of course we would, too.\n\nSix weeks. I made it six weeks before handing in my notice to leave my \"dream job,\" the job I can't seem to build any enthusiasm for anymore. Everyone keeps telling me that it gets better, but when I ask how much time they get with their children at night, they almost always answer less than an hour. After two back-to-back rounds of Pandemic IVF, an emergency C-section due to extensive pneumonia and pregnancy-induced heart complications that impact .00001% of women, three blood transfusions, four days in the ICU and three more in labor and delivery... I get an hour with my girls each night. I have a cardiologist now and $9,000 in hospital bills, but I have *an hour* with my babies.\n\nLeaving my job has been one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make. I worked so hard for this. I *dreamt* of this. I *loved* what I do. I remember loving it... but I can't do it anymore. I keep thinking I'm weak, that other women do this all the time... but then I talk to them and realize that it doesn't get better. They just get used to it and those aren't the same thing. While I'd love to do the same job half time or part time, when the right opportunity comes along, full time employment is just an impossibility for me and will be for a very long while. I'm fortunate that my husband and I are in a situation where I can leave, but I'm so disappointed in myself and I feel so disillusioned. I'm a pretty traditional woman. I thought I *knew* that we couldn't have it all. I never considered this average suburban setup to *be* having it all, but here I am. It was all a lie.\n\nSo, to all the young women out there, forging your path, keep in mind that, no matter how much money you can make, you can't make more *time.* I may return to my library system half time, so I can still get the chores done and the errands run. I may homeschool and pursue a new dream in twenty years. I can always have a career, but I can only be with my girls while they're small once. I thought it was a clich\u00e9, but it's true.","title":"They lied to me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/qskjwk\/they_lied_to_me\/"}

We each do our best to make the other happy and in turn, our spouse does the same for us. When we each invest 100% into the other, we'll have a happy marriage. **The key is to provide what the spouse needs from us, which isn't necessarily the same as what we need from them**. \n\nSome people are dysfunctional or abusive and aren't capable of having a healthy, reciprocal adult relationship. It is **not** regarding these people that I write this post. \n\nSeveral months ago, u\/girlwithabike wrote a series of posts on the book for women only. I highly recommend reading the book as well as her posts on the book for a more in depth discussion on what will be presented here. \n\n**Step one - feed his ego** \n\nMen are human doings. One of the drawbacks of this is that men feel no self worth if they aren't accomplishing something and\/or useful to someone. If you have a husband, he has a core need to feel useful and to be admired for his skills and usefulness. \n\nA major area of expression for this deep seated need is the realm of finances. He needs to feel like his work is keeping the family afloat and that this is appreciated and admired by his wife. Conversely, being taken for granted or criticized for his accomplishments and hard work, will chip away at his sense of self worth and bring misery to his life. If you engage in this, he will have less and less desire to be around you. \n\nSame applies for smaller things. He cut the grass or shoveled the snow? Express your gratitude to him for doing so. Extra points if you do so in public. His love for you will grow with each compliment and each criticism or nagging is like another wound that will distance him from you. \n\n**Step two - keep his balls empty** \n\nMen don't enjoy talking as much as women do. Men bond with each other over physical activities. Likewise, he may engage in lengthy conversation with you because that's what you need, but what he needs is to connect with you regularly through touch. Affectionate touch, sensual touch, sexual touch. Buildup is wonderful, as long as he isn't left hanging with pent up sexual tension. \n\nExample - greet him at the door when he comes home from work. Spend a few minutes hugging and kissing him, groping and making out. Occasionally greet him in lingerie. Then settle him to relax while you get back to cooking supper. This will make him feel incredibly desired. \n\nAsk any man for the number one reason he agreed to get married and they'll probably tell you - to have a steady supply of sex. Men express love through sex and sex exponentially increases his love for you. If he feels sexually desired by you, he will feel like a million dollars. This can only benefit you. \n\nFurthermore, men are highly visual. The enjoyment of looking at you and being able to show you off cannot be underestimated. An ejaculation is cheap and he doesn't need you for that. He needs you for the desire, the sexual dance, the sexual bonding and yes, also the visuals. \n\nYou may look at your imperfect body and think that there's nothing to see here so why bother trying to look sexy or elegant. The famous (or infamous) okcupid study showed us that men are very charitable with regards to a woman's looks. Men aren't that rigid. If you make an effort to stay in shape and look good for him, to desire him sexually and to have an active sex life - you'll succeed because he's likely far less judgmental and far more forgiving than your female friends are. \n\n**Step three - keep his stomach full**\n\nMany people underestimate the importance of cooking for your husband. Can't he make his own damn sandwich is an oft heard trope. Yes. He sure can make his own sandwich and he could eat alone too, but that's not the point. \n\nWhen you cook for him and eat together with him whenever possible, you'll bond with him in a deep, emotional, non sexual level that's extremely important for a marriage. You'll cause him to feel important and cared for and this will go a long way. \n\nBy extension of this idea is keeping the house neat and clean and a warm friendly environment. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nThese three simple but powerful steps are a great new years resolution to make your marriage great again. \n\n* To keep his ego fed. \n* To keep his balls empty. \n* To keep his stomach full. \n\nCheers! \n","title":"3 simple steps to keep him smitten forever!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/a6scr8\/3_simple_steps_to_keep_him_smitten_forever\/"}

What a great day!! \ud83d\ude04\n\n(I thought about posting this in r\/relationship_advice but I have a feeling I would be \"shamed\" for some of the things in this post, so I really hope you all understand where I'm coming from!)\n\nI have been with my fiance since I was 18, and tomorrow marks 10 years total of being together. We are still so in love, can't keep our hands off each other and absolutely love being around one another. We are getting married next month and are planning to try for a baby later this year. I have been writing down a list of the things that I think has made our relationship so strong and I thought I would share! (Of course our relationship is **not** perfect and I'm not claiming that it is, this is just my personal experience.)  \n\n\n1. **We communicate everything.** This one is of course mentioned everywhere, in every relationship advice on the internet, but it's because it's so incredibly important. I personally have a hard time communicating my emotions verbally, and he knows that. I had to tell him that I have a hard time articulating my thoughts and that it overwhelms me when I have to explain *exactly* how I'm feeling, especially when I get flustered\/upset over something. A lot of times I would be upset about something, and because I couldn't accurately explain why I was upset (sometimes I would say I didn't even know why, which I'm sure was frustrating) he wouldn't understand how to help me. It has taken quite a while but recently he started doing something that has helped me so much. When I get upset, sad, flustered over something, he says \"What exactly about X is making you feel Y\". For example: \"What exactly about that email is making you feel overwhelmed?\" It allows me to take a step back and really take a look at my emotions from a logical perspective instead of being drowned in emotion and catastrophizing the situation.\n2. **We don't cuss, name call, or yell at each other.** I think in the past 10 years I have called him an asshole one or two times when I was really mad (this was in year 1 or 2 of our relationship). He has never ever cussed at me, or yelled. He has raised his voice of course, but he's never full on yelled at me. He talks very sternly. I honestly feel like a big reason for this is because we don't drink, so we never say something we didn't mean just because we we're intoxicated. This also contributes to having a peaceful home environment. \n3. **We are very sexually compatible.** Honestly this should be #1, although these aren't in any particular order. I cannot stress how important this is. If you are not compatible sexually, then you have a roommate, not a spouse. It's as simple as that. This doesn't have to be penetrative sex all the time, but we focus a lot on intimate moments throughout the day. He smacks my ass when I'm cooking, I run up and sneak a hug when he walks down the hallway or I straddle\/kiss him when he's laying on the bed. Sex is also frequent and amazing. I have to admit that the way he compliments me during sex\/oral makes me want to keep doing it because of the self esteem boost. Maybe that's vain of me, but it's the truth! He makes me feel like the most attractive woman in the world whenever we are intimate.\n4. **We share long hugs everyday.** Gosh I feel like I could write an entire novel on this. Hugs are very important in our relationship. Everytime we hug we really hold onto each other for a good 10-20 seconds. Sometimes this also involves me kissing his neck or him kissing my cheeks. I think longer hugs produce more feel-good hormones in your brain that make you closer to that person. We have something called a \"super hug\" where I lay on the bed and he lays on top of me hugging me while I wrap my legs around him. Our first hug we he gets home from work is my favorite and we usually tell each other that this is the best part of the day.\n5. **We haven't let ourselves go.** This one can be a sensitive topic to talk about, but it does need to be talked about. Of course age is going to have an affect on our bodies, and we aren't going to be attractive forever, but a lot of times people in relationships feel like they don't have to \"try\" anymore because they have their spouse and aren't on the dating market. This can lead to a lot of resentment, and I've seen it happen in many relationships before. A major mistake is dressing up *only* when you are leaving the house. I urge anyone out there to put a little bit of effort into your appearance on a daily basis. Before my fiance gets home from work I take about 15 minutes to make sure I look nice, have a cute outfit on and I'm clean. It doesn't take long and I know he appreciates it. I know it will be harder when we have children but I will do my absolute best to keep this up, along with working out and eating healthy.\n6. **I care about tending to his needs.** I make dinner almost every night and try to have it ready when he gets home from work. I like to give him massages, especially on his hands since he works with his hands. I enjoy sexually pleasing him and I don't turn him down. (I'm not a robot though, of course there's times where I don't enjoy it as much because I wasn't particularly in the mood, but he never makes me feel forced to do it.) He also tends to my needs as well both sexually and emotionally (when I need to vent he's there to listen).\n7. **We verbally compliment each other a lot.** This isn't just sexually, but it does include that. We always express how attractive we think the other person is. Hot, cute, sexy, smart, funny, masculine, feminine, hard working, etc. I love to tell him how I appreciate him and he tells me how he appreciates me.\n8. **We care about our hygiene.** This one may sound silly, but trust me it makes a huge difference. You want to have sex with your partner? *Shower. Shave. Smell good. Brush your teeth.* We have always been on the same page about this. And even though it can ruin the \"spontaneity\" of sex, we find that we enjoy it 10x more fresh out of the shower. Of course we still have sex and enjoy it if it has been a few hours since we showered, but we both prefer freshly showered.  \n9. **We try to argue fairly.** We honestly do not argue very often, but when we do I have found that I tend to let my emotions get the best of me, especially when I don't like what I'm hearing. I get quiet, put my head down and act like a child being scolded. Meanwhile he tends to harshen his tone of voice to the point where it almost sounds like he's talking down to me. I had mentioned to him during a casual conversation that I don't like when he talks to me in that harsh tone, and he didn't know what I meant. So the next time he talked to me like that I called him out on it and told him \"that's what I'm talking about.\" And he said \"Oh, thank you for pointing that out in the moment so I know\". And then he adjusted his tone. On the other hand, there was a time where he called me out for disconnecting and getting emotional over something just because I didn't like what I was hearing. I quickly snapped out of it and said \"You're completely right\" and changed my attitude. Learning to fight fair and not get too caught up in being \"right\" is a very hard thing to practice.\n10. **We are rooting for one another.** This is another way of saying we support each other, but I think saying we are rooting for one another gives a better description. We would never be jealous, envious or try to sabotage the other person trying to accomplish something. He has stuck with me through tons of failed businesses, and I've stuck with him when he was in between jobs and trying to figure out what he wanted to do. My success is his success and vice versa. I love sharing milestones together and striving to hit financial goals. \n11. **Bonus #11: We don't say \"I love you\" everyday.** I'm not sure if this actually contributes to our happy relationship, but I thought it might be interesting to add. From the very beginning he made it clear that he didn't want to get into the habit of saying I love you just to say it. It took 7 months for us to say I love you for the first time, and then from then on we said it maybe once every few months. This wasn't because we didn't love each other, but because we *showed* love more than just said the words. When we fall asleep holding hands, he doesn't have to tell me he loves me. When he takes my car to change the oil and wash it he doesn't have to say I love you.  We don't say it when we wake up, hang up the phone or go to bed. But let me tell you, when we **do** say it, I swear it feels like the first time. Gives me butterflies everytime.\n\nThere's other things that are important to have as well such as respect, integrity, loyalty, shared values and life goals, but I didn't want this post to be too long!\n\nThroughout our relationship I have always heard from people, \"just wait until you hit 7 years together, then you will really hate him!\" or \"just wait until you get married!\". It's as if it's expected that you will hate your spouse after a certain amount of time together. So I just wanted to let anyone out there know that it's possible to still be in love even after a decade +\n\nAnyways, I had a lot of fun writing this and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it!","title":"Tomorrow is my 10 year anniversary with my fiance; here are some things I've learned to cultivate a happy relationship","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/swt4y8\/tomorrow_is_my_10_year_anniversary_with_my_fiance\/"}

Women brag about making their man cook *and* clean, everybody is outraged if some woman asks for her husband's permission to do something, and so on. It *is* emasculating and toxic to relationships. Most men are hard-working individuals who stomach shitty bosses and histerical clients all day and the last thing they need is for their SO to scold them for leaving a dirty plate on the desk.\n\nThe feminine way to solve issues is to be non-confrontational and diplomatic. Kindness and sweetness de-escalates problems and makes peace. In her book, \"The Surrendered Wife\", Laura Doyle points out that constant criticism for irrelevant issues drives away romance and initimacy in a relatioinship. We can do the laundry ourselves and pick up the dirty socks from the floor without complaining about it, for our SO's who remembers to bring us flowers after their 10\/12 hour work day. A positive, calm and loving attitude will make our men want to please us even more, while complaining and demanding will make them bitter and leave us unsatisfied.\n\nBut ...\n\nI see a lot of women here asking for advice who seem straight-up afraid of tellig their men they have made a mistake! I see women hiding how upset their are, shielding their SOs from their emotions, dancing around the subject and raking their brains to find a way to speak their mind. We talk to our friends or to internet strangers, trying to find the best possible wording so that we do not seem critical, mean, emotional, ungrateful, etc. Stop.\n\nMen are not these brittle creatures who crack when faced with simple and honest criticism. Men do not spend an entire day going back over their words when they receive a snarky comment. *That's us, women.* Men don't get offended and they don't pout. They're not like ourselves, our mothers or our girlfriends., their frame of mind is not like our frame of mind. They have a special type of honor and dignity that makes them want to be responsable and own up their mistakes. They hate being told what to do, but them apologising now and then to their wife or girlfriend does not chip away at their self worth.\n\nMen love and want agreeable women, but that doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything all the time. They can handle being told when they are disrespectful or hurtful. Men want and love emotionally stable women, but they accept if we cry once a year and they expect us to be more emotional than them. You don't have to shield them from the negative feelings they gave you like you do with children. You don't have to carefully craft your words because they will interpret them like your female colleagues do. They won't cry in their room after a confrontation, listening to sad music.\n\nBy no means do I endorse bossing your man around, forcing him to apologise or lashing out at him. Be simple and honest, but speak your mind, say what your issue is and hold your head up straight. Your man won't fall off the shelf and shatter.","title":"Men are not made of porcelain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/n7kegs\/men_are_not_made_of_porcelain\/"}

A woman who is submissive to a man who feels no urge to take care of her, or a man who is protective of a woman who does not submit to him, will end up being harmed. \n\nWhen we understand this, we can see the reasoning behind the \"tone\" of TRP. It is a deliberate tactic for training men to suppress their protective instinct, necessitated by an environment full of women who are not submissive. \n\nIt is from here that we can realize a profound tactical implication for women who understand this. **If the teachers of TRP must work as hard as they do to suppress male protectiveness even of women who are not submissive, how hard can it be for a woman who IS to activate that same instinct?**\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is why RPW teaches submissive behaviour. It has nothing to do with tradition. It is not a religious law, or a moral obligation. It is simply *the best move* for dealing with any man who isn't severely damaged (how to identify those is a subject for another day). This is why \"drawing boundaries\" with your man, or \"negotiating\" with him \"from a position of strength\" may *sound* safe, but is a very bad idea. It is the decision to engage in conflict with the sex that is built for conflict, while in that very act sacrificing an incredibly potent advocate who *lives inside his own head*, past all his defenses. \n\nThe basis of any strong RPW strategy for navigating the risks of the sexual marketplace involves cultivating the ability to evoke this instinct in men. \n\nThis does not simply begin and end with deference or obedience, but rather consists of a whole host of behaviours calculated to draw the protective instinct out. It is, however, the *willingness* to behave in a submissive fashion to begin with that allows a woman to access, learn, and experiment with such strategies.

I am not telling anyone what to do in their own bedroom.\n\nBut we need to talk \u2013 seriously \u2013 about the yet unknown breadth of consequence of the modern day pornography industry to society, our men, our children. The recent thread on whether porn makes a man low value merely scratched the surface of a deep and fundamental question on modern gender relations and the near dystopian impending reality. \n\nChildren have been exposed to porn at increasing quality and accessibility at younger and younger ages, some studies say at an average age of 11, while others even claim it may be as young as 8. The claim of \u201cjust be a good parent, supervise children\u2019s screen time, set up parental restrictions\u201d is unbelievably short sighted and solutions are far from being viable. There is a reason alcohol and drug use is age restricted. During these incredibly sensitive years of brain development, dopamine saturation has long lasting and irreversible consequences on a child\u2019s ability to grow and develop healthy behaviors, leads to long lasting addiction proclivity, and porn specifically at young ages shapes the way children view sexuality. \n\nPorn is everywhere. Kids are on Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and have unmatched access to internet and screens in private, and restrictions in your home can\u2019t compete with the kids across the street. Porn or soft porn has saturated these markets, and if you think that won\u2019t have a lasting impact on our kids and future men and women, you are na\u00efve. And the snowball will continue to grow as technology moves towards more advanced VR media and masturbation technology. \n\nAnything that gives us dopamine hits is addictive. Unhealthy foods packed with fat and sugar, nicotine, alcohol, and other drugs are universally accepted as addictive and unhealthy, even if you partake in these vices only occasionally. I get it, YOU might be able to watch porn occasionally and without detriment to your relationship or lifestyle, but we are vastly underestimating the prevalence of this addiction and the consequences. We can\u2019t analyze the long term effects of a vice that is *universal* because there is no control group*.* What percent of men do you believe have *never* watched porn? Less than one percent?\n\nI am not so insecure to believe my man does not look at attractive women. I understand testosterone and I understand men, and men have been looking at women for millennia. But as a community striving to understand gender relations between men and women in the modern age, RPW must take this conversation seriously and must understand the difference between masculine sexuality and widespread pornography addiction. When will we accept this as a crisis and understand there our boys and fathers and brothers and partners need help and need society to treat this problem with the seriousness of any other addiction? Yes, you may believe *your* marriage is fine, *your* partner is fine, but what about the devastating consequences to millions of others? What about your children? What about the societal impacts on marriage and community? \n\nThere is a new group of young men who have realized how much better their lives become when not watching porn, finding more focus, drive, confidence, and color in the day to day. They have helped many men overcome this addiction and advocate for it adamantly. I believe in their movement, it has drastically improved countless lives and relationships, including my own partner before we met. I hope we can find a sensible solution as a society, and I encourage all of you to consider your unexamined assumptions and apathy towards the effects of porn on our culture, and bring compassion and light towards many around you who might be suffering silently, to consider how we might raise this next generation with a whole new set of challenges. I hope you all are having a beautiful Wednesday.","title":"The Consequences of Pornography","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/e9hjon\/the_consequences_of_pornography\/"}

I used to come here periodically under another username, but decided to delete that account after someone attempted to doxx me. Anyway, I have been following the advice here and the advice found in the book Fascinating Womanhood for the past year or so, and wanted to say this stuff is truly a path to a peaceful, thriving relationship.\n\nMy marriage to my husband has been rocky at best for most of our relationship due to my past mental health issues and always, most of the time unknowingly, emasculating him. What do I mean by emasculating him? Making him the butt of my jokes with my family and friends, always doubting his decisions when he tells me we are going to do something, etc. Anyway, a year ago it was beyond obvious that we were both miserable so I decided to change lots of things about myself. \n\nI got professional help for my issues and started doing some soul searching on how to be a better wife. That's how I found this sub. Then, I put in the work. I bought some cute, albeit sexy, negligee to wear to bed, started doing some light makeup even though I work from home, and started putting more effort into keeping a clean house. I also had a really bad habit of bombarding my husband with what he calls \"word vomit\" as soon as he walked into the door. I'd unload on him my frustrations about work related gossip, how much work the house was to maintain, etc. before he even got to take his coat off. But I stopped that and it's been night and day.\n\nMy husband, dare I say it, adores me now. My birthday was last weekend and my husband who is a self proclaimed non-romantic spoiled me in ways that I did not think he was capable of. He woke me up with coffee and breakfast in bed and told me the day was mine. Whatever I wanted to do that day, we would do. He ended up drawing me a hot bath, lit some candles, made me a cocktail, and took our rambunctious dogs who never leave my side, with him for an hour so I could have some quiet, alone time. Then he happily made me dinner before we watched one of my favorite movies together before bed. \n\nEverything in our relationship has improved. It feels light and fun and he says the highlight of his day is coming home now everyday. We communicate so much better, and because I stopped doubting his every decision, he opens up to me more now. He gets the final say in everything, but he values my opinion and that makes it easier for me to allow him to lead.\n\nTLDR: If you're doubting the advice here, just know that it is literally life's cheat code to having a great relationship with a great man.

He got home late from work after a meeting that put him in a bad mood, and he quite clearly wanted nothing to do with me or the rest of the world for a while. So I let him be for a few hours, made dinner (it was amazing, by the way -- braised chicken with mustard cream sauce, yum ;) ), and let him decide when any interaction would take place. He came into the kitchen as I was washing some dishes, and the first thing he did was apologise for having been so cold when he got home. I firmly believe that if I had not just let him be, and had instead bothered him to pay attention to me, to help with something or other, he would have never given such a tender and sincere apology.\n\nAnyway -- a bit later, after dinner, we decided to just lay in bed and talk for a while. And it was at that time that I decided to do something I had been thinking of for a while, but that, truthfully, I was a little nervous to actually say out loud. \n\n\"You know, I kind of get the feeling that you're the one in charge, between the two of us.\"\n\nI think that at first he took it as a reproach, because he started trying to explain it away, but I stopped him and said that no, actually, I really appreciated it. That I trust him completely and that I love being able to follow and submit to him when circumstance allows. He laughed a bit and said that I must not be a feminist -- but actually, I am. And *this* is my choice, *not* my obligation. \n\nIt was really wonderful to see him cheer up considerably, and (very!) reassuring that he told me he wouldn't take advantage of my devotion. \n\nIt was a heartwarming moment and felt like a small victory, but not one that I could really share with people outside this sub, so here I am giving a giddy \"morning after\" field report.

Friends who are very much in their feminine energy also are very popular, even if they haven't met the right one yet. It really doesn't matter how beautiful or hot you are, if you manage to do these things guys will absolutely love you and not only want to bang you.\n\n1. **Be vulnerable**\n\nSounds like weird advice but a man needs to connect to your heart. I had some horrible things happen to me in my teenage years but I noticed that when I disclosed this to a man he felt much more connected and protective of me. I had more than once a man confess his love to me the same night I told him this.\n\nYou don't have to have a horrible trauma to make this work. Be open with your emotions, if you are sad don't hide it! When a man asks you how you are tell him how you feel.\n\nImagine you get a 'how was your day?' text from a man you are dating for a short while, respond with something that made you feel something that day. It's best to keep it positive if you aren't in a commited relationship\n\nEx. 'I went to the beach with my dog today, I always feel so free when I walk by the shore!' or 'I was a little under the weather, so I spend some time under a blanket today, it felt so cosy and warm.' Make him feel what you feel.\n\n2. **Be receiving**\n\nI'm not necessarily talking about gifts. I'm talking about any form of receiving. The most important one being energy. Masculine energy is forward moving, giving, thinking, taking care of business, feminine energy is being and receiving.\n\nA good way to start is to physically move back in your chair, lean back and let your date lead the conversation. Don't think about what amazingly funny thing you want to tell him after he is done speaking, listen to what he is saying for a change.\n\n3. **Don't try to make things happen**\n\nThat's the man's job. When he sends you a text that's fine, if he doesn't that's also fine. Be in a headspace of seeing what will happen (this doesn't mean not having boundaries btw) but don't be desperate to have a relationship after one date.

One of my core beliefs is that a good sex life will elevate the quality of a relationship and more often than not, it is the glue that keeps two people together when times get rough. \n\nDisclaimer: I have a somewhat high N count, I've mostly seen and done it all. Am I ashamed of it? No, as I always approached sex with curiosity and carefully selected my partners. Would I advise a potential daughter to act the same way? Also no, although I believe some experience can go a long way. Hence, the point of this post. A smart person learns lessons from other people's experience, doesn't necessarily jump head in to make their own mistakes. I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel here, but to challenge each of us to step it up a notch between the sheets.\n\nAs we all know, sex is VERY important to men. It could be argued that sex is what draws men to women in the first place. Sure, a family, a 'partner-in-crime', a nice meal, maybe even children are nice prospects to the majority of men, but I've yet to see a truly happy guy who doesn't get quality sex from his wife. **It's amazing just how many 'relationship issues' could be resolved in the bedroom.** \n\nI also believe there's a huge difference between 'sex' and an amazing, hot, steamy session in the bedroom (or any other place, really - but more on that later). Sure, to a man who's been starved for sex all his life, getting it once a week in the missionary position would be a pretty sweet deal, but it can get so much better than that, for you and for him. \n\n**A. First, start with YOU.** Great sex is about GIVING, about **putting the other person's desires above your own** and you can't give if you feel drained yourself. For women, desire is a tricky business. We have to FEEL and perceive ourselves as sexy in order to really want it. Make it a mission to work out, take care of yourself, eat right and pamper yourself from time to time. Get acquainted with your body, spend a few minutes every day naked, looking in the mirror and start appreciating yourself. We all have physical qualities, find them and start loving yourself. \n\nYour body is a temple, treat it with love and care and you'll see the wonders it can do. Have light meals, never eat until you're full and start liking salads and healthy smoothies. Pay attention to your weight and fitness level, we all have 24 hours in a day, it's not at all difficult to work out at least 30 minutes each day. Make it two sessions 15 minutes each if you have to, but just do it. Working out also slightly increases your testosterone level, which, you guessed it, makes you want more sex. Find a hair removal routine that works for you and keep yourself trimmed at all times. Take care of your skin, hair, nails. **A woman can be sexy well into her 50s, never ever give up on yourself.** You only have one shot at life, make it as good as possible. Now.\n\nLast but not least, **learn to please yourself**. Touch yourself, let your imagination run wild and notice what you respond best to. Learn to give yourself orgasms so that you can guide your man to better please you. A man who loves you will get greater pleasure in seeing you enjoy sex with him than in his own orgasm. This is one sure way to make him feel like a man, like THE man. Sex is your realm and one of your biggest assets, use it wisely.\n\n\nB. HIM. Again, **men LOVE good sex.** The though of getting a good romp later during the day could very well be the main reason they get up every morning and go conquer the world (no matter how big or small their world is). They work out, learn game, acquire wealth, provide resources just to get the best sex they can. This alone speaks volumes. \n\nThe only men I met that claimed they were not really into it, were those who never actually got to enjoy good sex. Once they did, they were ready to give their all and much more to the woman who knew how to make them feel good in the bedroom.\n\n**The thought of a lifetime of steady sex with his sexy girlfriend is what makes a man want to commit further and take a shot at marriage.** When you look at it this way, I cannot fathom why on earth would a woman let herself go and reject the husband of HER choice. Sexual rejection stings horribly for men and transforms them into doormats and chumps, who feel inadequate and failing at life. Guess where will that take them? Yup, getting fat, depressed and withdrawn. It is my belief that a woman can easily bring her husband up and encourage him just by providing him with good sex. It's also true that she can easily tear him down by constant rejection.\n\n\nC. The Relationship. Ok, you've dated and vetted and found a guy who gives you the tingles and is also a good prospect. It's time to take your relationship to the physical realm and you're both nervous and eager. After all why wouldn't you be? You like this man and want to make it work. **Knowing the importance men place on sex, you may tend to get all worked up over making it a pleasant experience for both of you.**\n\nSome men are experienced and dominant. They really know what buttons to push and make you lose it and submit to them. Should he also be looking for a serious relationship (which you already know, via good vetting), this is the ideal case. Let him lead, do not be afraid to show him you want him and let him woo you.\n\nThe majority didn't get the chance to actually enjoy good sex with a woman. Maybe they're young. Maybe they're inexperienced. Maybe their ex was a shrew, a bitchy self-proclaimed nympho who was way too centered on her own pleasure. It's with these men you really need to be careful and this is where knowing and loving yourself really proves crucial. Usually, if you let one of these guys lead, the first time won't be a very sexy experience and it might get him to close off and you'll have a much difficult time helping him open up later on. Maybe he finishes too soon. Maybe he doesn't know what to do, he's too aggressive or too timid. **Again, show him you want him and COMING FROM A PLACE OF SUBMISSION, take the lead.** Caress him, guide him as to where you like to be touched, get down on your knees and blow him, then gently whisper in his ear you're ready for him. **Don't get your hopes up for the first time, getting to a point where sex is really good, for you and for him, takes time and dedication.** Don't show him everything you know in one go. Surprise him, but don't pull all your cards at once. Let his mind wander on which other thoughts of ways to please him go through that pretty head of yours.\n\nFfw, some time has passed, you know each other and your relationship has progressed. **Now it's the time to get really freaky.** Don't be afraid to pose for your man. Send him sexy nudes when he's away. Go buy some new lingerie just to show it off. Try out clothes in front of him, dress up, even if it's just for a chill evening at home. **Get out those sexy heels he likes, make the house your catwalk and I guarantee he'll snap out of whatever he may be doing.** You think he's watching too much TV in the evenings while you slave away cleaning up the house? Forget about cleaning the kitchen, put a V-neck sweater or some short shorts and go dust the living room table or the shelves. He'll drop the remote like it's going out of style and start eyeing you like crazy. \n\nPlay with him. Don't be afraid to (gently) moan during sex, tell him you find him sexy, when you think he looks good in that shirt or when he's changing the tire. Forget about all your insecurities and really, TRULY, love your man from head to toe. Master your BJ skills, train your gag reflex so you can surprise him with a deep-throat session. Be open to anal, you might even get to enjoy it yourself. Talk about what you'd like and ENCOURAGE him to speak about his fantasies. **Never belittle him, never show yourself disappointed. You both have a lifetime together to learn mutual pleasure.** Give all of yourself to him, be his sexual slave, listen to him. Throw all of your insecurities out the window, this man chose you for YOU, the bedroom is not the place to be insecure. Casually walk around the house naked when he's busy doing his own thing and enjoy feeling his gaze following you. Don't be afraid to have sex everywhere in the house or in the car. Take him out for a night of stargazing to a remote place and blow him while he's watching the night sky. \n\nGet accustomed to his semen. It's just a body fluid. Swallow, let him come anywhere on your body, show him you love every tiny bit of him. After all what's the worst that could happen? It stings when it gets into your eyes but so do countless pesky little flies throughout your life. If you find he tastes too bitter and it makes you sick, tell him that, advise him to hydrate properly, drink less beer (as beer usually makes semen very bitter) and instead, incorporate more pineapple into his diet.  He'll be more than happy to oblige and you've also successfully saved him from some useless carbs and made his diet healthier.\n\n**Please notice I never mentioned anything about you asking or demanding stuff from him. Talk about what you like but NEVER demand.** Maybe he'll like going down on you, maybe he won't. If he doesn't and you really really want it badly, then ask yourself if this is something you can compromise on. **Focus on GIVING him the best sex of his life and he'll reciprocate.**\n\nAlways try something new, flirt with him, **even after 20 years together, you have a duty to be desirable to your husband.** In turn, he'll also keep desirable for you. No man will let himself go knowing he won't be able to have all that amazing sex anymore. **He will think long and hard and you'll have to really screw up to get him to leave you, when his sexual needs are met in a way that makes him think none of his friends get the quality sex he does.** Tell him how turned on by him you are and enjoy the thought that he gets hard the next day at work just by thinking about what you did to him last night. Encourage him to talk about this too then connect through sharing a moment like this when you're out to dinner with friends and he can't get up as his erection is showing. Create sexual memories together regarding places. While we`re at it, sometime when you're out, dressed all classy, like the good girl you appear to be, get up, go to the bathroom, get off your panties, come back and place them in the palm of his hand. He'll go crazy with desire and you will have created a good memory together.\n\n\nIn closing, while you enjoy a stellar sex life which makes you act and feel younger and the thought that your man gets hard by just thinking of you, you'll also notice he's much more willing to do his share of the household chores, listen to you when you`ve had a bad day and be overall, much more connected to your needs and desires as a woman.\n\n **Never close the door on your partner's desires, but strive to open up as many windows as possible, until you can peek into his innermost persona and he into yours.**\n\nLATER EDIT: **Not being in the mood is NOT an excuse to reject your man.** Sometimes however, there'll be days when all hell breaks loose and you can't wait for them to be over so sex might very well be the last thing on your mind. Even then, if you see your partner is in the mood, try to reciprocate as best you can. **Still, sometimes our bodies just don't feel it, even to the point that penetration is very difficult, if not impossible. In those cases a gentle delay and waking him up with an enthusiastic BJ the next morning is a much better alternative than just lying there, waiting for it to be over.** However, this should be an emergency situation, not a weekly occurrence. For example, there was this only one time this year I rejected my boyfriend. It was a particularly long day at work, also had to juggle 3 different job interviews all throughout town carrying a laptop in my backpack in a dreadful humid heat and on top of that, it was also the first day of my period. When I got home, I just wanted it all to be over, but my bf wanted some attention. Feeling horribly ashamed, I gently declined, but made sure to be extra sweet and attentive to his desires for the next week. **Don't force yourself to do something your body tells you not to, you'll only start building resentment.** Also, our bodies tend to have a certain sensorial memory, if sex hurt badly last time you did it, next time you'll notice you have trouble getting wet and relax. But don't make this a habit, this should really be just a very, very RARE exception to your eagerness to please your man.\n\nL.E2: It just stuck me that I've never said anything about size & duration. These are sensible topics, tread carefully. \n\nIf your guy is well endowed, he probably knows it. Never skip the chance to tell him how good it feels. The reverse of this is, if he's on the rather small side, don't lie. Find other things to compliment him about, like his technique, his abs and all that. How would you feel if someone told you you've got a beautiful nose when you know you objectively don't? Yeah, lied to your face, maybe like he's trying to gain something from you. Don't do this to your man, it would be a huge faux-pas. Also, a smaller penis might actually work better in the long term too. I'm a small woman and the thought of getting stretched at least once daily for years doesn't really sound like the perfect scenario. Rather, his 'tool' should 'fit' and that usually can be seen in how well you 'fit' physically as a couple. My encounters with tall men have all turned painful after a while. Also, for the curious out there, if you want to get an approximation of his size & girth down there, look at hands and especially his fingers. I've found they are very telling.\n\nHow long he lasts in bed is also a hot-topic. Some guys really last for hours or might even have trouble finishing but that also tends to get a painful really fast. Most guys however, don't. Never make him feel bad for this. You can get your orgasm next time, or, learn to get there faster. Rather, take it as a compliment and feel proud. How long he lasts can be improved in time, with patience. Also, the more diverse, steamy, regular sex a guy has, the easier it is for him to last longer.","title":"A Good Relationship Is Built In The Bedroom","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6thx5r\/a_good_relationship_is_built_in_the_bedroom\/"}

I loved how honest you ladies were with me.\n\nAnyway, I was prompted to write this post after watching Lauren Southern's \"What Every Girl Needs to Hear\" video (go watch it if you haven't already). She discusses how promiscuity has a detrimental effect on a woman's ability to pair bond with a partner.\n\nTo all of my fellow college RPW out there, *please*, don't let **anyone** convince you that you're missing out by not riding the CC. Maybe you're like one of my best friends, who has been in a committed relationship with a great guy for a few years, but you see your friends going out and meeting new guys every weekend and wonder if you should be doing that too, because that's what modern society dictates college-age women should be doing. It bothered her so much that she considered asking her boyfriend to open up the relationship, even though they've talked about marriage. **That's how brainwashed our generation has become.**\n\nAs someone whose n-count is in the 20s, I told her, point blank: **it's not worth it**. \n\nI mentioned in my last post that I have bipolar, and that I am hypersexual when I'm manic. This resulted in my count going from 1 to 20+ in a matter of 6 months. All of these were hookups.\n\n**9 times out of 10, guys who want to hook up with you DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. AT ALL.**\n\nYou're just a plate to them, no matter how nice they seem to be. That's the *best case scenario*. There are also men out there who can seriously hurt you. I was raped by one last year. That just goes to show the kind of people you can come across when you venture into the world of meaningless sex. They have no regard for your feelings, or, in some cases, your personal safety.\n\nGiven my high n-count, I feel that sex isn't as special to me anymore. I have to actively try to feel the connection with my partner, when previously it came naturally and effortlessly. I can still feel it, but it doesn't feel as strong as it did before. \n\nAlso, I can't help comparing my current partner to all of the partners I've had in the past. It keeps me from truly enjoying everything he has to offer.\n\nDon't sabotage your ability to pair bond just so you can fit in with your blue pill friends. Sex is very important to men (and women, too). For most men, it's how they feel most connected with their partner. Like men, I also primarily prefer giving and receiving love through physical intimacy, and now I feel like my ability to receive has been compromised. Trust me, you *don't* want to be in my shoes.\n\nI know it's highly unlikely for a woman in this day and age to save herself until marriage or have a count of 1 unless it is in the context of a religious upbringing, but at least try to limit your sexual encounters to men you are in committed relationships with. It's not just because of retaining your ability to pair bond, or keeping your RMV high, but simply put, **sex is better with someone you love and who loves you**. \n\nMy fellow young RPW, don't sell yourself short. \n\n\n","title":"Promiscuity and pair bonding","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6n4csz\/promiscuity_and_pair_bonding\/"}

Or why teenagers and college students experiment with light-hearted negs to their classmates? Or why grown men write and read extensive guides on [how to tease the women they\u2019re attracted to](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheRedPill\/comments\/4wu6n4\/humansockpuppets_guide_to_teasing_bitches\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)? (warning: if you\u2019re sensitive to TRP crudeness, best to skip that post \ud83d\ude05, although I found it pretty funny and insightful)\n\nWhile one part of it has to do with how a successful playful tease often gets the teased woman feeling more attracted to the teaser, I think another part of it is that men **love** to see our reactions to their teases as well. There\u2019s just *something* [intoxicating](https:\/\/66.media.tumblr.com\/e690cc6fb6368d77d3918afe3f03dcfa\/tumblr_oq6kuw2BOK1thej0ko1_500.gif) to men when a beautiful woman breaks into an unguarded, genuine giggle, with blushing, red cheeks and bashfulness thanks to whatever they just did or said to you.\n\nWhy is this tiny, insignificant moment so powerful at pulling at his heartstrings and triggering his protective instincts, even if for a split second? Three reasons.\n\n1. **Childlike wonder and endearment**. And no, I don\u2019t mean in a creepy, pedophilic way. I mean in a young at heart, lust for life kind of way. When you let your walls down, stop thinking about your worldly stresses, and allow yourself to be open to *feeling* and *experiencing* the moment with the wide-eyed enthusiasm of a child, this makes men want to protect you like no other.\n\nThis is explained in great detail by [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6k7y4y\/childlike_vs_childish\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) fantastic post, quoted below:\n\n> **Childlike affection.** Ever seen a little girl hug a puppy, or kiss her parents? Or beg her daddy for a piggy back ride? Giggle when someone harmlessly teases her? She's open with her emotions, she's not afraid to show her love. She gives her affection to those that are dear to her.\n\n> **Childlike enjoyment.** Think about a little girl eating ice cream, enjoying her favorite lasagna, putting on a pair of beautiful earrings, painting her nails, singing along to her favorite song. She's happy about the simple things in life. She's uninhibited with the pleasures of the world.\nAny good woman knows how to control her emotions - to switch from being functional to being childlike, and a talented RPW knows how to assess which situation requires which quality. \n\n2. **Contextual submissiveness**. When we say that we use submissiveness as a strategy, many outsiders, frustrated self-proclaimed tomboys, and angry feminists think that we\u2019re basically offering ourselves up to be our lover\u2019s footstool. While I\u2019m not one to kink-shame if that\u2019s your thing, realistically, submission is much more subtle and nuanced than that. \n\nAs a reaction to teasing, playful bashfulness can be a tell for your submissiveness because a) you\u2019re choosing to be in his frame, b) you\u2019re receptive and reactionary to his actions, and c) you expose enough vulnerability (while not really risking anything) by allowing his teasing to get to you.\n\n3. **Dimorphic femininity.** Men don\u2019t just tease *us.* They love teasing their bros and close friends and even their coworkers. However, when they tease each other, they expect masculine rambunctiousness and poisonously witty comebacks. It\u2019s sometimes a test or a filter to get a somewhat decent understanding of the male pecking order in the room, based on each other\u2019s reactions. \n\nBut that kind of energy isn\u2019t what they\u2019re looking for in their potential lovers or their long-time partners. While most masculine men are somewhat unimpressed, if not weirded out, by blushing and bashful men, they love seeing that kind of reaction in us because it\u2019s incredibly feminine.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t sprinkle in a bit of wit and sass when you react to being teased. You can and often should, just to make it a little bit more fun. However, take note to keep things playful, feminine, and lighthearted as to not cross into the masculine reaction territory. There\u2019s a big difference between, \u201cHey hey hey, I\u2019m watching you mister!\u201d vs. \u201cOI if you weren\u2019t such a low-IQ c*nt then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have had to comfort your mum after school when you were in remedial english\u201d (yeah, pretty glad I\u2019m not a man because I would get absolutely FLAMED for my terrible comebacks \ud83d\ude02).\n\n\u2014\n\nWhile most of these examples revolve around teasing, playful bashfulness can be utilized in almost any situation. Showing off your new outfit to your man? Having some playful bashfulness shows that you don\u2019t take yourself too seriously but you\u2019re still endearingly nervous about his reaction. Fumble your words a little bit? Playful bashfulness lets you play it off AND touch his heart at the same time. Incorporate it enough in your interactions with the man you\u2019re dating or your LTR and all of a sudden, he begins to associate you with the warm, fuzzy feeling in his belly that he gets from your playful bashfulness.\n\nNow, I\u2019m NOT telling you to feign this in order to impress men. Unlike how the media loves to portray them, men, especially the attractive and highly capable men we want, aren\u2019t stupid and can spot inauthentic behavior pretty easily. Instead, I\u2019m telling you to STOP. FIGHTING. IT. When men genuinely make you feel this way, don\u2019t hide it in some misguided attempt to have the upper hand. Embrace it and wear it on your sleeve. It\u2019ll only serve to benefit you and strengthen your bond with him.","title":"Playful Bashfulness: My Secret Weapon to Melting His Heart","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/o8wgu3\/playful_bashfulness_my_secret_weapon_to_melting\/"}

Natural is hunting and gathering. Natural is sleeping under a tree. Natural is being constantly pregnant between the ages of 11 and 35. Natural is dying in your thirties of rotten teeth. In short, natural, the way modern people use the word, is what happens if you don't do something to oppose entropy. \n\nSo do not mistake natural for good, healthy, or desirable. \n\nYou are not trying to live as you would in the natural state of humanity... you are trying to do far, far better than that. Doing far, far, better than that is why humans invented civilization and technology in the first place. We are trying to improve our lives over the state of \"natural\". \n\nWhen you shave your legs, you are not just imitating a young, healthy, high-estrogen girl's pale, fine, and less-visible leg hair... you are exaggerating it. When I lift heavy barbells, I am not simply imitating the effects of high natural testosterone, I am greatly exceeding them. A house built of timber and drywall isn't a substitute for a shade tree on the African savannah, or a cave... it is a vast improvement upon it. Willow bark is natural. Ibuprofen is not. Guess which one works better? \n\nThe history of human civilization is nothing but the story of how humans tried to improve upon nature... and usually succeeded. This required effort. This required humans to leave their comfort zone, and do things they they had not tried before. This required the willingness to plan, try, fail, plan again, and try again. \n\nIf you don't want to cultivate those things, then the notion that everything worth doing should be \"natural\" will seem very tempting. But this is just wishful thinking. If improvement were easy, it would not be considered improvement, because everyone would already have done it.\n\nYou're going to have to work.","title":"Don't fall for \"natural\".","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/d2bzm5\/dont_fall_for_natural\/"}

Some people took issue with this, arguing that your children should come before your husband. I will make a case for why your husband should always be the center of your universe. \n\n_________________________\n\n\nMarriage is a unique bond, unlike any other. It's a fragile bond that will easily disintegrate if left unattended. \n\nDid you ever not see your sibling for a few months? Did you ever not see a close friend for a few months? When you meet up once more, you can continue where you left off. \n\nYou can do no such thing in marriage. If you don't constantly nurture the bond, it will quickly unravel. \n\nThe bond you have with siblings and friends, is a bond based on sameness. Thus, it is a bond that is cold and still. You can leave it alone for a while and pick up where you left off.\n\nThe bond of marriage is a bond of opposites. There are always opposite forces at play, pulling you apart. You must be active to keep the bond going. Thus, this is a fiery, passionate bond that is in constant motion. A bond that must always be actively maintained. \n\nTherefore, if you want your marriage to survive - let alone, thrive - you must treat your husband as the center of your universe. \n\n> But how can you neglect the needs of your children?\n\nGood question. This is perhaps the only caveat that I'd place. Yes, when there is an immediate need, you must tend to the helpless child before you tend to your husband. \n\nObviously! The baby cannot change its own diaper, cannot feed itself, clothe itself etc.\n\nHowever, you don't need to be doing this 24\/7. Even when life gets hectic, you can still make your husband feel like the center of your universe. A simple example of this would be to express appreciation for what he does and yearning for longer and deeper connection in the future. You can always nurture that flame, each and every day. \n\nWhen you aren't constantly putting out fires with the children - a little planning goes a long way. Plan into your schedule, daily bonding time with him. I remember growing up, my parents spent 30-45 minutes having tea together every night and we were not allowed in! Yes, sometimes their tea was shortened or canceled due to a screeching baby\u2026 but generally speaking, they made a point of doing it every day and they're still at it!\n\nTending to the needs of dependent children, need not interfere with prioritizing your husband. \n\n> But my husband is a grown adult who can care for himself!\n\nYes. He certainly is. I'm sure he took care of himself just fine, before he met you. He didn't marry you because he **needs** you, he married you because he **wants** you. \n\nAs explained earlier, the marriage bond will disintegrate if left unattended. You may have a thousand reasons and justifications for why you shouldn't have to treat him as your number one priority, but if you want a successful marriage - this is what you need to do. \n\n> But I don't want to turn him into a narcissist. \n\nDon't worry about that. The world will give him plenty of beatdowns and lessons in humility. Your job is to be his biggest fan, his support team, his cheerleader, his safe space. \n\n> But it feels weird. \n\nYes. I understand that. I felt that way too. As mentioned in the previous post, my marriage was unraveling because I was acting based on all the justifications, including the fact that it felt weird. This is part of the toxicity of the current zeitgeist\u2026\n\nMy grandmother showed me the way on this. I have come to appreciate that the way she treated my grandfather, wasn't merely an antiquated way from the olden days. \n\nNo! She was actively nurturing her marriage, every single day! As soon as I started acting more like her, my marriage too, began to blossom and bloom, just like hers. And you know what - the resulting benefits, melted away the awkward feelings!\n\nIn conclusion, treating your husband as the center of your universe, is about continuously nurturing the fragile bond that is marriage. Children present challenges to navigate, to keep this flame alive. Children should not be an excuse to get lazy and allow your marriage to disintegrate.","title":"Your husband comes before your children.

It seems like once a month I read the following:\n\n*My husband has been out of work for the last 18 months, since he was fired from the Dog Food Factory. Initially, he was really depressed, so he'd spend his days playing video games and complaining about how unjust the whole thing was... except that it really wasn't. He called in sick all the time, because he didn't feel like going to work, since he hated his boss. I didn't want to say anything, because I read RPW and know the importance of STFU, so I trusted him to be responsible... but he wasn't. After a few months of video games and moping, I assumed he'd start putting in job applications and going on interviews, especially since I was working double shifts with our first baby on the way. Now it's been a year and a half of being the dutiful and faithful wife. I encourage him and spoil him, even though I'm exhausted from new motherhood and 60 hour work weeks, but he won't put in any applications! I'm trying so hard to keep my mouth shut, but I'm not sure how long I can go on like this!*\n\nSTFU is not a directive to be a doormat. It's a sign of trust and respect, both of which are *earned and reciprocal*. If your husband is intentionally sabotaging his current job or has been unemployed for an extended period of time, without looking for new work, he's not respecting you as his wife or himself as the leader of your household. He's abusing your trust and loyalty. A similar situation:\n\n*My boyfriend and I have been living together for five years. When we moved in, the plan was to get engaged within a year and married within two. We were both on board with this and excited about it. However, my boyfriend hasn't mentioned engagement since shortly after we signed the lease. I've been reading RPW and I know I should continue to STFU, but it's been* ***five years*** *and I'm about to turn 28! I'm not sure if anything will ever change, if I don't speak up.*\n\nWhile the above boyfriend isn't neglecting his family, he is disregarding the goals and the plans you made together. He's disrespecting the parameters he set *with you* and wasting your time if he's changed his mind without saying so. In both situations, you're completely within your rights to *speak up,* because you're strongly impacted. STFU isn't intended to reward steamrolling or abusive behavior. It's a method of respectfully placing your trust in your partner. So what *does* it look like?\n\nA few months ago, my husband and I were expected to go to dinner with his supervisor... who he *hates* and still thinks is a moron. I didn't want to go, because I know he finds the man insufferable, but the supervisor was paying and being really pushy about it, so my husband made it clear he'd be pretty upset if I refused to go. Day of, we were running errands and lost track of time. I didn't have time to go home and change, even though I didn't feel dressed for a restaurant. My husband thought I looked fine, so I decided to STFU. Dinner was awkward, but bearable, until it came time to pay and the supervisor asked for separate checks. Wait. What? I thought he was paying! I looked to my husband for some sign that this was unexpected and saw nothing. He seemed totally fine with picking up our check. Earlier in the day, he'd told me he wanted me to wait on a purchase, because we didn't really have the money, but he could pay for a dinner neither of us wanted, when he promised it was on the supervisor?!?\n\nBut wait... I trust my husband. I know he's not a pushover and supervisor or not, he would not have just taken that hit, when he didn't even want to go to the stupid dinner. There must have been something more to this. So, I decided to STFU. When we got to car, I calmly asked \"Did we pay for that or...?\" to which my husband explained that his supervisor had given him and his coworker cash, so they could order what they liked and not have to worry about going over some limit.\n\nConsider the alternative. Instead of accepting that my husband didn't care that I wasn't dressed to impress, I throw a fit and insist on going home to change. By the time we get home, it's too late to go to dinner at all, my husband has to cancel with his supervisor, and he's pissed, because he'll never hear the end of it. Perhaps I *do* keep my mouth shut over my attire, but the check is the last straw. Instead of trusting my husband to handle it, I blurt out \"I thought he was paying,\" to which I get the same explanation, but I sound ungrateful to the man who bought us dinner and embarrass my husband and he's pissed, because he'll never hear the end of it. Instead, STFU saved the day, because *I trust my husband*, who has *earned my trust.*\n\nWhile I've outlined a daily interaction, STFU has long term applications as well. The supervisor my husband hated? I was always worried that he'd do something to get my husband fired. He was constantly pinning things on my husband and taking credit for his work. He spread rumors about everyone and bad-mouthed my husband to upper management. He kept him from getting a promotion and multiple people thought it was because he was threatened by him. I vetted well, however, and married a man who had been very successful in the oil field, something that only happens if you know how to play the game. When he'd vent, I'd occasionally ask if he'd mentioned some of these concerns to upper management and sometimes he did, but I was careful not to nag. The culture of my job is *vastly* different than his. I had to trust that he knew what he was doing, despite my fears that this idiot supervisor was going to screw him over. It's a good ol' boys' game and my husband is the best good ol' boy of them all, so I STFU.\n\nThree months ago, upper management called my husband into the office to talk about his supervisor and some issues they were having with him. My husband told them, without exaggeration or feeling, some of his problems. He left the office with a promotion to crew chief of another department, proving that my trust in him is earned... and sometimes so is my silence.","title":"STFU in Practice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/cb4xjb\/stfu_in_practice\/"}

I\u2019m 33, a quasi stay at home mom of a 3y.o and 18m.o (quasi in that I took 2 years mat leave as my job allows, I will be returning to work in Sept). Needless to say, my home can be a wild place sometimes with 2 very active toddlers running around. My life is far from perfect, I am far from perfect, and my kids are not perfectly behaved robots at all times. I\u2019ve found that being a mom can be very difficult and exhausting at times, many times by surprise. It is truly the most humbling experience I\u2019ve had to date and I know the humbling has only just begun. My general mantra is to do my best while also giving myself grace\/realistic expectations and taking each day one at a time. \n\nBut I refuse to participate in the hot mess mom thing. By \u201chot mess mom thing\u201d I\u2019m talking about:\n\n- celebrating that one is almost always apathetic towards and\/or annoyed by their children who they brought into the world while also mocking women who seem to genuinely enjoy being a mom\n\n- using \u201cI haven\u2019t showered\/put on makeup\/followed a skincare routine\/painted my nails\/shaved in 2827722 weeks\u201d as a flex while also emphasizing that moms who do this stuff must be self obsessed narcissists (most overused term nowadays imo)\n\n- living in a chaotic, dirty home with piles of stuff everywhere while also criticizing the f out of a mom with even a semi-clean, semi-organized home because surely she must spend all her time cleaning and yelling at kids to pick up after themselves!\n\n- serving one\u2019s kids a stream of nonstop processed foods while also poo pooing a mom who likes cooking and baking and does so often\n\n- shitting all over the husband, calling him an inadequate idiot while also insinuating that a woman who has a loving, happy marriage with the father or her children must be a total scam (note:  I know that not all men are stellar fathers and\/or husbands, and I am not referring to situations in which the father is a genuinely bad person, rather situations in which the loving, good natured father is blamed and chastised for the most menial errors)\n\nSo, in a nutshell, its basically the notion of being a half assed, low effort parent who hates on women who are moms and have their ish together. Nope. Not doing that. Not now, not even. Yet SOOOOOOO MANY women I know who have kids have fallen for it and subscribe to this weird ideaology. For me personally, I\u2019ve been overtly mocked for all of the above by family members (who are around my age and have kids) plus other stuff, like putting a nice outfit on my kids for holidays, cleaning their faces after a messy meal (I\u2019m being serious), and wearing decent (although not flashy, more like Gap, LL Bean, and Amazon) clothes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, I\u2019ve noticed a vast majority of said women tend to act as if they\u2019re martyrs for having kids, like they\u2019re SoOooOOooo limited, so tired, so over it because of a choice they chose for themselves and well, they just can\u2019t be bothered to put in even 50% effort anymore. Like, uh, hello? Your kids did not ask to be brought here. Yes, being a parent is a LOT OF WORK. Tons. And tons. And even more tons. But\u2026 isn\u2019t that obvious? You are literally raising a child from newborn state to be an actual person, with morals, thoughts, interests, responsibilities, etc. \n\nThis rant isn\u2019t directed at anyone who has had lots of hard days as a parent, resulting in staying in the same sweats for 3 days, unlimited screen time, multiple take out meals, and getting irrationally pissed at your husband. I believe all of those things are normal once in a while and especially in certain times of life. I myself have battled PPA, have had very rough patches with my husband, struggled to lose weight or accomplish a single 2 minute task in my house. It happens to all of us. But it seems that its become a normal, celebrated way of life and moms who are trying their damndest and being criticized as if they\u2019re not \u201cdown to earth\u201d or are toxic.\n\nDoes\u2026.. does anyone else feel this way?

Owe a lot to this subreddit so I thought to contribute once again. I\u2019ve read a lot of people\u2019s complaints about not knowing how to STFU or what that looks like, so I thought I\u2019d offer some input.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s kind of a misnomer. There\u2019re plenty of jokes about how a man just wants a mute sex doll, but reality is much more complex. Men do actually want a sentient partner who loves them for them, so some personality (and therefore speaking) is needed. The reason why STFU is so ubiquitous is that women often say the wrong things or say things in the wrong way, which is often worse than not saying anything at all. So the goal of STFU isn\u2019t to be totally mute, but to say things in the right way.\n\nSo what\u2019s the right way? There are a lot of theories, but I think it all boils down to saying what you mean. Sounds simpler than it is, because you\u2019ll have to avoid all sorts of stuff like rhetorical questions, sarcasm and hidden implications.\n\n**Example:** You\u2019re shopping with your partner and he picks a blue rug for the house, but you prefer the pink rug.\n\nWorse: *\u201cWhy would you pick that rug?\u201d*\n\nImplication: *Your choices are questionable.*\n\nWorse: *\u201cThe pink rug is better because our sofa is pink.\u201d*\n\nImplication: *I know what\u2019s best for the house. My judgment is more sound than yours.*\n\nBetter: *\u201cI like the pink rug more.\u201d*\n\nNo implications. Or maybe that you expect him to take your feelings and preferences into account, which every good partner should do (not always defer to them, but take them into account).\n\n**Example:** Your partner stayed out late at a party without you. You felt lonely and a bit insecure.\n\nWorse: *\u201cWhat were you doing so late at a party?\u201d (In an accusatory tone)*\n\nImplication: *I don\u2019t trust you.*\n\nWorse: *\u201cDon\u2019t stay out so late! You made me worry!\u201d*\n\nImplication: *Commanding, blaming. I have authority over you. You\u2019re obligated to take care of my feelings.*\n\nBetter: *\u201cI missed you! I got insecure for a bit there.\u201d*\n\nJust sharing vulnerable feelings. Insecurity is not the most attractive, but if you feel it, either own it or don\u2019t say anything (instead of trying to hide it behind logic or commands).\n\nBetter: *\u201cWould you please let me know ahead of time if you\u2019re going to stay out late?\u201d*\n\nI\u2019m requesting something because it\u2019s important to me. You don\u2019t have to grant the request but I hope you do.\n\n**Example:** Your partner isn\u2019t taking you out as often as he used to. You want to change that.\n\nWorse: *\u201cMary\u2019s boyfriend takes her out every week!\u201d*\n\nImplication: *You\u2019re worse than Mary\u2019s boyfriend. I compare you to others.*\n\nWorse: *\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take me out as much as you used to?\u201d*\n\nImplication: *I\u2019m entitled to x amounts of dates\/resources from you.*\n\nBetter: *\u201cI want to go on dates more.\u201d*\n\nAt this point, you might be seeing why having no implications is so difficult. You\u2019re in a really vulnerable position. You\u2019re communicating your authentic desires and trusting him to take these desires into account. He might not. (Maybe reconsider your relationship in that case. NOT if he can\u2019t fulfill all your desires, that\u2019s normal, but if he never or rarely takes them into account) But it\u2019s better than trying to guilt him or out-logic him into doing something.\n\nAnd yes, sometimes it is better to STFU. **Bonus real example:** In the earlier days of dating, I went to my partner\u2019s place. He bought some wine for me but didn\u2019t have a corkscrew so he was trying to open it with some tools he had lying around. It was taking a while but I didn\u2019t say anything. I wasn\u2019t going to die from not drinking immediately and I trusted that if it wasn\u2019t working, he\u2019d switch to plan B. Anyway, his sister happened to visit him at that moment, and she said all of the things:\n\n*\u201cWhy would you buy wine when you don\u2019t have a corkscrew?\u201d*\n\nImplication: *You\u2019re careless.*\n\n*\u201cHow long have you been working on that?\u201d*\n\nImplication: *I don\u2019t trust that you have time management skills or common sense.*\n\n*\u201cJust go back and buy a twist top instead.\u201d*\n\nImplication: *I don\u2019t trust your problem-solving skills.

Even if she doesn't do any if these, she makes her animosity known because she's bitter about the mere mention of *that other girl.*\n\nExhibiting these types of jealous behaviors does not work. Plain and simple. Nobody wants to be yelled at, have their privacy invaded, or deal with drama. Acting out this way can make a man think things like \"My girlfriend is extremely controlling and crazy, why am I with her?\"\n\n**Proceeding with these behaviors makes the forbidden fruit sweeter.** You're placing restrictions on what he can and cannot do. What did Simba do when Mufasa told him to never go to the shadowy land? He went to the shadowy land. What did Adam and Eve do when God said, well, yeah, you get the idea? Think about it. When you drive a wedge in and start drama, you're telling him that for whatever reason, you don't think you are good enough and you're worried the forbidden fruit is better. On top of that, that other girl, she's being flirtatious and fun. You? You are being a raging and controlling girlfriend. Now *who* is more fun to talk to right now? Definitely not you!\n\nSo what should you do? **Get in the right mindset and fight the forbidden fruit with honey.** When outside factors and temptations come at your man, it's best to remember that **he is with you, and not that other girl, for a reason, and it's best to not let him forget that either.** Instead of letting jealousy and controlling behavior to rule you, let the interaction play out, and when it's over and he's still at your side, remind him about that cute little outfit you want to try on for him at home. Straddle him on his lap so he can't put the phone in his face and give him some sugar. If you're a pro, you can even get away with saying things like \"Oh, she's cute.\" While making advances. \n\n**It works because it reinforces that you have something the forbidden fruit doesn't.** She may be batting her pretty little eyelashes at your friend's social function, but no matter how cute she thinks she is, you're the one who knows how to blow his mind in the bedroom at night. You know his favorite dish, you know exactly where that sore spot on his neck that he likes rubbed is, and you know that innocent little move you can do that drives him wild in public. You have knowledge on your side, and, well, she has eyelashes.\n\n**It works because the focus is brought back on your relationship instead of driving a wedge for the forbidden fruit to work its way in.** You're providing a positive distraction away from the forbidden fruit. When you grab his phone and go through it, or you get mad about it, you provide a negative distraction and opening the door for him to exhibit escapist behaviors, like getting angry and storming out. That gives the forbidden fruit the opportunity to slide right in. Acting this way is the easiest way to show a lack of respect and trust for your man which brings me to my third point:\n\n**He's less likely to hide his behaviors or be secretive if you are fighting the forbidden fruit with honey.** Making him feel comfortable to interact with the forbidden fruit will give you the opportunity to rate your vetting decision. A high quality man would decline her advances in a way the doesn't degrade the forbidden fruit, nor does it degrade you. Allowing the interaction to play out shows that **you trust him to make good decisions about your relationship and you respect him enough to not cause a scene.** On the flip side, if he's flirting back and acting in poor form, that's your sign that he may not be a high quality mate after all, and it's time to move on.\n\nJealousy is something that may pop up in any relationship from time to time, and handling it smartly can make or break a relationship. Instead of letting the forbidden fruit become a temptation, remember that honey is sweeter and you have it at your disposal, not to mention honey is a display of trust and respect, and bitterness is a display of the exact opposite.

The kids are 2 years and 3 months; going out can be tricky but I was eager to make it work. I packed up a couple toys for the toddler and we were on our way!\n\n10 minute wait when we arrived. This was no problem - I volunteered to take the toddler for a walk around the building and play with the shrubbery in the meantime. My dad waved me over when the table was ready, and we sat down and ordered drinks.\n\nImmediately, my eldest was squirmy. Neither the crayons provided nor the toys interested him. Two year olds are infamous for their poor emotional control, small vocabulary, and short attention span and I wasn't about to allow a meltdown in this setting. My dad suggests we go home, but I said I wanted to stay.\n\nI scribbled down both our orders and escorted the toddler outside again. It's hot enough to get sweaty pretty fast, and in 5-10 minutes he's ready to head back in and have a drink. \n\nThe food comes, and we all barely have time to take a few bites before the toddler is wanting to get down and move around again.\n\nI resign myself to taking him outside a third time.\n\nThis time I can feel the resentment creeping in. *Why isn't my husband taking him outside? Doesn't he know I'm tired\/I do so much\/I'm always with the kids\/etc.*\n\nI try to fight it off. *This meal is to celebrate him. He doesn't even like going out that much, let alone with the kids - I wanted this way more than he did.*\n\nFinally, my husband leaves the restaurant and walks over to me and our eldest, ready to take over. I beam at him, give him a kiss on the cheek, and tell him how happy I am to see him.\n\nI head back inside and tell my dad that I'm having a nice time and that I appreciate the good meal. He helps me cut my food while I nurse the baby. I feed our toddler his meal during the car ride home and make him laugh.\n\nLater that night, my husband told me he loved me. That he was proud of me. That he knew I had a tough night, but that I did it with a smile.\n\nIt was probably one of my proudest moments. \n\nThis didn't really come naturally. I had to actively fix my mindset. I had to remind myself it wasn't about me, and manage my expectations accordingly.\n\nBut I did it. And I hope I can do it more often. I've already fallen short a couple of times since, but I know the standard of behavior I want for myself. I want to handle the kids with a smile, especially when it's not coming easy. I want to make family outings enjoyable for us all. I want my husband to keep falling in love with me.\n\nI'm super grateful to RPW for all the thought-provoking posts that have encouraged positive growth in my mindset!

In this era of political correctness, being truly honest about how you feel and giving your opinions on topics that matter to you have been severely impeded because we're all afraid of offending someone. There is always *someone* who could take things the wrong way. Men *especially* need to keep their opinions to themselves. \n\nSociety has always catered to women's sensibilities (which feminists don't want to acknowledge), but now, more and more topics are becoming off limits. *If* a conversation does arise, blue pillers try to steer it in a way that aligns with the feminist agenda, and incorporate things like \"misogyny,\" \"victim blaming,\" \"fat acceptance,\" you get the picture.\n\nI gained 70+ lbs in 6 months from one of my medications (antipsychotic med). At 5'7, I used to be a healthy 145. I got up to 216 at my highest weight. This devastated me. Not only did I now have a pudgy stomach when previously it used to be flat and toned, my legs were like ham hocks, and I was covered in red, angry stretch marks. I looked in the mirror every morning and burst into tears. I felt so awful about myself that my hatred of my body combined with my self harm tendencies, and I tried to burn\/cut off my fat. That's how bad it got. \n\nThat's just on the subject of how I felt about myself. As far as physical impediments go, I now get asthma and vertigo when I try to exercise. I went to my doctor and I did prediabetic screening, and was told I needed to watch my blood pressure. I can't do even a fraction of the things I used to do anymore. \n\nI also noticed that men were looking at and approaching me less and less. It went from multiple times a day to zero within a few months. Maybe I'll get a smile here and there because I still have a pleasant face (no double chin, thank god), but still, the idea that my face is the only thing men want to look at is pretty depressing. \n\nI would try to express how I felt to my friends and immediately be shut down. It's so funny, feminists complain all the time about others invalidating their experiences, but it's something they are guilty of doing **all the time**. My friends would tell me \"You're not overweight! You're so beautiful! You don't need to change! You can be healthy at a bigger size! Men are stupid for not wanting to be with you! Don't listen to society's standards! Women don't need to look a certain way to be beautiful!\"\n\n...Yeah, I know. I know that they meant well, but all they did was invalidate my experience of being an overweight 21 year old woman who used to be healthy and attractive. They tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong when *everything* was wrong. I knew what they were saying wasn't true, but at the same time, I wanted *oh so badly* for someone to tell me I was okay. Guess what happened? None of the weight came off.\n\nEnter the man I was dating recently. We met on a dating app (not Tinder, one that's actually meant for relationships). The one full-body picture I put on my profile was from two years ago. I told myself I uploaded it because it was a nice picture (me in a cute apron holding a pie I baked), but at least part of it was because I wasn't comfortable with anyone seeing what my body looked like now. \n\nHe messages me, we hit it off, so we make plans for a date. We meet up, things seem to be fine, until we sit down to eat dinner. He says, \"you look a bit different than you did on your profile.\" I ask him what he meant. He says, \"it looks like you've gained weight.\" I get a sinking feeling in my stomach, but I tell him the truth, that I have gained a lot of weight since that one picture. He says, \"you're big, but you're pretty.\"\n\nMy mouth flew open. I had **never** had someone be so blunt with me about my weight before. (He is not American, and where he's from, it's completely okay to comment on a person's weight. I didn't know this at the time, though.)\n\nAnyway, I burst into tears in the middle of the restaurant and started packing up my things to leave. He stopped me and was very apologetic. He said that he didn't mean to hurt me, and if I'm going to be completely honest with myself, ***did he say anything that wasn't true?*** \n\nHe then sat me down and told me that he believed I had tremendous potential. He was willing to help me lose the weight. He told me he wants me to go to the gym every day, no excuses. \n\nHe is the only person who has motivated me to lose this weight, and has believed in my ability to do so. Everyone else just said that I was fine the way I was. He pushed me to improve, and he made me want to be the best version of myself. I had never met a man who has done that for me, until I met him. \n\nI dragged my feet a bit at first, but I made up my mind that I would lose a significant amount of weight when I went on vacation. \n\n**I LOST 7 POUNDS IN TWO WEEKS!** I didn't even feel like I was denying myself anything! I just cut down on carbs, loaded up on veggies, and got more active. Pretty simple, but man did it make a difference. \n\nI told my friends about how this guy was motivating me to lose weight, and you know what they said? \"Oh my god, he's an asshole, why would he ever say anything about your weight?! That's NOT okay. He should accept you for who you are.\" When I told them I lost 7 pounds, they were soooo happy for me, but of course, they didn't give him any credit for his role in my losing the weight. \n\nThe thing is, we ***don't*** want people to accept us for who we are. What if who we are is fat, lazy, unmotivated, etc.? People have the ability to change and improve, and you and your partner should always be striving to be better for yourselves and each other. \n\nWhen a man is truly honest with you and isn't trying to sugarcoat what he says, ***thank him***. It's a sign of respect. Unlike 90% of other women, he thinks you can handle it. The truth hurts, but you can turn that pain into motivation. That's what I did, and I'm not going to let anyone who thinks that he shouldn't have said anything about my weight stop me. If he hadn't, I would still be complacent and miserable. \n\nHe and I needed to go our separate ways, but his honesty changed my life, and that's no exaggeration. \n\n**Welcome a man's honesty. Embrace the truth, and move forward with your life with the newfound knowledge you have. You will be a better woman for it.**","title":"A man's honesty is a gift","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6o8i63\/a_mans_honesty_is_a_gift\/"}

Likewise, while most high-caliber men would like to date someone who is at least educated and\/or has a career, they wouldn't want to date someone who is *much* more powerful than him, as that would render his role as the provider useless.\n\nI think of it this way. I wouldn't want to date someone like [Harry Styles](https:\/\/vz.cnwimg.com\/thumbc-300x300\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/Harry-Styles.jpg), teenage heartthrob and band member.

As long as they put some minimum effort into their appearance, and aren't complete slobs, that is good enough for me, and after a point, their efforts actually work against them.\n\nLikewise, men would like women who are decently intelligent and have something going for themselves, but they wouldn't necessarily be turned-on by a CEO or doctor, who most likely will work long hours, be constantly under pressure, and have little-to-no time for a proper relationship. \n\nI don't want to date a feminized version of a man, I want to date a man. Likewise, men don't want to date a high-strung masculine version of a woman, they want to date a woman.\n","title":"Recently found out that men don't really care about a woman's accomplishments or careers for attraction, mind is blown.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9ez4ho\/recently_found_out_that_men_dont_really_care\/"}

Currently I've been working on cultivating a feminine spirit and learning to be soft and loving but I felt a bit of a mismatch with how I felt on the inside with how I felt on the outside. I wasn't a complete tom boy, I just dress like an average college student, basically a combination of leggings+hoodie+sneakers+messy bun. I spent no effort on my look and only dipping into my feminine side for events like weddings and baby showers. \n \nI prided myself for a long time being 'uncomplicated' , 'low maintenance' and 'practical' but since I've been reading here I'm realizing just how masculine my attitude was towards my appearance, those were all traits men look for in cars but not necessarily in women. \n \nI'm slowly in the process of transforming my wardrobe to be more feminine but working with pieces I already had I decided to dress up and go out just to go shopping for a bit. Earlier this week I dressed much cuter for school and when I asked one of my class mates to help me he immediately got up and came over to help me, while in the past this same classmate would have ignored me or just make me ask the professor. I wanted to experiment more with dressing feminine and see what other conclusions I could gather. So I this morning I got out of the kiddy pool and hopped right into the deep end.\n \nI put on a flirty silky polka dot top something like [this](https:\/\/awwoutfit.com\/assets\/images\/resources\/351\/700x\/cool-outfit-polka-dotts-blouse-plus-bag-plus-black-skinnies.jpg), wore a pair of skinny jeans (not feminine but working on it) that really show off my small waist and long legs, a pair of high heels, and some dainty gold hoops, a really classy somewhat conservative look but still showed my figure underneath. I have been growing my nails out and painting them soft pretty colors lately and went ahead and put on makeup (just concealer, mascara and a nice pink lipstick, all very natural but still pretty).  Most importantly I've been working on my demeanor, I have a neutral expression on my face most of the time and have been trying to smile more when people speak or make eye contact with me. I wasn't forcing myself to smile at everyone but just a natural happy peaceful look. Dressing nicely made me want to be seen so it felt easy for me to drop the resting bitch face. I felt as pleasant on the inside as I do on the outside.\n \nSo how did it go? Well at first my boyfriend asked me \"you sure you want to  go to the mall this dressed up?\" I don't really dress up for the poor guy so it was exciting for him, if anything, the one thing I learned was how much a guy appreciates being seen with someone that takes care of their appearance, he had a small sense of pride guiding me through the mall and talking to me throughout the day, even helping me off the escalator. In the past he had no reason to do so because I presented myself as capable, but suddenly wearing heels and being on moving stairs he had the desire to help me. \n \nWe went to the mall mostly for him so it wasn't like I dragged him there but  I was window shopping a bit for myself. The most noticeable thing was how many guys turned to take a second look at me, even while with their girlfriends. At first I thought maybe I dressed too out of place , but women paid no attention to me. The attention was different. At one point I saw a guy take a triple take looking at me and then his girlfriend, who was dressed in sweats and a hoodie. I think many guys enjoy the soft feminine side of women and it's seen less and less these days. \n \nThe least surprising thing is how much employees wanted to help me, every store I went into I was approached by employees asking if they could help me, especially from men. Normally when I'm in this same mall it's quite busy and if I need something I have to hunt someone down. I magically became approachable, like people were drawn to me. Afterwards I went to the grocery store to pick up dinner and I couldn't believe I was -that- woman. By that I mean the 1 random woman I see at the grocery store that's dressed up to the nines in a nice pair of heels and her hair perfectly in place. Even the cashier recognized me and immediately started a conversation while in the past wouldn't say much. I was instantly inviting. \n \nIn the past before I started reading redpillwomen I actually thought the only way Women could draw attention from men was by wearing garish colors, booty shorts, crop tops, what ever is in fashion or other overly revealing clothes, basically a forever21 clone. What I've learned is that you can't really stand out if everyone else is doing the exact thing. I never had the issue of standing out because I tend to dress in ways that hid me. But I also realized how unfair it was to myself to hide my body, I am pretty lucky that I don't have to work hard to be thin or have nice hair but my current wardrobe obscured everything about me that is feminine. \n \nMy final thoughts:\n \nI think if you are having a hard time with being approached by men this would instantly up your game, in addition to online dating. If you already have a partner then absolutely dress for them. It sounds weird but I felt like my partner respected me more for dressing up, mostly because I honored myself first by taking care of my appearance. It also made his role as the provider\/ protector more fulfilling for him and apparent. I think all in all: dress like a prize and men will always feel like they won.","title":"I tried dressing feminine for a day and this is what happened","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9k2vqz\/i_tried_dressing_feminine_for_a_day_and_this_is\/"}

I asked him what was I supposed to do.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\"\n\n\"Well, just trust me and follow me. If I lean down, lean down with me, don't struggle to remain upright. Relax and hold on to me.\"\n\nAh! That was not nothing. That was *not* nothing, I tell you. Following was hard work. But I did it, and loved it, and every time, every ride reinforced the idea in my mind - he could drive, I could follow. I could trust him with this. easy, really easy. Beautiful. Exhilarating. When we leaned down, I could enjoy the thrill, knowing that he would never let us fall.\n\n**Then, one time, we fell.**\n\nAnd I got scared.\n\nIt was my fault, really: he leaned down when I wasn't expecting it, I made a sudden movement in reaction, and down we went. Up close and personal with the asphalt. It was very gentle, for a fall, and we didn't get hurt at all. My boyfriend got up, made sure everyone was okay (first the bike, *then* me; not that I hold a grudge) and didn't mention once that it was my fault.\n\nHe asked if I'd rather go home, or if I still wanted to take the scenic mountain route he'd been planning. Let's go on, I said. Either way, I'd need to get back on the bike, and I didn't want our ride to end like this.\n\nI didn't know that \"scenic mountain route\" is almost always code for \"shitty, dirty, narrow road with no guard rail and a very pretty view on a fucking *chasm*, just in case you need a reminder of your own mortality\". Or at least that's how it seemed at the time. And of course it was too narrow to turn back, once we realized how bad it was.\n\nI didn't know how scared I'd get at every curve, tensing up, holding extra-extra-extra tight, shutting my eyes and gritting my teeth. My body, my mind, my whole being was simply convinced that we'd fall again and this time get REALLY hurt.\n\nHe pulled over after a while. I tensed up again, convinced that something was wrong with the bike.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"No, *you* tell me what's wrong.\" (he said it much more gently than I can capture here, really.)\n\n\"Nothing.\" (he was facing forward, but I can swear he rolled his eyes at this.) \"I'm just scared we're going to fall again.\"\n\nThat, again, was *not* nothing.\n\n\"I understand, but this is a difficult road. If you keep tensing up, pulling against me, trying to go the opposite direction, it makes it even more difficult. I can't drive if you don't trust me.\"\n\nI took a deep breath and signaled we could go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the back of his bike I first learned that submission could be easy and beautiful. Oh, I knew already what kind of relationship I wanted, but I'd never... *tasted* it like this. Never trusted a man so blindly, so completely. Never felt that my trust was so crucial.\n\nAnd then I learned that sometimes it would NOT be easy.\n\nSometimes the road is narrow and difficult and I'm convinced it will all go wrong. And that's when he needs my trust the most. If I only trust him when I *know* things will go well, if I only follow him when he goes in the direction I want... does it even MEAN anything?\n\nSo that's the question, really. What will I do when it gets hard? When I don't agree? When I'm scared? When we could get hurt? When I know he could mess up? When I'm *convinced* he will mess up?\n\nOhhhh if I could answer now, with certainty, that of course I will trust him and follow him. But fuck. I am human, too.

If you attempt to dump this responsibility on him, he is certainly going to wonder what else you will just demand that you should have earned. \n\n* Treating him as a means to an end. \n\nThis hardly requires explanation.

Fresh out of my college indoctrination, angry at George Bush, and fighting battles with anyone who was to the right of me, I rode on a bus with other angry college kids to protest drilling in ANWAR, and I was knee deep into the CODEPINK culture.\n\nI look back now, and I laugh. I loved that girl -- her fiery passion, her fearlessness, her desire to change the world... but MY GOD did she have it all wrong. \n\nThankfully, God, the Universe, a higher power of sorts, had a different plan for my life. When I turned 23, I met a guy -- a raging conservative -- who took each and every one of my world views and shredded them. He challenged all of my arguments and annihilated them. At first, I was lost, angry, and super confused. But as I began to learn more, read more, and understand more, I learned to appreciate this young man's frame of mind. I willingly swallowed the red pill, at least from a political perspective. \n\nWe dated for 2.5 years, but I still didn't know what I wanted in a partner. We split up, but 8 years later, I'm still friends with this man.\n\nWhile normally we discuss politics, history, or religion, we began talking relationships a few months back. We had an interesting discussion.\n\nSo, here's a little back story on me. I'm a smart, independent woman -- I have a college degree, a good job, I own a rental property, I'm almost debt free. I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I (usually) take good care of my body and I cook & clean as well. I'm positive, and I'm outgoing -- I also went through a pretty nasty break-up 2 years ago, and have really just been working on getting myself back to \"good\". \n\nI took a solid inventory of myself and what I offer in a relationship and realized the things that *I* want in a partner. In fact, I do most of them myself. I just figured, at some point, I'd find someone to mirror that... lead by example, right? \n\nBut nobody ever told me what a man would want from me. Actually, that's not entirely true.\n\nYou know who I got my advice from?\n\n\\- Magazines (Cosmo, Seventeen, Redbook)  \n\\- Hollywood (TV, Movies... Super realistic, I know)  \n\\- My girlfriends (Not men...)\n\nNever once did I sit down and ask a man what he truly thought would make a good girlfriend, partner or wife. \n\nNow, when men do tell us what they want, feminists call them misogynistic and the media tells them that they're wrong. Imagine that -- a man, being told that what he chooses for himself, is wrong... \n\nAnyway, back to our discussion. So, I asked my friend pointe blank -- what do men *actually* want in a relationship or a marriage.\n\nHe said, \"Men are simple. We want a girl that lets us lead. This doesn't mean she's a doormat, but she doesn't try to take control of every situation. We want her to take care of her body. Ideally, she'd be younger, but there are some young girls that are flat out idiots (look at you when I met you, he said. Haha). There's good physical chemistry, she knows how to communicate and resolve conflicts. If she can make me feel good about who I am physically and mentally (and she can cook, he added) she's worth my time.\"\n\nInteresting. We talked a little more. Basically, none of my accolades mattered to him (except the cooking part. Ha). \n\nHe said being debt free is a bonus, but he makes decent money, so some student debt was okay. He said major credit card debt was a red flag. He said it was nice that I owned property, but so does he -- and he wouldn't live in a girl's place anyway. He said college degrees are nice, but not necessary. He said keep learning and keep working out. A sexy mind and a sexy body do wonders for women.\n\n*Then he asked me why I was trying to be a man.*\n\nI was taken aback by his question. He said, \"All of the things you do, you are essentially your own provider. Where does that leave room for a man in your life?\"\n\nI had honestly never looked at it that way. I always thought that I'd find a good partner because I embodied things that I wanted in a partner -- but it turns out that I've actually become my own worst enemy because, well, he's right. I don't technically need a man, even though I'd really like one.\n\nHis words struck a chord -- and although my sample size is quite small (yes, a whopping 1) I think there's a lot of truth in what he said. \n\nHere's what's interesting... I'm not the only woman who's living like this. The woman who, although she's feminine, has adopted a lot of \"masculine\" traits. Who believes and supports TRP philosophy, but is still living in a very BP world. \n\nBut nobody ever told me what men really want. Who knew you had to go to the source?!\n\nI started taking his advice a few months ago and have been poring over TRP, RPWomen and other books, blogs and articles for answers. \n\nNow that I know what my biggest obstacle is (myself) I can work on healthy ways to make a man feel needed and appreciated. \n\nIt's time we start adding men back into the conversation about their wants and needs, and not trying to dictate that for them. I'm glad that this group exists because it's providing much-needed insight to the male mind and how we, as women, can be better partners.","title":"Nobody Ever Told Me...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/97v1w1\/nobody_ever_told_me\/"}

While all three groups of women have pretty different ideals, we all have a pretty deep fear of becoming the Practice Wife. It\u2019s the woman who spends YEARS, maybe even a decade or more, with a man waiting for him to propose or commit. To her, she\u2019s put in a lot of investment into shaping this man into Husband Material \u2122. For whatever reason, the pair breaks up, and lo and behold, the guy is engaged to his new girlfriend after only being with her for a year or less.\n\n\u201cI knew it! That scumbag was just using me all along,\u201d she huffs. \u201cI was his Practice Wife that he used to get all the benefits of a relationship without giving anything back, all while practicing how to ACTUALLY be a good partner for someone else. Now some other b*tch\/whore\/slut\/whatever-other-insult-you-got gets to reap all the rewards of all the work I did to make him into a better man! Men are trash, never trust a man, don\u2019t even THINK about doing a single thing for him until you have a ring on your finger, yadda yadda yadda...\u201d\n\nWhile I completely understand and sympathize with these women\u2019s anger and hurt, I also think they\u2019re missing a BIG point of what happened and how they can prevent themselves from ending up in this situation again. They\u2019re also unknowingly misleading the young and impressionable women they tell their cautionary tale to. There\u2019s something they need to accept about THEMSELVES, not just this \u201cevil\u201d man who \u201cbetrayed\u201d them, before they can actually move on successfully or give helpful advice.\n\n__\n\nTo explain, let\u2019s first review a [basic and fundamental part of RPW theory](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/wiki\/index\/tableofcontents\/trpvsrpw?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf): **Women are the gatekeepers of sex, while men are the gatekeepers of commitment.** While I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all heard this at some point here at RPW, it\u2019s worth diving into again.\n\nWhy are we the gatekeepers of sex? I could go into the vast evolutionary biology and psychology behind it, or I could give you real-life examples of how it plays out, but I think you already have an idea why. *On average, men desire sex MUCH more than women do.* Sex is more like a need to be satiated for men, like hunger or thirst. What starts out as a small rumbling ~~in their loins~~ in the back of their heads slowly becomes so all-encompassing that they can\u2019t do much else until they satiate that need by any means necessary (means that they often regret once [Post Nut Clarity](http:\/\/images3.memedroid.com\/images\/UPLOADED623\/5a2aafd56a867.jpeg) hits). \n\nWhile women also enjoy sex a lot and plenty of women (including myself) have high sex drives, the majority of healthy women aren\u2019t seeking out sexual fulfillment in this way. Sex for women is tied to many other things like love, commitment, comfort, and safety. With all these pre-conditions, it\u2019s not exactly the highest priority on our totem pole.\n\nThis situation creates an unbalanced power dynamic. The men need sex from us far more than we want sex from them. When we take rape and brute force off the table, *women are the ones who have more leverage and ultimately get to decide the terms of when sex happens.*\n**This means that men have to work to INSPIRE us to want to have sex with them.**\n\n__\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the opposite side. Why are men the gatekeepers of commitment? Again, the proof is in the pudding for evolutionary biology and psychology, as well as in real life, but I think we as women struggle with this concept more than the previous one. Try to think of it the same way we thought about sex: *on average, women desire commitment MUCH more than men do.*\n\nRemember that totem pole where sex fell somewhere in the middle for us? Commitment is at the very top for healthy, well-adjusted women. While we needed a committed man\u2019s utmost protection and provisions for our very survival in the past, I\u2019ve [argued](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ohgjcr\/men_dont_need_women_and_thats_wonderful\/h4rvfwp\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;amp;context=3) that we still need a bit of that today. For the naysayers who insist we don\u2019t need men at all in the modern world, can you at least admit that those urges for commitment are still evolutionarily coded into our mating strategy? Why does nearly every little girl daydream and fantasize about her wedding and happily ever after, after all?\n\nWhile men also enjoy commitment (when it\u2019s not degraded and poisoned by our modern world\u2019s conditions) and while it\u2019s also one part of their dual mating strategy to commit long-term, it simply isn\u2019t the priority for a majority of men, especially in our current times. One part of this is because sex has always fallen much higher on their totem pole than commitment, but the more uncomfortable truth is that men aren\u2019t reaping a fraction of the benefits they used to from commitment and marriage, for significantly higher costs and risks. As a result of the declining quantity and quality of commitment-worthy women, some men have opted to prioritize sex alone, even if they\u2019re the ones who prefer commitment deep down. Others are quite cautious and guarded with who they give their commitment to.\n\nAgain, this situation creates an unbalanced power dynamic. We need commitment from men far more than men want commitment from us. Because of this, *men are the ones who have more leverage and ultimately get to decide the terms of when commitment happens.*\n**This means that we have to work to INSPIRE men to want to commit to us.**\n\n__\n\nPhew. Okay. So we know this and we don\u2019t debate this. It\u2019s an idea central to all RPW and TRP theory. What I\u2019m here to try and convince you of is that **Practice Wives are ultimately responsible for their own misfortune because they failed their main job in their relationship strategy: to inspire commitment from their man.** Both the Practice Wife and the \u201cb\\*tch\/slut\/whore\u201d he proposed\/committed to to were dealt the same hand when it comes to the power dynamics of sex and commitment. And yet, the b\\*tch\/whore\/slut\u2019s girl game was tight enough to secure that man\u2019s commitment, while Practice Wife\u2019s girl game wasn\u2019t. The man didn\u2019t commit to the so-called Practice Wife because she didn\u2019t inspire further commitment, not because he was using her for practice for someone better. Evidently, they broke up for a reason.\n\nTo take this one layer deeper, **this also means that the Practice Wife isn\u2019t real.** She\u2019s a scarecrow that scorned women create to 1) protect their own egos 2) shift the blame from themselves to the men who didn\u2019t want to commit to them 3) refuse to have any agency or accountability for their outcomes. By hiding behind this scarecrow and not addressing the mistakes that got her here, these women are only doing a disservice to themselves (and anyone naive enough to listen to them).\n\nSo 1) stop protecting your ego. Be brutally honest with yourself about your SMV\/RMV, and accept that it was too low to inspire commitment from the man you desired. 2) Stop shifting the blame. You cannot control how much other people suck or how they choose to treat you. You **can** know which men to vet for and which men are more likely to commit , and you **can** learn exactly what inspires the vast majority of men to commit. With the knowledge that you\u2019re at fault comes the power to change it. 3) Stop seeing yourself as a victim AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Improve your SMV\/RMV, vet and pick the right men for you, and become the feminine, sweet, submissive, and nurturing woman that men crave so badly. \n\nIf you can\u2019t beat the \u201cb*tch\/whore\/slut\u201d who got what you wanted, then join her, take a page or two out of her book, and use some of her girl game. Luckily for you, there\u2019s tons of resources here at RPW that shows you how to do just that. So if you ever find yourself stepping into the Practice Wife\u2019s hay-filled shoes, stop making a straw-manned victim out of yourself and take the accountability needed to become better.\n\n**TLDR**: There\u2019s no such thing as a Practice Wife, only women who failed to inspire commitment in the men they\u2019re dating. Stop hiding behind this false myth and do something to change your own odds for the better.\n\n__\n\nThis was inspired by a comment thread I had a long while ago with u\/Whisper where he explained that there\u2019s no such thing as a Practice Wife because men don\u2019t work like that, as well as the recent discussion u\/MirriMazDuur sparked about why men don\u2019t need women.

It looks a little something like this:\n\n*Men think women want:* \n\n1) handsome men so good-looking that he\u2019s considered [prettier](https:\/\/blenderartists.org\/uploads\/default\/original\/4X\/f\/4\/1\/f41de2f8d860585cecd01e3da831893e1b327068.png) than most\n\n2) [nice guys](https:\/\/img.cinemablend.com\/filter:scale\/quill\/4\/6\/8\/6\/8\/a\/46868a94df2f2645c9e099539777a3419b9d911d.jpg?mw=600) who are sweet and endearing \n\n3) neck-to-toe [hairless](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/1f\/41\/b9\/1f41b9a5277030b5e82321eae0f545d9.jpg) bodies\n\n4) a luscious, [full head of hair](https:\/\/static.onecms.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/14\/2020\/01\/09\/010920-timothee-chalamet-lead-2000.jpg)\n\n5) [sensitive](https:\/\/academichelp.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/sensitive-man.jpg) men\n\n6) [peaceful men](https:\/\/thumbs.dreamstime.com\/b\/peaceful-man-meditating-isolated-over-white-doing-yoga-background-34030635.jpg)\n\n\n**Women think men want:**\n\n1) women who are [hard to get](https:\/\/ilovemylsi.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hard-to-get.jpg)\n\n2) [tall](https:\/\/i.insider.com\/60f54cd27095a8001862e3ef?width=700) women who tower in heels\n\n3) [confident](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/32\/cc\/82\/32cc82cd70a5a4f839274133ee59ddc2.jpg) women\n\n4) [badass](https:\/\/www.inkedmag.com\/.image\/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620\/MTU5MDMyNDQyOTkxMDkzNTI4\/sock.jpg) women\n\n5) [successful](https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/4b40a096b7ad7e229932d5255fbfb96dda78f419\/0_192_3173_1904\/master\/3173.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=e9e93fbfb6c71e9b9ada16482a5e9363) women\n\n6) [tough](https:\/\/media.glamour.com\/photos\/56959b6c93ef4b09520d7003\/master\/pass\/inspired-2015-05-max-max-fury-road-charlize-main.jpg) women who aren\u2019t afraid to get down and dirty\n\nNow, that\u2019s not to say that the things on these lists are straight up unattractive to the opposite gender. Women still like handsome men, and there are some exceptions who dig the whole soft, sensitive type of man. Men still like women who are tall, and some exceptions like whole successful, boss bitch thing. But this is RPW, where we talk about generalities that apply to most, not exceptions. We also need to recognize that while some of the sexes\u2019 expectations are reflected SOMEWHERE in the opposite sex\u2019s desires, they are nowhere NEAR the *priorities* for what the vast majority of men and women actually want. \n\nStill struggling with the concept? Think about it this way: how turned on were you by the sensitive dude with a flower or the skinny hairless guy with a pretty face? That\u2019s how men feel about Oprah or Charlize Theron in Mad Max, at least for LTRs.\n\nInstead, consider these lists reversed:\n\n**Women actually want:**\n\n1) men who are hard to get (or at least highly covetous and desired by many) - just think of every male lead for female stories like Christian Grey from 50 Shades of Gray or Mr. Big from Sex and the City\n\n2) tall men - \u2018nuff said.\n\n3) confident men - aka men who will be confident in their ability to lead us\n\n4) badass men - in pure fantasyland with no responsibilities, a significant chunk of women daydream about bad boys or at the very least hyper-masculine men\n\n5) successful men - again look at how many women want a Christian Grey or Mr. Big type\n\n6) tough men who can get down and dirty - it just does something for our instincts to gravitate to men who can protect and provide\n\n**Men actually want:** \n\n1) physically attractive women - ya know, men are visual creatures and all that jazz\n\n2) nice women who are sweet and endearing - a feminine personality has gone a long way for the women here!\n\n3) neck-to-toe hairless bodies - it amps up the sexual dimorphism between us and the hairier sex\n\n4) a luscious, full head of long hair - more evolutionary psychology for ya: it shows youth, fertility, and health\n\n5) sensitive women - we\u2019ve talked at large here on how vulnerability triggers his protective instincts\n\n6) peaceful women - we\u2019ve also talked about being a soft place to land and how it will keep your relationship strong\n\nSo to the newbies: stop trying to self-project your own desires onto the opposite sex. It would work SO much more in your favor as a sexual strategy to use the reversed lists. Some of us do and to great results. It may also help your understanding of why being \u201chard to get\u201d ultimately does nothing to boost his attraction to you, or why you shouldn\u2019t be dating the sensitive nice guy if you\u2019re having doubts. Finally, knowing that many people tend to self-project, listen to what they say they want in a partner as an indication of how THEY want to be treated if it sounds a bit nonsensical or suspect.\n\nAgain, highly recommend that Rules Revisited post - it\u2019s much more eloquently stated and goes a bit deeper into the trappings of self-projection.

Their answer to \"I slept with a lot of men\" is \"begone harlot!\", which isn't very useful, because \"you shouldn't have done that\" isn't advice, it's just moralizing. \n\nOkay, the bad news is that because of what you did, you absolutely are less desirable as a wife. Take a deep breath, look in the mirror, and accept that, because getting mad or sad about it does no good. You are not a jar of peanut butter, you can't get *unscrewed*. \n\nAlso useless is blaming men for caring about such things. Men weren't put on this earth to serve you. They get to like what they like and they don't have to answer to you for whether it's \"justified\" or not. \n\nThe important place to start with is to understand *why* men care about your sexual past. \n\nThis may be difficult because **men themselves usually do not know why they care about your sexual past**. They don't understand their own feelings in this area, and so they cannot explain them. They only know that it \"bothers them\". So they make up excuses like the ridiculous \"stretched out\" myth, as if girl parts could somehow wear out, and did so faster with more partners. Or they say that women who have lots of partners can't pair bond, when it's actually the reverse (women who can't pair bond have lots of partners). \n\nThey're not *trying* to lie to you. They just don't *know* why they are turned off by the idea of committing to a woman who's been with lots of other men... and they are trying to explain it themselves. \n\nBut it *can* be understood. The key word here is \"committing\". If you look at porn targeted towards men (not the written-word stuff targeted at women), then you notice that the women in it are just about as slutty as it's possible to be, and it doesn't turn the male audience off at all (otherwise they wouldn't be depicted that way). \n\nMen don't care about the sexual past of their casual sex partners, but they care deeply about the sexual past of their romantic partners. This is because they know, even if they can't articulate it, that a woman is at her most sexually available and adventurous with the man she loves the most.\n\n**What actually bothers men is the idea of being with someone, of committing to someone, for whom he wasn't the top choice.** A man can be patient with a girl who is a virgin... so what if she made him wait for a week, or a month, or whatever? After all, she made everyone else wait for eternity. She's still being at her most sexually available with him in particular. \n\nBut once a girl has, for example, a one-night stand, then that indicates something about what it takes to inspire her sexual enthusiasm, and if she she tries to put the brakes on with future partners, this tells them exactly where they stand in the scheme of things. This is why men find the news that his wife had a previous one night stand to be humiliating... she desired that other man more than she desired him. \n\nAnd it's no good to say \"I made a mistake\" or \"I changed my standards\" because all that means is \"other men were able to tempt me to do unwise things, but I have more self-control with you\". \n\nSo, that's the problem with sleeping with a man you just met... because forever afterwards, that's the standard. That's the benchmark. Anything more reserved than that means \"I'm just not that into you\". And you will never persuade a man otherwise by talking at him. \n\nSo, with all this being understood, what can you do? \n\nThere are three approaches: \n\n1. Lie. This may seem immoral, but we don't do moralizing here. Lies can, theoretically, fix the problem. But there are some drawbacks. You can't ever be totally open and honest in your relationship... you have to live that lie for as long as your relationship lasts. Also, if you ever get caught, a lie compounds the injury, and you should not expect the relationship to survive. \n\n2. Continue to take sexual risks, but with a purpose. This involves being as sexually available to the men you're dating now as you ever were in the past, although now you are at least *looking* for a relationship. Obviously, this tend to expand your sexual history even further, but at least if you manage to get something going, you didn't withhold from him *more* than you did with others. \n\n3. Radical self-improvement. Increase your value on the sexual marketplace so much that you are not the same sexual partner at all, and it's obvious that you can command more effort and investment. This is not as simple as just learning to play the piano, or being slightly nicer to men. It has to be a profound and immediately obvious improvement to the point where a man would not he made ashamed. Think on the order of quitting your drug habit, losing fifty pounds, maybe getting a nose job, and basically reinventing yourself. If you could be in a room with a former sexual partner and your husband, and the FIRST guy feels like a loser, because he had a much worse version of you, that's the magnitude we are talking about. \n\nWhat do all of these solutions have in common? Well, they all hurt. They all have drawbacks. \n\nBut this is the real world, and it wasn't put here to be fulfill your fantasies. This is simply damage control. \n\nIt may be tempting to think that you can re-invent yourself as a virgin and simply raise your standards. We've seen plenty of women try to do this, and some of them even find partners. But what they do not find is *enthusiastic partners who had other choices*. Men who wife up an slut are men who don't have options, and there will reasons why they don't have those options. \n\nSo if you want the best partner that is available to you, you're going to have to have a concrete strategy for dealing with what you did, and how that affects their feelings, instead of just complaints about the consequences of your actions. That means more risk, and more compromises... but we can always play the cards we have to the best of our abilities.","title":"So what if you've had a lot of partners?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/j3mlf4\/so_what_if_youve_had_a_lot_of_partners\/"}

I see it time and time again, and you're all terrible shit at this.\n\nThere's a reason. Guys rationalize bad decisions and past decisions as \"preferences.\"  I won't dig up the quote right now, but Rollo made a very good point to this theme: Guys will have a preference for whatever worked before. If nerdy chicks show interest in a guy, he will gain a preference for nerdy chicks.\n\nThis isn't because nerdy chicks are necessarily sexier or more feminine, but because guys come from an essentially needy position. A position of no abundance.\n\nOn TRP we focus on abundance mentality to try to subvert this natural disadvantage, but it's true. Guys will never, ever, have as many options as women.\n\nSo when I hear a guy tell a woman, \"No, you keep doing what you're doing, I like a woman with a little spunk..\"\n\nThis guy doesn't have a preference for \"spunk.\" No, he's an idiot who is so thirsty he'll take any woman he can get, and he'll accept her self-proclaimed handicaps as features. \n\nHe'll think to himself, \"gosh, she's bitchy, rude, and abrasive..... well, I like a strong independent woman.\"\n\nAnd that's his rationalization. Because he's a thirsty fucking idiot.\n\nBut when they start preaching about their preferences as though it's going to be useful advice for women, then we've got a problem.\n\nAnd we do have this problem here. Guys think they know what good advice for women is.\n\nWomen, if you take this advice- \"i find book smarts to be very attractive\" I promise you will waste a considerable amount of time and energy doing something that doesn't really boost your SMV. Oh sure, some guys might say they have the preference, but ultimately, book smarts aren't actually sufficient to create attraction, nor required for said attraction to exist. Guys will not assist you in actual SMV building. Because, guys want to fuck you anyway, and will basically accept you as you are. But that doesn't help your chances with higher quality guys.\n\nIf you're a dude, and you think you should be chiming in, read the fucking side bar. Then read it again. Then *don't* chime in. Because it's unlikely you've got much to contribute.\n\nIf you're a guy and you contribute and it's not gender neutral (that is, none of that \"as a guy...\" bullshit), then it's out of here, and you're out of here.

Where I will ramble about the foundations of this sub, what we are and are not and how we can use these tactics to achieve our goals. Class meets whenever I feel inclined to write and you can find the syllabus in the back of the book \u2013 by which I mean my head, good luck getting it out[.](https:\/\/lizfortoday.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/1950_1.jpg) \n\n***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###By any other name...\n\nSubmission is one of the foundational ideas of RPW and it is a *very difficult* concept to understand for new members. People come into RPW all the time thinking that we are doormats who will bend over backwards and let a man do anything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe background that you bring to RPW will influence your view of submission. A Christian will have learned that she [submits to her husband out of reverence to her faith](https:\/\/www.focusonthefamily.com\/family-qa\/submission-of-wives-to-husbands\/). A BDSM sub will anticipate [a firm spanking]( https:\/\/theprincessfantasy.com\/blogs\/news\/the-ultimate-guide-to-domestic-discipline-improving-your-relationship) if she steps out of line. The majority, will stand in the middle and look at each end of this spectrum and think: \u201cwhere the heck do I fit in?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHypergamy leads us to seek out the best man we can find. When we say \u201cwomen date across and up\u201d this means we are attracted to men who are better than us *in some way*. He might be stronger, he might be smarter, have a better job or socially higher status. We are attracted to the confidence in these men. They make us feel safe, protected and cherished. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is fitting because men want to feel competent in their lives and in their relationships. Men often ask themselves [if they measure up]( https:\/\/redd.it\/8f6upu). Rather than being protected and loved, men wish to feel [respected and admired](https:\/\/redd.it\/8cnh7l). Submission at heart, is the way we behave to show men the respect and admiration that they crave. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut the *word* submission is a sticking point for many. If your modern Western brain struggles with the word *submission*, consider instead *deference*.  We defer to others on a regular basis: to bosses at work, to teachers in school, to those with more knowledge and experiences than we have or those who take on responsibilities we do not want. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhatever word you use to describe the practice, it does not mean you need to be less than what you are. You defer to a professor because they have more knowledge than you, not because you are stupid. You defer to the manager because they have more authority and responsibility than you, not because you are incapable. You defer to your partner because you love him, not because you can't function on your own. You need not be weak so another can be strong. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nA doormat is a woman who will make herself weak to assuage the ego of a weak man. Submission is a tactic that anyone can use, and it *can* be used this way. Any man will appreciate being shown respect (remember: [it is how they love]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8zvaif\/i_love_him_but\/)). The person you are harming is yourself. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nInstead, find the best man you can. A man whose vision for the future aligns with your own. A man you respect. If you don\u2019t *want* to follow his lead then he\u2019s not the right man. If you think his plans are terrible then he\u2019s not the right man.  If your life goals are at odds then he\u2019s not the right man. If he asks you to set yourself on fire because he's chilly, *then he's not the right man.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChoices should be made that are in the best interest of the family and the relationship. Do not quit your job that you love because he wants to be the sole provider. Quit your job because you both believe it is the best way to raise children. Do not STFU when your husband is about to make a wrong turn because you fear embarrassing him (*seriously Laura Doyle, wtf*). STFU because mowing the lawn is his responsibility and you trust him to manage his own to-do list.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer that most women are happier with a man than without a man. I do not believe that women are better off with *any* man. Do not blindly follow a weak man. The risk to your own self worth and the relationship are great. (I know a woman who got herself a stress fracture tolerating a weak husband). Do not make yourself into a foot stool so he can kick back and relax --- unless you are into that sort of thing. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSubmission - trusting his judgement, deferring to his knowledge, following his vision - is what you do to demonstrate that you respect a respectable man. If you show him love in the way he desires it, he will cherish you all the more.","title":"Doormat vs Deference","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/diasdc\/doormat_vs_deference\/"}

However, recently I have decided put in more of an intentional and conscious effort to feel (and hopefully become) more put together.\n\nY'all.....making this move has literally changed my life in a few short weeks. And I'm not talking about a complete overhaul. I'm talking small and reasonable changes with the wardrobe and products I already owned.\n\nTucking my shirts into my jeans for waist emphasis. Cuffing the jeans for a fun and femme touch. Wearing strappy sandals instead of bummy flip flops. Even better, wearing flats. Updating my glasses to be cute but classy. Taking better care of my skin.

Wild.\n\nHowever, I had a virtual interview about a week ago. I wore a simple gray cardigan and black t-shirt style dress, and I literally got the job over another person with a similar work history and education because the employer said they could tell that I took myself seriously by how I presented myself. They talked to me about how they've been interviewing people who show up for their Zoom calls in pajamas. For interviews. What?? I went in today for my physical and HR stuff, and I was approached by all kinds of higher ups throughout the facility who congratulated me on my new position with the group. These are people that I have seen all over town before who never gave me a second thought who are now giving me their cards and telling me that if I'm ever in their building, feel free to stop by.\n\nMaybe it's a placebo effect of feeling better because of looking better.

Who here wants to *lead* the relationship? \n\nLove changes over time. In the beginning, infatuation is a fire and it\u2019s all consuming. These feelings fade as a relationship becomes comfortable. Love deepens and is a shared bond that can sustain you for life. That love requires you to think highly of the man you love. It goes beyond hormones and passion. \n\nThat love is also easily confused with habit and attachment when a relationship is on the line. \n\nOften I see \u201cI love him very much\u201d along with a list of his faults. What that really means is: \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable in this relationship and I don\u2019t want to start over\u201d. \n\nYou can care deeply about someone and not respect them. If you do not respect a man the relationship isn\u2019t sustainable. So instead of attempting to identify \u201clove\u201d for a man, ask yourself if you respect him. Does your gut tell you that you would follow him into a fire? Forgo your path to join him on his? Will you proudly show off your relationship to friends and family without omission? Do you think he knows where he\u2019s going in life and will you stay by his side through thick and thin? \n\nLove isn\u2019t enough. There *must* also be respect for the relationship to survive.\n","title":"I love him but...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8zvaif\/i_love_him_but\/"}

All of your advice was extremely helpful, and I did it that week. \n\nFirst thing to set up: I\u2019ve been following Red Pill for about 5 years now. It\u2019s essentially one of the defining parts of my personality. I\u2019m naturally soft spoken, I don\u2019t swear unless I\u2019m quoting something (I actually stopped doing this when I was still in high school). My roommate\u2019s summary is that I\u2019m very kind, but I also hold onto my beliefs very firmly, and I don\u2019t mind having a different opinion (not going to lie, this one meant a lot to me)!\n\nOne of the first big disagreements with the last guy I dated is that he wanted me to be a bit more wild. It bothered him that I didn\u2019t curse, and he wished that I would drink more (I just really hate the feeling of being drunk, so two drinks is generally my limit). That one ended up with me crying, haha. \n\nTime Jump: Present Day\n\nI\u2019ve recently started dating a new guy. He\u2019s the same age as me, but he is a lot more mature. We have very similar views on religion (we met at church), drinking, chastity, etc. He\u2019s definitely still more aggressive than I am, but in a nice, balancing way. \n\nLast night, we were talking and he told me that one of the things he likes the most about me is that it feels natural to treat me like a lady. To the point that his brother (who\u2019s also his roommate, so I see him fairly regularly since we all tend to hang out together) has the same impulse. \n\nIt\u2019s just nice to be liked for who I am, and that I don\u2019t need to compromise my values. Obviously, it\u2019s still early days in this new dating situation, so anything could happen. This has just been a pleasant reminder for me, and I wanted to share.

However, the vast majority of these women are married to well-to-do men who belong to the high income bracket. They constantly flaunt their beautiful and expensive clothes and luxury purses, all while praising their hubbies for their new gifts. It is nice they give credit to their husbands but I\u2019m just turned off by excess and materialism in general. It makes me wonder if they would be sweet and submissive if their husbands didn\u2019t earn as much and couldn\u2019t give them their lavish lifestyle.\n\nAs a Christian, I see things from a spiritual perspective and I strive to honor and respect my fianc\u00e9 both because I believe God commands me to and also because I genuinely love him. I would love him the same if tomorrow he got a job making 500,000 a year and also the same if he suddenly lost his job and we were struggling.

Those two things are damaging to the soul in my opinion, and as much as modern women dislike being seen as \u201cobjects\u201d... this is exactly how many of them view men- precisely as tools only meant to give them the life they want.\n\nHope this doesn\u2019t come across as judgmental or bitter because it isn\u2019t my intention at all.

I apologize because I\u2019m not very familiar with posting on Reddit and I\u2019m on mobile so I have no idea how to link the original post to this one, but it is fairly recent. When my husband got home from work that day, (after I gave him a minute to unwind and eat dinner) I brought up my concern about him sending me these pictures. I made sure not to get emotional about it or come off as accusatory, but I also stood my ground and did not back away from the conversation when he tried to say he was just joking. As a reminder, we are still fairly  young (24f and 25m) and we\u2019re just married a few months ago, although we have been dating for over 6 years. I expressed my feelings and asked him to be open with me about any areas that he is wanting me to improve in and I clearly stated that he is being hurtful by sending me these pictures and communicating in that way. I also told him that now that I have fully expressed how it made me feel, I will take any continuation of this behavior as being intentionally hurtful and would not tolerate it. We had a good talk about it. He tends to shy away from having talks like this but I made sure to convey how important this was to me and I feel that he listened and took it to heart. He told me he would stop and that he did not realize how much it affected me, and he has not sent me anymore pictures of other women, just our normal memes and silly stuff. I think part of the problem is that I am very meek by nature and have a hard time setting boundaries. As I said in the previous post, we are very happy in our relationship and I am so in love with my husband! This was one of the very few behaviors that was causing me stress. We talk a lot about STFU here, which is very important and still a necessary skill to improve on, however I think this was one of those rare occasions that calls for speaking your mind. I know it\u2019s a little silly to be happy that he has not sent me pictures for a couple of days but I trust his promise and I\u2019m so happy that I was completely frank and honest about how it made me feel. I appreciated the support in the comments and especially appreciated those who encouraged me to dig deeper into the problem and consider his point of view before letting my emotions get the better of me! This little experience has emphasized to me that you can be a traditional or submissive wife and still expect respect from your husband, and in fact those two need to go hand in hand . It is ok to hold your significant other to certain standards. I almost feel embarrassed that I did not fully express my hurt sooner than this, as if he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle my concern appropriately. Anyways, just wanted to update you on the progress and encourage any other meek RPW\u2019s that might have the same mindset as me!","title":"A little update for you: \u201cmy husband sends me Instagram models daily\u201d","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/nxunye\/a_little_update_for_you_my_husband_sends_me\/"}

I suspect most readers here have a less promiscuous background than I do. However, it's something I think most of the US is blue-pilled on, and I certainly was until I allowed myself to think these somewhat unorthodox thoughts - so maybe the folks in this forum will understand. Sorry it's long.\n\nI probably had my first orgasm at around 12 years old using a jacuzzi jet. I was reading a romance novel in the bathtub and discovered it. Since then, I've always been able to easily make myself orgasm.\n\nFast forward to my first sexual encounters with men: growing up in a modern, liberal-minded society all my male partners ALWAYS went down on me and wanted to make sure I orgasmed every time. At first, I liked it. I thought it was great that they wanted to make sure I orgasmed just like they did.\n\nBut as I got older, I realized the part of sex I enjoyed the most was the intimacy of penetration. I didn't orgasm in sex most of the time but I loved it more than I liked orgasming. You feel so intimate and close with another human.\n\nMen would continue to insist on \"making me cum\" but I did it to please them. It made them feel better about themselves if they could go down on me and give me an orgasm. I didn't really care if they did, but they'd be disappointed in themselves if they couldn't make me orgasm so I always let them. Then they'd feel satisfied that they made me climax. What they did not realize was that it was the (non-orgasmic) sex that pleased me so much more than the mechanical clitoral orgasm. I might as well use a vibrator as have a man's head between my legs - it's so impersonal, mechanical, detached.\n\nLove is the part of sex that I love. Orgasm is just a physiological response.\n\nI tried to google it and see if anyone else was having these thoughts. Mostly I found articles about how it's okay if you can't orgasm, sex can still be just as good. But these words - \"just as good\" - were troubling. I think sex can be BETTER when we don't fixate on female orgasms. I can orgasm just fine. I prefer not to.\n\nAnd it makes me wonder if we've actually made sex worse for women by focusing so much on the orgasm aspect of sex - men see the orgasm as the central goal of sex - and so they want us to experience it too and get obsessed with making us orgasm - when in fact, it is the intimacy and closeness part of sex that is really more enjoyable for most women when we aren't fixated on making sure we orgasm.\n\nAnyway, you are an open minded bunch so I was curious to hear your thoughts.","title":"controversial thoughts on the female orgasm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/wm9hjn\/controversial_thoughts_on_the_female_orgasm\/"}

I took a leap of faith and started stripping. Financially it was very liberating. However, during my year long stint in stripping, I  ran through difficult thoughts and emotions. \n\n\\- I struggled with how my physical beauty and youth was HEAVILY tied to my worth in the eyes of men at the club. If I were to get seriously injured or age out in the industry, my conventional beauty would dissipate, and so would my income. \n\n\\- I struggled in knowing that wealth and power is truly what makes a man attractive for attention in the club.

Looking back I was coming to terms with The Wall, and the gender roles in gatekeeping. \n\nThese realizations had shattered my  BluePill perception of equality between women and men.

I had no inkling that sex could actually be that meaningless to them. \n\nNot only does a woman not have to be \u201camazing\u201d for a man to want to sleep with her; she doesn\u2019t even have to be attractive. All she really needs to be is NOT hideous and interested. Men have nothing to lose by sleeping with women. The higher their n counts, the better they\u2019re viewed (opposite for us of course). Some will even sleep with a girl just to raise his count. It\u2019s absolutely *nothing* personal.\n\nI know that not all men and women are the same and that this quote doesn\u2019t fit certain people. It\u2019s just something I\u2019ve noticed heavily since I\u2019ve come to this realization.\n","title":"\u201cWomen sleep with who they want.

In fact, when given the choice, men would rather feel unloved than inadequate and disrespected**. \n\nThe Author begins by describing a relationship retreat that she attended as a young adult. To demonstrate men and women\u2019s relationship needs, they did a quick \u201cexperiment\u201d. After putting all the men on one side of the room and all the women on the other the following question was asked: \u201cIf you **had** to choose, would you rather feel **alone and unloved** or **inadequate and disrespected**?\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019ve spent some time on RPW you can probably see where this is going. \n\nThe majority of women said they would never want to feel alone and unloved (to the surprise of the men). **The men, on the other than, overwhelmingly preferred to be alone and unloved as long as they did not feel inadequate or disrespected**. The women in the group were just as surprised by this information and rightly so. Without being told otherwise, we all innately expect the opposite sex to share our perceptions of the relationship. \n\n\nRespect for men is so critical that 3 out of 4 would prefer to go their entire lives feeling unloved than disrespected.\n\n**The Author\u2019s lightbulb moment comes when she realizes that a man equates the respect and love. With this in mind, we can see that for a man feeling disrespected is no different than feeling unloved.**\n\n&nbsp;\n \nIf we want to love our guys in a way that *matters to them*  we need to respect them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn just the way that we want to be loved unconditionally, even when we are miserable, sick, pmsing, cranky, you name it; men need respect to be unconditional. This might mean respecting him and trusting him even if you don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s meeting your expectations. It is very common for us (as a culture) to believe that love is supposed to be unconditional but respect is something you must earn. For your man, love **is** respect. If you love him unconditionally, then you must respect him just as unconditionally or he won\u2019t feel it. \n\nRemember, we give what we receive. **A man who is unconditionally respected by his SO will in turn, show her unconditional love**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Disrespect and your Man\n\nWomen cry when they feel unloved and alone. This is our natural reaction. How many fights have you had with a man where you felt terrible and cried? Now, how many fights have you had with a man where he gets angry and blows up? \n\nMen express the pain of disrespect through anger. In the heat of the moment, none of us are good at articulating our feelings. A man is unlikely to say \u201cyou disrespected me and I do not appreciate that\u201d. Instead, he feels the pain and humiliation of your disrespect and it expresses itself as anger. \n\n*Think about that the next time he gets angry. That anger is the same thing as your tears. It is a likely a response to something you did or said that made him feel disrespected (and remember, respect is male for love).*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### How are we messing up? \n\nNo matter how many times we say: \u201cI love you\u201d as long as we continuing trying to control things men **will** interpret it as disrespect and mistrust. \n\nIf we keep the mentality that \u2018respect is earned\u2019 then we are putting the onus on him to be amazing. Remember, we chose our men because we vet well and start out thinking they are amazing. Hold on to the respect that you felt early in your relationship. Do this because **choosing to trust, appreciate, admire and believe in him is choosing respect and respect is a choice we make.** \n\nBut if you don\u2019t respect him? \n\nIt\u2019s possible that you are you caught in *The Crazy Cycle*. This happens when the man doesn\u2019t give enough love, so the woman doesn\u2019t feel love and treats him with distrust and as undeserving of respect, he in turn feels slighted and then doesn\u2019t give love. If you choose respect and *behave as though your respect him* him it breaks the cycle. \n\nBut how can I respect him if I don\u2019t feel respect?  \n\nWe do this by understanding that feelings follow words and actions rather than the other way around. If you disaparage him all the time, then you will begin to feel contemptuous of him. This is simply the way our brains are wired.  The decision to show respect can easily turn to actual feeling of respect. And you must demonstrate it. It\u2019s not real to a man unless you show it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###In practice\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSaying to him: \u201cI respect you\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same impact as him saying to you \u201cI love you\u201d. Instead, te needs to hear things like:  \u201choney I\u2019m so proud of you\u201d, \u201cI trust you\u201d, and \u201cthank you for what you did\u201d. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are six areas where men need to be shown respect. \n\n**Respect his judgement** This means respecting his knowledge, opinions, and decisions. You show this by not questioning his knowledge or argueing with his decisions. Defer to him. Many men expressed that their coworkers trust their judgement more than their wives do. Men wish they could tell their wives to show more trust in their decision making abilities\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Respect his abilities** Men need to figure things out for themselves. They have a drive to conquer the world in big and small ways. This might be as simple as conquering the handyman fixes around the house. If a man sets a task for himself and we try to help, he will most likely  interpret it as a sign of our distrust in him. You must have confidence that he can learn and do these things. \n\nThe age old example of asking for directions explains this problem. Telling him to ask for directions is interpreted as telling him you don't trust him to figure it out himself. Maybe you don\u2019t but let him figure it out. \n**Forcing ourselves to trust him in little things is a big deal to a man. The little demonstrations of respect are signs of our overall trust in him**. \n\nAnd when it comes to giving advice, we must remember that he is the one up to bat and it is his competency on the line. Giving advice can get *very* close to telling him how to do it and *that* sends the message that we don\u2019t believe in him or his abilities. When you want to give advice, try instead to tell him simply: \u201cI know you can do it!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Respect what he accomplishes** It is important for a man that he does something, does it well, and **someone notices**. In a survey conducted by the author, she realized that while girls ask themselves \u201cAm I special, am I loveable?\u201d boys ask themselves \u201cDo I measure up? Am I any good at what I do?\u201d \n\n**Men needed to feel noticed, able, and appreciated for what they do externally.** This means saying things like:  \u201cYou did well at that meeting\u201d or  \u201cyou are such a great dad\u201d Both of these sentiments can be better than \u201cI love you\u201d. \n\nAn important side note here is the issue of \u201cThank you ...but\u201d. This is painful for a man to hear. You may not intend it this way but to him it sounds like \u2018you failed\u2019 If your man has expressed that \u201cnothing I do is ever good enough for you\u201d Then you\u2019ve been sending the message \u201cyou tried and failed\u201d). \n\n**Always tell him you are proud of him.**\n \n&nbsp;\n\n**Respect in communication** As women we have the power to build our men up or tear them down. Some things we do will push buttons or be very painful even if that isn\u2019t our intent. What we say matters but so does how and where we say things. \n\nYou may say: \u201cI want to fix this thing in the house, but you aren\u2019t a fix it guy, we should hire someone\u201d He will hear: \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, you are inadequate\u201d. \n\nSometimes men will hear disappointment in the things we say. They will read negativity into reminders about chores and tasks, or worse they will hear accusations of laziness and mistrust. Inherent in the reminder is a statement of disappointment, it\u2019s the implication that they failed. \nOther times they will hearing attacks. The author crafted a  survey question:  \u201cDo you know how to put together a romantic event that your SO would enjoy\u201d This comes across as attack mode because it starts off by suggesting the man is inept. Instead she rephrases the question as \u201cSuppose you had to plan an anniversary event for your partner, do you know how\u201d. This is better because it doesn\u2019t question his adequacy and abilities.\n\n\n**Remember, It doesn\u2019t matter what we\u2019re saying, it matters what he hears. Most men are highly sensitive to disrespect including seeing it where we never intend We need to adjust to their sensitivities just as we\u2019d expect them to adjust to ours. It is important to love your partner in the way they need to be loved.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Respect in public**  Never criticize, put down or question your man\u2019s judgement in front of others. Often what we women consider light teasing is actually torment to men. Women sometimes feel that they need to take their man\u2019s ego down a notch. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. We do not have to take down their egos because their egos are incredibly fragile. What is at stake in these situations is not his overabundance of pride but rather his secret feelings of inadequacy. Public disrespect is painful and men will avoid it at any cost. **Some single men told the author that public disrespect is a sufficient red flag to cause a break up**. No man wants to live with public disrespect, teasing or criticism for the rest of his life. What we think of as good natured teasing isn't good natured from his perspective. \n\nThe author relays a discussion with her father. Here is what he told her: : \u201ca man might take wrong any sort of teasing that shows that he is not in control or doesn\u2019t have the respect of his wife. Men wouldn\u2019t take this from another man at all, so it is not appropriate for his wife to tease him in this way either. The man is the provider and protector and a woman\u2019s teasing tells others that she believes that her husband doesn\u2019t know how to take care of everything.\u201d He also tells her that \u201cIt depends on if a guy is already feeling inadequate in a particular area.\u201d What one man mind brush off, another will find painful *if he\u2019s already questioning himself in that arena*. \u201cIt is far worse to be teased in front of other men. Guys are in competition and your wife knows you better than anyone. If your wife, who knows you best, doesn\u2019t respect you then why should other men. It\u2019s a sign of weakness if you don\u2019t know the other man well. It\u2019s also humiliating because the other man will feel sorry for you that your wife doesn\u2019t respect you\u201d. They point out that belittling your husband in front of other men can even derail his career because other men will see him as weak and not worthy of respect. \n\nIn addition to how this negative talk makes them men feel when they are present, it causes problems for us even when our men are not in the room. Talking negatively behind you man\u2019s r back is both public (even though he\u2019s not there) and impacts our own feelings. Because, once again, feelings follow speech and action,  if you talk poorly about your man, you can start to feel dissatisfied with the relationship. \n\n**If you publicly build your man up, he\u2019ll think you are amazing. Do this with honest praise and soliciting help in front of others.** Tell stories that show him in a good light. From what the men say, this is equivalent to a dozen roses and a surprise night out without kids. He will feel adored.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Respect in our assumptions** Take some time and listen to your own assumptions. You may not realize how often your assumptions come from a place of negativity or distrust.: Some examples: a. We assume that ge needs to be reminded (Honey, have you done X yet?). When we do this we are assuming he\u2019s forgetful or he *needs* to be prodded(nagging anyone?). Instead assume the best of him: \u201c*I asked him to do it and he hasn\u2019t done it, but I trust him so there must be a reason he hasn\u2019t done it.* Just because  his reason is different from yours doesn\u2019t make it less legitimate, his priorities may be different and that\u2019s ok. b.  We assume that he\u2019s *choosing* not to help. Instead start with the assumption that he doesn't\u2019 see that help is needed, rather than that he sees and ignores it. Give your SO the benefit of the doubt, he likely has good intentions. c. We assign unloving motives to him. This is a problem because we know now that our words and action impact his well being and feelings of love towards us. Consider first that perhaps, it is something you did or said that pushed him into the issue. A woman who is always nagging may push her husband to withdraw and become unloving (which is really reaction to disrespect). \n\n&nbsp;\n***\nWe hold power and responsibility and opportunity to build up or tear down our men. We can strengthen or hobble them. Respect at home affects every area of his life. If he feels competent at home he\u2019ll be powerful in the world. \n\nYou can always **choose** to be respectful. Don\u2019t ignore problems, but find things to appreciate and applaud regardless. Focus on what is good and worthy of praise. \n\nMen are forgiving once wives and girlfriends suddenly \u2018get it\u2019. Apologize if you\u2019ve been disrespectful. And most importantly, when you apologize: don\u2019t say  *I\u2019m sorry I made you feel this way*. Instead say:  *I\u2019m really sorry I said that, it was disrespectful and I know I can trust you.*\n\n**Remember, behind every man is a good woman - if a man\u2019s wife supports and believes in him, he can conquer the world.** \n","title":"'For Women Only' - Respect and Love - Chapter 2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8cnh7l\/for_women_only_respect_and_love_chapter_2\/"}

But many women's immediate reaction to the very idea is *\"I do not want to approach men.\"* There are a number of reasons for this, some good, some bad, which tend to boil down to this list:\n\n* I don't want to look so starved for male attention that I *have to* chase men. \n* I don't want to look like a slut. \n* Men don't like to be approached. They want to do it... right? \n* I don't want a man who isn't bold enough to make the first move. \n* My ego requires that men do all the work. \n* It's men's natural role to approach, not mine. \n* Approaching is scary. \n* Uh... I don't know how. \n\nMost, if not all of these are based on single misconception. \n\n**Approaching or making advances doesn't just mean making a male-style overt pass.**\n\n**It means any way of starting an interaction that can lead to something.**\n\nWhen a man approaches a woman, the effective way to do that demonstrates masculine virtues: courage, decisiveness, assertiveness, leadership skills, and so forth. \n\nWhen a woman hears: *\"You can approach men, go ahead! It's fine! Men like it!\"*, she often thinks of that particular process and either cringes in horror at the thought of acting like that, or naively forges ahead, and chats up dudes as if she were one... at which point they eye her as one would a crazy person or a rabid dog, and start edging away. \n\nThere are feminine ways to begin an interaction. \n\nThe first tier of this is *signalling willingness to be approached*. This is mostly done with eye contact, and many women already understand it. \n\nMake eye contact deliberately. Hold for a few seconds. Smile. Break eye contact by dropping the eyes *down*, not looking away. Repeat. Turn toward him, displaying open body posture. Laugh at lot. Play with your hair. \n\n... this isn't hard stuff. Most every girl knows how to do this. \n\nThe rarer skill, which we'll focus on here, is being able to *actually open the conversation*. There are several elements here:\n\n* You must fabricate an excuse to talk to him. \n* This excuse must *be* an excuse, and not your overt reason. \n* This excuse must not be too good... in fact, it should be pretty bad.  \n* You must continue to fabricate bad excuses to give flirtation time to happen. \n\nThe point here is that you are using [indirect speech](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3-son3EJTrU). \n\n**He must be aware of your real intent**, and he must think that it is about **him in particular**, not that any man will do, or that you want attention. \n\nIf you use an overt reason (\"I find you attractive\") rather than an excuse (\"Can you help me with this homework problem?\"), then you have broken the delicate surface tension between *\"Looks like she's really into me\"*, and *\"This is weird, why is she acting weird? Is she crazy?\"*. Then you look desperate, or like a slut, or neurotic, or whatever explanation he comes up with for your bizarre behaviour. \n\nHowever, if your excuse is *too good*, then he either believes it, or is unsure whether or not it is an excuse. Both are bad. If he believes it, he will focus on the ostensible \"purpose\" of the interaction, miss any attempts at flirtation you make, and probably leave when the fake task is accomplished. If, for example, he really believes that you just need help with that one homework problem, he'll either focus on math, and leave when you seem to get it, or he'll decline (because he's not your unpaid tutor, and has things to do). \n\nWhere most women err here is *excuse too subtle*. They are often afraid of being too blatant or obvious, and not always aware that *men do not speak to each other is subtleties*. \n\nThere is **no such thing as an excuse that's too bad**, so long as it is an excuse and not an actual direct statement that you want to continue talking to him because you find him attractive. Remember that he's supposed to see through it, and that's its fine if others see through it as well. This can't be stressed enough. Men often miss what you think of as glaringly obvious, because men do not typically talk to each other that way. If it feels about right, it's too subtle. If it feels embarrassingly obvious, it's probably about right.  \n\nOnce the conversation begins, and your bad excuses allow it to continue, flirtation has time to happen. If logistics intervene, a bad excuse can be made to resume contact in the future. \n\n\n\n\n","title":"Approaching Men: the Art of the Bad Excuse.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/7ad6eb\/approaching_men_the_art_of_the_bad_excuse\/"}

This will also make sure that you never end up being the \"crazy\" girlfriend or make too much damage to your relationships. \n\n.\n\n\n2) PATIENCE & BEINGNESS \n\nThis is very important as give a man the space to chase you and win you over. This increases both your feminine energy and his masculine energy, and it will stop you from obsessing over when a man is going to call you. Really, it's important for your sanity. \n\n.\n\n\n3) RECEIVING & APPRECIATION \n\nThis is very important to inspire a man to keep taking action to pursue you, spoil you and to adore you. When you can clearly show him that he makes you happier with his actions (still, you are responsible for you own baseline happiness,\u00a0 his action are extra), you incentivise him to keep doing it, as he will feel more like a success (in pleasing you) when you show him your \"pleasure\". \n\n.\n\n\n4) LISTENING, BEING QUIET & HOLDING SPACE FOR OTHERS \n\nThis is a very loving skill to have and it's basically \"holding\" other people's heart, by letting them express their excitement and passion with out interrupting them. I also call it listen with your heart, and people feel so loved and you learn another about that person.\n\n.\n\n\n5) DUCT TAPE = STOP CRITICIZING OTHER PEOPLE \n\nWhen ever you feel like giving unsolicited advice or just to comment on other people's behavior DON'T! It does do anything good for you nor your relation and frankly, it's disrespectful and condescending (even though that is not your intention). Stop criticizing and nagging other people. (Use boundaries instead and stay calm and firm.)\n\n.\n\n\n6) ENCOURAGEMENT & SUPPORT \n\nThe feminine role in a traditional relationship is very much to be the supporter and help mate of your husband. Practicing this skill with anyone you love lifts them up when they are down, and it's an important skill to develop especially for your (future) family's mental health. \n\n.\n\n\n7) PLAYFULNESS & BRINGING LIGHT \n\nThis is one of the more untangable, alluring and very attractive skills feminine women must develop. Being the godess of light and fun as Laura Doyle would say. Be FUN to be around! Not in a joking kind of way, but in a childlike, adorable, innocent* and silly manner - be girly, bring out your inner girl (- of course don't be immature by acting like this in the wrong situations.) \n\n.\n\n\n8) AGENCY & RESPONSIBILITY \n\nA feminine woman never sees her self as powerless or a victim. She knows she knows she has agency to change her life and always look on how she can improve her self or other aspects of her life. \n\n.\n\n\nWhat other personal skills do you ladies find important to develop as a feminine lady? \n\n.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you want more details I have made a video on this topic and I hope you might find my video useful and my channel interesting \ud83d\udc96 \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb https:\/\/youtu.be\/zqxIEfsuUNY \n\nI hope to help more women find and embrace their true inner feminine self \ud83c\udf38 \n\nMy channel is in its essence about being free to be feminine! I focus on Femininity, Happiness, and Transformation. If you want to become more feminine, then this is the right place to be \ud83c\udf38 (I will speak up against feminists and feminism as well) \n\n\ud83c\udf38 you are welcome to take a look if these topics interest you \ud83d\ude0a \ud83c\udf38 \n\nPS.

I don't want to ever nag him or try to change his mind, and always want to just be truly honest and genuine. I believe that this is how I can show my husband true respect, and it feels as though everything is so much simpler.\n\nHere are a couple of recent examples -\n\nA few times a year since having children, we always have some tension around visiting my family. While they are polite to eachother, my husband doesn't really get on with much of my family (particularly my mum). Because of this, he understandably doesn't often want to go and visit them. With young children I don't feel confident doing the journey and visit alone, and he doesn't want me to either.\n \nUsually I would keep going on about how much I want to visit, how we can make it work etc. But this time when he asked about visiting soon, I simply said something along the lines of \"I would really love to visit my family for the family gathering. If you think it would be possible with your work schedule and we can go, there is no obligation for you to join in with seeing everyone. If you don't think it will work, then I understand\". I truly meant it (no manipulation), and I left it at that.\n\nHe looked at how best to do things, and we are going (with no disagreements) which I'm really pleased about. When I thanked him; he told me that he will do the visit as he knows it will make me happy, but if he feels obliged to do something, it steals the joy of giving for him. I completely understand him.\n\nThe second example is about our children's bath time. Because of my husband's shift work - sometimes I bathe them, and other days he does. I wanted to do something a bit different in our routine, and where in the past I would have tried to convince my husband to do it the same as me, instead I simply just said \"I'm going to do bath time with the girls like this, because of this reason. I don't mind if when you do bath time you do it differently\". And again, I meant it. No hidden meaning.\n\nHe had obviously thought about it, and agrees with me about the change. This wasn't my intention, but I think just respecting him enough to let him decide how he wants to do things actually opened him up to re-evaluating how we do things.\n\nI know that this is so simple and obvious to many people, but it's definitely something that I have had to learn. I'm looking forward to always continuing with this genuine and pure communication, with no hidden meanings or agenda.","title":"No nagging is true respect","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/cjvw0p\/no_nagging_is_true_respect\/"}

I let him take the lead, bore him two babies back to back, cooked him gourmet meals twice a day, offered him blow jobs every day, tried every fantasy he had, everything. He was always low libido which made me sad but I figured it was stress and tried to just be a better wife.\n\nAfter the birth of our second baby and a fair amount of sexual rejection, I\u2019m ashamed to admit I looked at his history and found regular porn use stretching back years. I estimated he\u2019d seen 1000 or more naked women in the time since he\u2019d last shown interest in seeing me naked. I was super crushed and hormonal, he felt terrible and after a couple attempts stopped using it, and our sex life improved and is now pretty great, as long as he focuses on just kissing and emotional connection because physically I\u2019m covered with loose skin and stretch marks from pregnancy and he\u2019s admitted it\u2019s a turnoff. I\u2019ve lost all the weight and toned up my body and had a huge glow up - frankly I look hot as hell with clothes on - but nothing I can do will make me look like the tight teenagers that turned him on naked. And even if some surgery could achieve this, what would happen when I start to age? I\u2019m 29 now.\n\nI reread Fascinating Womanhood and Laura Doyle and more and I tried really hard to just be confident and feel sexy so he\u2019ll think I\u2019m sexy, etc but every time we have sex and he avoids looking at our touching the majority of my body and he closes his eyes and I wonder who he\u2019s thinking about I feel used and cold toward him. I find my attention leaving him and I find myself more interested in other people and life outside my family because it hurts too much to be home with him. I was so devoted to him and our children, family, home, legacy - I sacrificed my body, career, and more and am left with less sexual value. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I feel cheated by the RPW approach. It resonated with me and felt so right, but I mistakenly thought my devotion would be enough to keep him smitten with me forever.","title":"Feeling betrayed by RedPillWomen.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/190bpyv\/feeling_betrayed_by_redpillwomen\/"}

Identifying prior toxic patterns in your relationships if necessary and recalibrating your picker.\n\n- Confidence - Writing down and setting personal boundaries\/dealbreakers and trusting yourself and gut to follow through. Be willing to walk away when disrespected.\n\n- Availability - Making room for a new man in your life by sending right signals. This includes clearing out\/limiting interactions with exes, orbiters, and politely declining invitations from pursuers you\u2019re not interested in instead of leading them on. Getting rid of behavior where you hide that you want a relationship. Dating incompatible men in effort to change them.\n\n- Assertiveness - Understanding that RP submission is not equivalent to being a doormat and should be given gradually, according to how the man responds. Understanding \u201cfeeling bad\u201d or having a meal bought for you or excusing a man\u2019s disrespectful behavior as \u201che\u2019s just a RP man\u201d is not good reason to have sex with him. If you feel pressured to do anything, it\u2019s a red flag, no matter how much chemistry you feel. The only good reason to have sex is when you have commitment (not just the status, but commitment preferably through time) and when you feel ready.\n\n- Sensuality - Being in touch with your own body, loving your own body and feeling sexy. Knowing what makes you feel good. Especially so if you\u2019re a conservative woman so you don\u2019t end up starfishing when you meet Prince Charming. Treating yourself to spas, luxurious body scrubs, bath and wine, and whatever makes you feel sexy.\n\n- Resillience - \u201chope for the best, expect the worst\u201d mindset. Accept that there are still risks at the end of the day and that you can do everything right, but still have things not work out.\n\nEdit: I wrote this list not to say \u201cdon\u2019t date because [insinuating] you are not good enough\u201d but more of this list is to say \u201cthis is the best position a RP woman can be in to empower herself in a feminine way and attract someone of higher value.\u201d Also, this list is taken from reading this forum inside out and putting it together.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t have your shit together, you\u2019re more likely to be desperate and put up with abusive relationships or fall for men who disrespect you\/lie to you\/use you as a plate but tell you otherwise. \n\nHaving your shit together is most importantly, FOR YOU.

We respect ourselves and are not automatically entitled to the universe without putting in the work. We put in the work and strive to be the best women possible, single or no. Obviously we have flaws, trauma, baggage, but we deal with them and make as little excuses as possible. If we have a captain, we know ourselves well enough to ask for help.

I was familiar with the person, but until recently, not the name... until    \n[Guywithgirlwithabike](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Guywithgirlwithabike\/) was kind enough to tell me (they've known each other for years)! Now, without further ado, I would like to introduce you to Dylan Thundercock.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLike his brother Chad, Dylan is very handsome... but unlike big bro, he seems so humble, not arrogant at all! He's even a little bit nerdy... he loves all the Lord of the Rings movies and he even cosplayed as Aragorn at the Ren Faire (teehee!). He was just totally shocked at how many women he was able to get out of their chemises by the end of the afternoon.\n\nBut Dylan doesn't *judge* them. In fact, whenever Chad calls women whores and sluts, Dylan is always quick to chide him and come to their defense. You see, Dylan is a feminist. He will never, ever think ill of a woman for having a high n-count (actually, he's not even familiar with that term, outside the realm of biostatistics, of course). He thinks women should be free to explore their sexuality with whomever and however they wish. Some of his closest friends are strippers... ahem, *sex workers*. He feels really bad for all those oppressed handmaidens, kept down by the cruel patriarchy, who will never know the liberating bliss of getting pounded by Dylan in his tent at Burning Man.\n\nDylan doesn't sleep around... he's polyamorous. He can't get it up for any woman with whom he doesn't have a deep emotional connection. I know you just met him, here at this dive bar where he just finished playing a set, but with one glance, Dylan can see into your soul. Don't you want to explore this inexplicably intense bond that you two share? Oh, he's moving too fast? That's OK, he'll wait until you're comfortable, when the stars align and the time is right. In the meantime, he's going home with Alexandra. Oh, you're jealous? He never imagined you could be so controlling; he thought you were so kind-hearted and open-minded! Why are you trying to *shame* Dylan, just because he has so much love to give?! \n\nDylan listens intently and sympathetically as you malign your husband or your boyfriend. It's so terrible that your man doesn't immediately respond to your text messages when he's at work, while Dylan is always responding right away... even when Alexandra is right next to him in bed. Ah, Alexandra... she's such a strong, confident woman... so unlike all these hysterical, backward-thinking little girls with oppressive expectations of monogamy. \n\nDylan will always be supportive of your dreams. He hasn't missed a *single one* of your burlesque performances! And isn't it great how, unlike Chad (who only dates cheerleaders and Victoria Secret models), he doesn't have these societally-manufactured expectations of beauty? Dylan loves women of all shapes and sizes... so long as they are bent over the hood of his classic Mustang.\n\nOf course, Dylan would never ask you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. He knows your happiness is the most important thing in the world, after all. But wasn't it Mother Theresa who said that suffering brings us closer to God? With that in mind, won't you try anal, just this once?","title":"Introducing Chad Thundercock's Younger Brother, Dylan -- A Lady's Man for Our Modern Age","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/cgv0tj\/introducing_chad_thundercocks_younger_brother\/"}

I am following a gym routine of 4 days a week weight lifting, some cardio and basic yoga. Meditating 5 minutes a day which is basic but building up. Started taking multi vitamins and collagen and I look forward to taking Omega 3 ( i live in England so there is minimal sunlight for my daily requirement of vitamin d - I do the best I can with my food so using these as supplementation).

I am unrecognisable to those who knew me at 16. I was unhappy, chubby, masculine and lonely! Now I am happier, fitter, more feminine and still occasionally lonely.

This love for him made you blind to his faults and his love for you made him blind to your faults. Things flowed smoothly, you didn't have to put it much effort to be head over heels, completely infatuated with each other. \n\nBut that didn't last forever. It's impossible for that to last forever. Sooner or later, you begin to notice flaws, annoying quirks and <gasp> shit that stinks \ud83d\ude33\n\nSuddenly you're bickering, arguing and quarreling. Ugh. Can't you just be infatuated again?\n\nNo. You can't. That ship sailed and it's time for a more mature love. A love that's more in sync with day to day life and less in sync with fantastical romance novels. \n\nOkay, cool. But wait a minute. Why didn't we get divorced as soon as the infatuation ended and the bickering began? What exactly kept us together?\n\nCommitment kept us together. We were so committed to each other, we just **had to** try harder. We just **could not** give up so fast. \n\nIn other words: commitment truly kicks in, when the love fades away. In fact, commitment isn't ever necessary when the love is strong. Commitment is only necessary because love is constantly shifting and changing. Commitment is meant to keep the union together, even during the lowest, darkest times, when hardly any love can be felt at all. Whatever love is present, is hiding somewhere deep inside. \n\nCommitment (in marriage) is inspired by love. Commitment itself, is not love. They are separate concepts. \n\n**Love** draws us towards each other. It's an emotion that has us **wanting** to come closer. There are many variations of love, but the common denominator in all variations, is: **being drawn closer together**. Love of parents and children, love of siblings, love of friends and love of spouses. Each is the desire to be closer, each in the way that is appropriate for that type of relationship. \n\n**Commitment** is when you stick to something or someone, even **when you have zero interest!** This is how you can be committed to a job, a project, to the hospital, to an insane asylum or to jail. You may have no interest at all, but you are committed. \n\n**Devotion** is when you are super committed. When you invest that extra degree of effort and energy. When you run the extra mile. This is impossible to do when you're not really interested. You can be committed without active interest, but you cannot be devoted without active interest.\n\nHave you ever reached a point in your marriage where you're constantly bickering and\/or cold and\/or sexless and\/or loveless and\/or can't stand each other?\n\nI'm embarrassed to admit that I have been there, done that, got the t-shirt and the bill\u2026..\ud83d\ude25\n\nBut here's a lesson from my grandmother:\n\n> If you want him to run that extra mile for you, you have to give him something bright to look forward to at the end of that mile. \n\nUgh\u2026 so simple and not so simple, all in one\u2026. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAfter much conversation, discussion and clarification, she was essentially suggesting that I **act** loving, sweet and pleasant to him, even if I don't **feel** that way.

It was termed as healthy by my classmates and even my sex Ed teacher. If I had a crystal ball I would go back and explain the damage I was doing to both myself and by reinforcing a toxic exploitive industry, I do however believe a minor shouldn't have access to something as addictive as porn which is another conversation I guess\n\n. Over the years my relationship with porn and masturbation became more and more worrying, I was using porn as a way to numb and dampen down every emotion I had and to escape the sadness and misery I was experiencing. This type of emotional numbing led me to develop severe anxiety as I suppressed what was natural and embraced this muted, hollowed out existence. I'm not writing this to garner sympathy but to explain that the level of emotional suppression I was engaging meant I couldn't be a functional partner to anyone. Women who I dated and liked I could never be intimate with, I actually felt awkward and overwhelmed just by a woman touching me.\n\nThe severe intimacy issues brought on by porn and unresolved traumas that porn allowed me to escape meant that I was so disassociated on dates seemingly incapable of developing a healthy bond with a woman, leaving them questioning themselves both personally and sexually(when I obviously couldn't perform or seemed disinterested in physical touch with the wonderful woman in front of me)\n\nI am 7 months clean now with little to no improvement in my symptoms except severe depression and emotional under regulation due to years of repressed emotions, I have also disqualified myself from the dating pool as no one should have to deal with not being physically affirmed or having to babysit a broken man while they navigate mistakes of their own doing. If a man mentions to you that they watch porn I would urge you to cut ties, no good will come from entertaining the broken soul in front of you. Even if they are good people they won't be able to give themselves over to a healthy relationship and its best you move on and try to find someone who can. \n\nAgain I apologise for invading your space and am truly sorry that you have to deal with the men of this generation. You deserve attentive, loving partners for which porn has robbed you of undeservedly\n\nEdit: A few people rightly pointing out the lack of clarity around the non improvement of symptoms. Performance wise I have no problems now, not that I'm actively exploring that until I'm in a better place mentally. The \"symptoms\" I'm referring to are the dealing with the emotions I suppressed and left unprocessed for so long.

Unless you and your SO have *incredibly* mismatched libidos, it\u2019s a safe bet that your man wants more sex. What we don\u2019t often realize, is how strongly a man feels this need or why. This chapter explores just how important sex is to men and more importantly **what sex means for men and why it is so important**. \n\nThe author was unsurprised to find an *urgent theme* that arose from her surveys: men want more sex. What she discovered when men opened up more is that men believe that women don\u2019t understand that this need is a crisis for both the man and the relationship. \n\nWomen who understand that men need sex, tend to view it as a physical need. It is not hard to come to terms with that idea. What we miss is how much emotion men attach to sex. **Though there is certainly a physical component, sex fills a powerful emotional need**. And, because men don\u2019t describe sexual needs in emotional terms, we often don\u2019t realize it. **The lack of sex is as emotionally serious to him as his sudden silence would be to us. It is just as wounding and just as much a legitimate grievance.** \n\nRemember all the previous chapters where we talked about men\u2019s insecurity, feelings of inadequacy, the burden they feel? A man can feel isolated and burdened by these feelings that he never discusses. Sex assures him that he is desirable. It eases the loneliness and allows him to face the world with confidence. He cannot feel completely loved without it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*In his heart, he wants to be wanted.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo explore this idea further, the author asks the following survey question\n\n> Q: Regarding sex: with some men it is sufficient to be sexually gratified whenever he wants, for others it is also important to feel sexually wanted and desired by your wife. *How important to you is it to feel wanted by your wife?* \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe question gets to the nature of sex. If it is the act itself, then men should be happy as long as they are receiving as much sex as they want. However, less than 1% claimed that feeling wanted was irrelevant as long as he got enough sex and only 2% said that it wasn\u2019t very important to feel wanted. A full 66% said it was very important and an additional 31% said that it was somewhat important. **For most men, the sex act alone is insufficient**.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that we women are intentionally withholding something that we know is critical to our partner\u2019s well being. What is more likely is that women don\u2019t realize the emotional consequences of our responses, or lack of them. We perceive the desire for sex as a physical desire or if we\u2019re being cranky and unkind, an insensitive demand. For the sake of our relationships, it\u2019s important to understand the truth behind our men\u2019s advances.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Why is sex so important?\n\nIn the surveys two trends emerge. The first considers the benefits of fulfilling sex and the second the hindrance that rejection creates. \n\nAcross the board, men reported that having regular mutually enjoyed sex life was critical to their feeling of being loved and desired. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> I wish that my wife understood that making a priority of meeting my intimacy needs is the loudest and clearest way she can say *\u201cyou are more important to me than anything else in the world\u201d*. It is a form of communication that speaks more forcefully with less room for misinterpretation than any other.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany men, even those with close friendships, seem to live with a deep sense of loneliness that is foreign to us women. Making love is a balm for that loneliness. It means there is one other person in this world he can be completely vulnerable with and not judged. \n\nFulfilling sex gives him confidence. As we touched on in \u2018imposter\u2019 chapter, most men ask themselves \u201cdo I measure up\u201d. Our support and affirmations help our men to feel confident of their place in the world. Sex is just an extension of this idea. Your desire is a bedrock form of support that helps him face his daily life with confidence and wellbeing. Men are more confident and alive when their sex life is active and rewarding. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Q: imagine your wife was an interested and motivated sexual partner and you therefore had an active love life, how would having sex with her as often as you wanted, affect your emotional state? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAbout a quarter of the men surveyed (23%) said that sex is unrelated to emotions or how he felt about the rest of his life. For these men sex on demand would have little to no impact on his life. However, the remainder, a full 77% said that it would have a positive effect and that he\u2019d have a greater sense of well being and satisfaction with life. Ask yourself, what is the likelihood that my man is in the minority? \n\nMen tell us this all the time, but again, because they don\u2019t speak in emotional terms, we *hear* the man code for this fact but we don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s actually saying. When he says he feels better when he has more sex, it\u2019s easy to assume that he means it in a purely physical way. This is wrong, men repeatedly tell the author. They feel better and life feels better when they are getting enough active and mutually appealing sex. Put simply, it helps release life\u2019s pressures and makes everything *feel* better.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###What happens when he doesn\u2019t get it?\n\n> If she doesn't want to, I feel incredible rejection. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMost men would rather do onerous tasks than have sex with a woman who is responding out of duty. The guy isn\u2019t going to be rejected by his chores whereas duty sex feels like a rejection. \n\nIf you are responding because you have to, he knows it, and feels the sting of rejection. Remember that what he wants most is to be desired. If you agree to roll around in bed, but once you get there, you aren't engaged, he isn\u2019t going to view it as something you do out of love.  He hears *\u201cYou are incapable of turning me on even if you try and what is most important to you, isn\u2019t important to me\u201d.* If you flat out reject him with say, the standard: *I\u2019m tired honey*,  he hears *\u201cYou re so undesirable, you can\u2019t even compete with my pillow, and I don\u2019t care about what matters deeply to you\u201d.* \n\n**None of us *mean* this of course. It doesn\u2019t always matter what we mean, what he hears and feels are the pill that must be swallowed here**.  We may just be saying *I don\u2019t want sex at this moment\u201d*, but he hears that you don\u2019t want him and that is painful. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Men Speak: \n\n> She doesn\u2019t understand that I feel loved by sexual caressing and if she doesn\u2019t want to, I feel incredible rejection.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> \u201cNo\u201d is not no to sex, as she may feel, it is no to me as I am and I am vulnerable as I ask or initiate. It\u2019s plain and simple rejection.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> She doesn\u2019t understand that even her occasional dismissals make me feel less desirable. I can\u2019t resist her. I wish that I too were irresistible. She says I am but her ability to say no so easily makes it\u2019s hard to believe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe feeling of rejection and the feeling that his wife doesn\u2019t really desire him can lead a man to dark places. One only needs to visit the other RP subreddits to see the impact these rejections have on men. \n\n**Your lack of desire can send him into depression**. If your desire gives him a sense of well being and confidence, then you can understand how the opposite holds true as well. The ongoing perception of a lack of desire will translate to a nagging lack of confidence, withdrawal and depression. \n\nMen scoffed at the author\u2019s push back. *A string of rejections doesn't necessarily mean she is rejecting you as a man* say women, *We are tired, we work too and care for the house and the kids. Just because we don\u2019t want sex, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want you.* Men warn us back: *Any woman sending those signals will undermine the loving environment she most wants because she\u2019ll have one depressed man on her hands*. \n\nIf you still can\u2019t wrap your head around it, the author compares men\u2019s need for sex to women\u2019s need for talking and communication. Men can\u2019t turn off the physical and emotional importance of sex. Regularly turning him down feels the same to him as his sudden silence would feel to you. Imagine how you\u2019d feel if your husband didn\u2019t talk to you anymore, or acted as though connecting with you through conversation was something he did out of duty. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> We\u2019ve been married for along time, I deeply regret and resent the lack of intimacy of nearly any kind for the duration of our marriage. I feel rejected, ineligible, insignificant, lonely, isolated and abandoned as a result. Not having the interaction that I anticipated prior to marriage is like a treasure, lost and irretrievable it causes deep resentment and hurt within me. This in turn fosters anger and feelings alienation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###How can we overcome the sex gap? \n\nWe must choose to love him in the way he needs. If you are viewing his need as physical, that is, important, but perhaps options, then you must stop and wrap your head around this chapter right away! When viewed this way, it\u2019s too easy to make the argument that your need for sleep is just as important as his need for sex. \n\nIf you realize that he\u2019s actually saying *\u201cthis is essential to my feeling of being loved and desired and to counteract my feelings of stress and loneliness\u201d* your response should be very different. It is always ideal to respond to his invitation with your full emotional and physical involvement, knowing that you are touching his heart. \n\nHowever, there are going to be times when you realistically *cannot* manage sexual intimacy with your partner. If you must say no, say with with words from the heart. Make sure that you are being reassuring, reaffirming and adoring. Leave him in no doubt that you love to love him. Through in the fact that you desire him for good measure. Promise to show him later if you can.  \n\nAnd if you say no in a way that reassures him, it can be better than saying yes and then engaging in emotionally detached starfish sex. If you respond physically but without meeting his need to be engaged and desired, STOP! If you are having sex with him, be engaged, you aren\u2019t meeting his needs otherwise. \n\n**You must take an active role in sex**. Many men want a wife who is sexually motivated. TRP and the Christian men that the author interviewed agree. Men want their women to be *his slut*. The religious men are *slightly* more circumspect. They say they want: * a girl next door in the living room but a wildcat in the bedroom*. This means you should make the first move from time to time and bring all you attention and passion for you man into bed with you. \n\n**Make sex a priority**. Ask yourself, are the needs you are meeting the needs he wants met? Does he care about the dishes getting done or does he care about sex? Don\u2019t focus as much on what you want to get done at the expense of your intimate relationship with your SO. Reevaluate your priorities, you can even do this with his help!\n\n*You can be a great wife in every other way, but not doing this one thing that is important to him, and he won\u2019t feel loved.* \n\n***\nThank you for the gold kind internet stranger :-)","title":"'For Women Only' - Sex- Chapter 6","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8o2dtb\/for_women_only_sex_chapter_6\/"}

A few days ago, our place was due for a routine inspection for the fire alarm batteries. So maintenance would be in and out of the apartment in less than 10 minutes.

They kept each others secrets. If we somehow found out, my parent would have each others backs. \n\n- If they were upset with one another, and a guest arrived, they would set their feelings aside. They always looked and behaved like a team. They didn\u2019t leave space for people to get in between them. \n\n- My mom always had meals ready for my dad, on the clock. There were times he worked early and she would wake up at 4-5 am to prepare his breakfast and pack his lunch. \n\n- They never raised their voices at each other. \n\n- When my dad came back from work, she would give him an hour or two to decompress. This was more pertinent when we were younger. We always knew not to bother dad after work. \n\n- Family issues stay in the family. No one ever found out about our conflict. \n\n- My dad trusted his money with my mom. She had access to all his accounts and he would let her manage it. My mom was the type to remember expenses dating back months. So my dad trusted her to manage the finances. \n\n- My mom lived according to my dads means. When my dad struggled financially, she would cut back on expenses and support him through it. She never stressed him out about the downgrades in lifestyle. \n\n- They always answered each others calls, even when busy.\n\n- My mom would clean up, and put herself together before my dad would come home. They both tried to look good for each other. \n\n- This last one I find very cute. They had the same bed time routine.

As each day adds new stress and restrictions, we would all do well to bring some lighthearted joy into our households. \n\nWhat will you do this week to bring some childlike light to your relationship? \n\n***\n\nMy boyfriend has a friend, who is in his 50's. He married a woman much younger than him, she's 29. While she's gorgeous and youthful, they fight. A LOT. Predominantly because the age difference is too big, and she hasn't caught on to what her responsibilities should be.\n\nFor example, yesterday they had to take a flight in the evening to France. The husband was working in the morning and began packing in the afternoon.\n\nWife is out hanging with her girlfriend and returns home 1.5 hours before departure. She hasn't packed. Ensue big argument between the couple since she's acting like an irresponsible child when she's almost 30. Apparently she needed him to tell her what time to come home and what she needed to do, she couldn't think for herself and think like an adult.\n\nWhile this example might be extreme (since there's a 25 year age gap), it's still proves true that even when a man wants a submissive, youthful wife, you will still irritate him by being childish and irresponsible.\n\n*Childlike* is different than *childish.* *Childlike* is when you are open to life's opportunities, are fearless, excited, optimistic. *Childish* is being irresponsible, unmanageable, stubborn, immature.\n\nWives need to be feminine, radiant but also functional. The key is not to let your functionality overrun the relationship (bossy, naggy). How can RPW maintain your childlike optimism while still being functional?\n\n1) **Childlike affection.** Ever seen a little girl hug a puppy, or kiss her parents? Or beg her daddy for a piggy back ride? Giggle when someone harmlessly teases her? She's open with her emotions, she's not afraid to show her love. She gives her affection to those that are dear to her.\n\n2) **Childlike enjoyment.** Think about a little girl eating ice cream, enjoying her favorite lasagna, putting on a pair of beautiful earrings, painting her nails, singing along to her favorite song. She's happy about the simple things in life. She's uninhibited with the pleasures of the world.\nAny good woman knows how to control her emotions - to switch from being functional to being childlike, and a talented RPW knows how to assess which situation requires which quality.","title":"Quarantine Reposts: Childlike vs Childish","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/fmlhdm\/quarantine_reposts_childlike_vs_childish\/"}

But if this kind of thing can work for men, why doesn't it work for women? In short, it's because this does little more than demonstrate that other men want to *sleep with* her, and more than likely whatever man she's trying to apply this dread to *already knows this*, because the majority of women can get sex much easier than the majority of men. This is like trying to brag that you have a lot of air to breathe. It's obvious and not noteworthy in the slightest. Furthermore, most men don't particularly like the idea that their potential partner is a hundred other men's wet dream. Yes, a man will definitely be happy to be with a woman he is aware is beautiful, but that doesn't mean he wants to be given the impression that he's just one in a long series of men to take, or wanting to take, a dip in that lake. (Likewise, male dread performed poorly by a man will give a woman this same impression, which is generally also unpleasant for her -- it's the difference between the player (undesirable) and the man with many options (desirable).)\n\nAvoiding using male dread *does not mean* you need to dress like a nun and avoid male compliments. It does, however, mean that if you're trying to seduce a man, you shouldn't be actively seeking to show him how many other men are interested.\n\nSo if male dread doesn't work, what does?\n\nI'm using the term \"dread\" here because I do consider this the female counterpoint to the male term, but the point in a woman doing this *isn't* to instill a sense of uncertainty in her partner, but instead to instill a sense of *luckiness*. \n\nWhat this means is that, if you want to show a man, \"damnit, you should be lucky to have me!\", don't go about it by trying to show him how many *other* men want you and would be lucky to have you. This *may* work for a man if done well, but it's *highly* unlikely to work for you. So that means don't go farming for compliments with a risqu\u00e9 picture on instagram. Instead, work on showing him *why* he should really be feeling so lucky. This means doing small but noticeable things -- compliment *him* more (men are generally very lacking in terms of getting compliments), give him a massage, just do something nice for him in general. Attractive girls are a dime a dozen. An attractive girl who cares for her partner and treats him with respect and kindness, however, is a girl worth cherishing. Be that girl. \n\nEdited to add: I mentioned in a comment that I learned not to try male dread the hard way. I think my experience may add a valuable note. \n\nIn the very early stages of dating my boyfriend, I tried to show him I was valuable by trying to rub in his nose how many other men were dying to date me. I posted pictures on social media not with the intention to get validation, but with the intent to show him that I was desirable. Not only did this not work, I later found out that it was my other qualities (qualities like those listed above among others) that had not just attracted him in the first place, but that were the reason he didn't leave me in spite of my incredibly failed attempt at making him see me as valuable. Truth be told, there are still occasionally ramifications that come up as a result of how I behaved.

The penis train. Promiscuity. The partner count. The word itself. \n\nSlut.\n\nIt's easy to see that there are drawbacks to being one. Feminists decry \"slut shaming\", redpillians often say that men shouldn't commit to one, men in general just say that, right or wrong, they don't *want* to commit to one. \n\n**But what is a slut?**\n\nReligious conservatives who claim to have red-pill values say that PUA shouldn't be a red pill thing, because it creates sluts. PUA redpillians say religious conservativism isn't red pill at all, because attempting to increase a woman's sexual partner count by one is what \"male sexual strategy\" is all about. How could it be otherwise, when religious conservativism is, at its core, an attempt to culturally restrain that which cannot be restrained... human nature?\n\nBut all these arguments fall flat unless we can answer one important question. \n\n**What is a slut?**\n\nAnd it is an important question, because there is an apparent contradiction in red pill theory, a self-swallowing aspect to the way many people think about it. \n\nIn attempting to be attractive to women, a man tries to increase their count of sexual partners. Yet he himself does not desire to commit to women with high sexual partner counts? Is he not creating the very thing he shuns? Is he not destroying the very world he wishes to live in?  \n\nBut if he tells women not to submit to men's sexual advances, is he not defeating his own efforts at sexual conquest? \n\nIs a man nothing but a hypocrite when he shuns the slut? That depends upon the answer to one important question. \n\n**What is a slut?**\n\nWill the correct answer to this question make this apparent contradiction go away? *I contend that it will.*\n\nTo answer this question, we must remember one fundamental truth about the sexual marketplace: *Women are the gatekeepers of sex, and men are the gatekeepers of relationships*. When we think of a slut as a woman with a high count of sexual partners, we must be aware of what this implies. \n\nFirst, that she has allowed men through the gate of sex many times. \n\nSecond, that she has been allowed, by men, through the gate of relationships very few times... for otherwise, she would have slowed down her pace of acquiring new partners considerably. \n\nNow we are ready to answer the question. \n\n**A slut is a woman whose sexual market value consists mostly of sexual availability, and little else**.  \n\nOr, equivalently, \n\n**A slut is a woman who does not have the ability to turn sexual encounters into relationships**. \n\nLooked at in this way, *of course* men don't want to commit to sluts. The very definition implies it. \n\nHigh partner counts are a symptom of sluttiness, not its cause. Sluts acquire high partner counts not because they \"open their legs too easily\", but because the men they have coupled with do not wish to stay... and so they must, once again, find a new man. \n\nA slut is pumped and dumped many times. But **it is being dumped, not being pumped, that makes a woman a slut**. \n\nThis resolves our apparent contradiction. If a woman's goal of avoiding sluthood is not to avoid sex, but to make a man stay afterwards, this is in no way opposed to a man's goal of getting to sex. It is the sex that is the male biological imperative, not the hasty departure afterwards. \n\nIn fact, that hasty departure provides him with no pleasure at all. Would he not rather met a woman with whom he wishes to have sex *again*? Would he not rather meet a woman whom he prefers to a hasty departure? Of course he would. \n\nBut that is out of his control. Just a woman, the gatekeeper of sex, cannot control how sex-worthy the men around her are, a man, the gatekeeper of commitment and emotional investment, cannot control how relationship-worthy the women he meets are. The only power they have is the binary choice whether or not to open the gate. \n\nSo, to avoid being a slut, don't *refuse to have sex*. Instead, have value beyond just sex. Make men want to see you again. And your partner count will stay low without having to resort to withholding tactics. \n\nBecause withholding tactics don't work. A slut cannot \"reform\" herself by withholding sex. If her only sexual market value is availability, then withholding that leaves her with... nothing to offer. A slut can only reform herself by increasing her value in other areas. If she does so, men will want to stay, and her partner count will stop increasing so fast. \n\nThat partner count is only a symptom, not the disease. \n\n**To avoid being a slut, be a keeper.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"The Slut, and how not to be one.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1j0n7t\/the_slut_and_how_not_to_be_one\/"}

Let him ghost you. Whether you've been dating for a few weeks or you're in between dates and you're unsure about how he feels, give him the chance to disappear. What does that mean? In other words, don't contact him. Don't text him or call him or like his posts. Don't watch his snap stories. Just step back.\n\nA man who is actually interested in you, intrigued by you, and realizes that he craves your company will realize they haven't heard from you and reach out. Men fall in love differently than women. You need to give him the opportunity to miss you.\n\nIf he misses you and wants to see you again, he'll reach out and arrange a date. If he doesn't, it won't even cross his mind to text you. And honestly, that's a good thing. Let him fade away. Don't we want a man who will actively and intentionally pursue us? Why do you want to date someone who doesn't miss you?\n\nIn the meantime, create busyness for yourself as a distraction so you aren't waiting around for his text. Call a friend, go for a walk, bake cookies, watch a documentary on Netflix even so you can learn about a new subject to converse about at your next social gathering or date.\n\nI promise you that if he is actually interested in you he will let you know and it will be clear and direct. He will realize he hasn't heard from you and seek you out. And when he does, it will be intentional and your boundaries, whatever they are, will be respected.\n\n**EDIT:** I say this with the assumption that the woman has actively shown her interest in a man with actions and words and he stops reciprocating or disappears without notice.

And while some women carry fat better than others, for every woman, there is a level of body fat at which she becomes unattractive. \n\nThere is also a great deal of argument as to whether being fat is unhealthy or not, but since people will move heaven and earth to avoid being ugly, when they won't lift a finger to avoid dying twenty years sooner, this really doesn't matter much. \n\nSuffice to say that you don't want to be fat. \n\nAnd yet, despite the fact that women desire desperately not to be fat, and try very hard not to be, still many, many women are... in fact many more than there were in previous generations. Which makes it overwhelmingly likely that some of you reading this are fat. And that still more, perhaps even most, are fatter than you would like to be. \n\nNow, our culture, society, and indeed medical profession has very simple instructions for not being fat: Eat less, move more. They will tell you that your body is a receptacle for something called a \"calorie\", and that if you eat more of these \"calories\" than you burn while moving around, they are going to be stored as fat. And that thus fat loss, or fat gain, is a simple matter of arithmetic. \n\nNow, anyone whose brain has not been surgically replaced with a cauliflower can tell that this is wrong, even if they are not a macho arrogant jerk like me, and therefore are not willing to argue with the food industry, the government, the medical profession, and a whole bunch of know-it-alls quoting from what they learned in the University of It Stands to Reason, or possibly the Post-Graduate School of I Read in a Book Somewhere. \n\nWhy? Because huge numbers of people are fat now, and fifty years ago, they weren't. \"Calories\" didn't come into existence fifty years ago. Neither did gluttony and sloth. Unless you want to try explaining how we, for no apparent reason, birthed several successive generations who were lazier and greedier than every generation before, this simply doesn't add up. \n\nNeither does it add up with your own experience. You know who you are. You've counted \"calories\". And it kinda-sorta worked. For a while. But it was really hard. And unsustainable. And you quit. Then you blamed yourself, instead of the idea, because surely if you had only stuck to it, it would have worked. \n\nExcept a program that 99% of people cannot stick to needs to take the blame for its own failures. We cannot make people fit again by simply demanding a better class of human being, with more \"willpower\". \"Just have more willpower\" isn't any easier than \"just don't be fat\". That's silly. \n\nAdditionally, your great-grandmother did not count \"calories\", because she didn't know what a \"calorie\" was. And she didn't do \"zumba\", either. Because even **I** don't know what that is, and please don't tell me. \n\nSo we are going to start from the basic idea that **you can be slim and proportionate your whole life without ever knowing what a \"calorie\" is, much less counting one**. \n\nAnd we are going to talk about what researchers (NOT physicians, physicians are a bunch of coconuts) know about how the body stores and uses fat. \n\nSo what IS fat, anyway? Well, **fat is bunch of organic stuff that your body can burn for fuel, and can store in some of your cells so you don't die when you have nothing to eat**. \n\nAnd right there is the answer. But you don't see it yet, because getting the answer isn't the hard part... it's asking the right question. Often the answer to our problems are right there, but we can't see them because we don't understand the problem yet. \n\nSo fat is FOR keeping you alive when you don't have anything to eat. Duh. If your body had chlorophyll, or solar panels, or plugged into a wall, and thus had a constant inflow of energy, you wouldn't need the capacity to *store* it at all. Your hair dryer doesn't have a battery in it, but your laptop does. That's because your hair dryer is designed to work in an environment where energy is always available, and your laptop is designed to function without an outside source of energy for at least some period of time. \n\nSo now we know that your body is designed to store fat. That's supposed to happen. And your body is also designed to burn fat. That's supposed to happen, too. And that between these two processes, you're not supposed to get so skinny you can't sustain your body temperature, and you die of cold, or so fat you can't run or climb, and you die of sabertooth tigers. You're supposed to gain a little fat, and lose a little, over and over again. \n\nNow, your body, despite what the \"calorie\" people will tell you, is not a box. It doesn't just have things in it because you put them there. In order to store fat, an active biochemical set of events has to happen to turn things into fat and put them in fat (adipose) cells. In order to burn fat, another set has to happen to order to unpack the fat and send it to muscle cells. \n\nYou body doesn't get fat just because some things are lying around, and it doesn't get thin just because you're low on fuel. It gets fat, or thin, *on purpose*. There are control mechanisms, and things that trigger them. \n\nSo if your body is storing too much, and unpacking too little, so that you gradually expand like a balloon, than its because there is a switch (metaphorically speaking) that is stuck in one position. \n\nWell, researchers know what this switch is, and now you will, too, because [that's what we need to know](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BABM3EUo990). \n\nThe \"switch\" is two hormones: insulin, and glucagon. \n\nInsulin stimulates cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream. Some need it to have this happen at all, some don't, but the important thing here is that adipose (fatty) cells turn this glucose (sugar) into triglycerides (fat), and store it. Beta cells in the pancreas release insulin when blood sugar is high. \n\nGlucagon stimulates adipose cells to unpack triglycerides (fat), and release it into the blood. Other cells can burn this directly, and the liver can also convert it into glucose (sugar). Alpha cells in the pancreas release glucagon when blood sugar is low. \n\nThe important thing to understand here is that you can't have both these hormones high at once. So when your blood sugar is above a certain level, insulin stays high, and *you can't burn fat, no matter how much you have, because you can't get it out of your cells*. \n\nThat's the stuck switch. \n\nIf your blood sugar is too high, your insulin stays high, and you can't burn fat, you can only store it. \n\nThis is what happens when you calorie-restrict. You're eating small meals, but since you keep eating, your blood sugar stays high enough to prevent the release of glucagon in any significant amount. So if you have less energy coming in, but you can't unpack stored energy, you *have* to burn less, because it's physically impossible to burn energy you haven't got. \n\nYou've got loads of fat in your butt, but you're short of fuel, because *you can't get it from your butt into your blood*. You're *hungry*, and your metabolism slows to a glacial speed, because you're short of fuel.\n\nThis is why calorie-restricting diets fail. They're inefficient, because your metabolism is tanked, and they're impossible to stick to, because your brain thinks you're starving. Your brain can only see your blood, not your butt. \n\nSo what to do? \n\nDo what this system was evolved for. Your body fat isn't evolved to sustain you when you eat a salad and a small bun. It's for when you *have no food*. If, instead of six small meals that don't add up to a lot of calories, you eat *nothing*, then your insulin will go low, all that fat can be unpacked from your butt, and you won't be hungry anymore, because why on earth would your body unpack less than it wants, now that you can unpack something?\n\nIn other words, you stop eating tiny meals, and you fast, instead. \n\nWhen we understand this, we understand why grandma wasn't fat, and you are. It's not because you have less self-control than she did. It's not because she ate *more* than you do. It's because of *what* she ate and *when*. \n\nShe ate fat, protein, moderate amounts of starch, and almost no sugar. You eat very little fat, and a whole lot of starch, processed food, and sugar. Guess which one keeps your insulin higher longer? \n\n**If you want to be less fat, eat more fat.**\n\nShe ate at mealtimes, and never in between. She didn't have plastic-wrapped convenience food. She didn't have a microwave oven. If she wanted to eat something, she had to cook it. She and her family ate at mealtimes, and not in between. \n\nYou... snack. Throughout the day. So when does insulin have a chance to drop? \n\n**If you want to stop looking like a cow, stop grazing like one.**\n\nEating real food at defined mealtimes was enough to keep the people of 1960 thin. But if you're already fat, you have to reverse that switch harder. It's called \"intermittent fasting\", although it really should be called \"intermittent eating\", because the idea is to impose long delays between meals. When you run out of sugar, you will unpack the fat. \n\nSounds like starving yourself, doesn't it? But it isn't. Because \"starving\" is when you're running out of fuel, not when you're merrily burning it. You're not starving, you're fasting. It sounds scary, but that's only if you believe that you're just going to keep getting hungrier and hungrier when you don't eat. That's not true. You get hungry, and then you enter *ketosis* (the state where your body unpacks and burns fat), and you're not hungry any more. \n\nAll of those stories about medieval people spending days in \"fasting and prayer\" suddenly make a lot more sense. You don't actually need to shove bread into your face every two hours in order to survive. This works. There's a whole subreddit devoted to it, and you can check it out, it's full of success stories, and you can learn what eating and fasting schedules work for people. \n\nThis method works because it's sustainable. Instead of fighting your body, you're doing what your body was designed to do... store fuel, and then use it. With a little practice, you can even decide how fat you want to be. Some level of subcutaneous fat is good for you, and you can get to decide how much looks good on you. \n\nThere's a lot more science in this rabbit hole; we could talk about how \"sugar\" (the white stuff on your table) is poison, but \"sugar\" (the glucose in your blood) is the energy of life; we could talk about how fruit juice and smoothies are terrible, terrible things, we could talk about how eating anything is a nutrition label is most likely a bad idea; about how butt fat is healthy and belly fat is terrible; about where diabetes really comes from and why \"life-saving\" insulin injections are really expensive now; about why healthcare is so expensive now and how socialism is not the answer and will only make things far, far worse. \n\nBut the important thing to understand is:\n\n* Calories don't matter. Insulin matters. \n* It isn't how much you eat, it's what and when.","title":"How not to be fat.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/m34yr5\/how_not_to_be_fat\/"}

I just wanted to share my experience!\n\nInitial context: this was an important event shoved in the middle of a stressful work week for my husband.\n\nFor my outfit, I chose a super feminine, classy-but-still-trendy look with venue-appropriate shoes & accessories \u2014 & I let my husband have the final choice between 2 dresses.\n\nA few days before the event, I told my husband I\u2019d love to have a refresher on who would be there & what I needed to know. On the drive out there, he came back to that request & gave me a quick summary of everyone he was hoping to get a chance to see & a little insight into each relationship.\n\nOnce there, I was extremely impressed by how many of his coworkers & clients stopped me specifically to tell me how much they love working with my husband. Later on (a few drinks in for everyone!), some of the men started to get a little bro-like & started ripping lightly on my man to me\u2026 I reacted in a friendly way, smiling & joking back, but still saying how awesome he is. A certain work mini-drama was brought up, but he\u2019d given me the context, so I was able to gracefully defuse the situation. At one point, some guy said my husband had obviously married up \u2014 & my husband agreed lol \u2014 but I just thanked him & said I felt like I was the lucky one.\n\nI met a new female employee who is objectively hotter than I am\u2026 When I was younger, this might have triggered me. After so many years with my husband, I fully understand how he operates as a person; it wouldn\u2019t matter how hot or how drunk either person is \u2014 as long as I\u2019m treating him right, he\u2019ll be loyal to me. Instead, I just enjoyed meeting her & noted \\*why\\* I thought she was hotter (trendier clothes, whiter teeth, more \u201cdone\u201d hair & makeup, & skinnier). I could then decide to:\n\n* Spend $ on new wardobe stuff\n* Use the dentist whitening trays in my fridge\n* Update my hair (as for the \u201cdone\u201d-ness \u2014 well, I\u2019ll stay in my lane; I\u2019m a more natural girl, & it works for me)\n* Lose \\~3lbs maybe? not my priority. I have an awesome body & have been working out pretty hard, plus my husband prefers a little softness\n\nOutcome:\n\nMy husband woke me up by saying how he loves me more than I\u2019ll ever know.\n\nI found an insane sale online today & spent $250 to get >$1300 in multiple designer investment pieces (I just got a serious raise & had warned my husband I\u2019d be indulging in some minor retail therapy; when I gave him the summary, he gave me accolades for my smart shopping skills).\n\n\\[The teeth \/ hair stuff is easy.\\]\n\nAlso, got several texts throughout the day saying how many compliments he was getting about me from his colleagues!!\n\nFinally\u2026 we are currently on our first cycle of trying to conceive (after some medical delays, we are both extremely onboard), & I\u2019m super close to ovulation (so wanted sex tonight). I wasn\u2019t too worried about it, since we generally have sex at least 1x\/day, but I knew he was having a super tough week & didn\u2019t want to put any pressure on us. I put on yoga pants, an elegant crop top, & wore my hair his favorite way + made a really easy dinner that he loves. We had lovely (critical!) sex, & now he\u2019s in bed early before an important work presentation tomorrow.\n\nTLDR: Respect (& self-respect) is something that happens internally as well as publically. It creates opportunities for mutual growth! Also, shop the sales.

Although I am not married, I have been in an LTR for four years, and this is my theory based on my experience. I think the perfect wife can be broken down into five different roles:\n\n**Mother**\n\n**Confidante**\n\n**Waitress**\n\n**Whore***\n\n**Cheerleader**\n\n**The Mother** is the nurturer. She is responsible for raising the children, taking care of hearth and home, healing the sick, and providing comfort.\n\n**The Confidante** is the husband's trusted advisor who provides him counsel and support. The First Mate, there to help envision the bigger picture for the family and steer the ship in that direction. A shoulder for the husband to cry on if needed.\n\n**The Waitress** is the cheerful attendant of the husband's daily needs. She makes the food, keeps the man comfortable, and anticipates his needs. She is cute and upbeat, always ready with a smile. Makes the man feel pampered while still feeling masculine.\n\n**The Whore** is the mistress of her man's sexual needs. Her job is to be sexually willing, open, and adventurous. She needs to make him feel wanted--a god among kings. She also provides other sensual comforts like massages. Helps her husband let go and unleash his inner animal.\n\n**The Cheerleader** is the public face of a husband's support from his wife. She too is cheerful, openly supportive of her husband, and helps improve and maintain his public image. She is considered high value by most, and her approval reflects well on her husband. \n\nYou may notice that many of these categories overlap to a degree. And they should; they are all facets of the same woman. Both the Waitress and the Whore are responsible for tending to her man, bolstering his confidence, and reinforcing his masculinity. Both the Mother and Confidante are serious, supportive roles.\n\nIf you're thinking you're not well balanced in all of these areas or that you find yourself lacking in one role, you are not alone. This balance is a constant effort that becomes easier with time and the more you get to know your partner. I said this is the picture of the \"perfect\" wife, and no one in reality is perfect.\n\nIssues arise when women forget some of their roles and favor others too heavily. A very common example is a Mother forgetting her inner Whore. She has children, gains weight, shears off her hair, and dresses in frumpy clothes. Her husband misses out on the sexual fulfillment he needs, and she misses out on the confidence and satisfaction of being the object of her man's desire. \n\nAnother example would be letting the Waitress outshine the Cheerleader. Perhaps a wife excels at anticipating her husband's every whim before he can even imagine it at home, but then at a company dinner party she falls short supporting her husband and actively speaking well of him to his boss and co-workers. \n\nAll of these areas need to be balanced, and which roll is needed when varies from relationship to relationship. We all have all of these women within us!\n\n*We're talking high class hookers\/escorts here.\n\n","title":"The Five Faces of the Perfect Wife","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5pt40s\/the_five_faces_of_the_perfect_wife\/"}

We've been attending mass with them pretty regularly since they were newborns, and while we've gotten more comfortable bringing them, it definitely has a lot of challenges. As anyone who has ever been to a Catholic mass will tell you, it's a rather somber, serious worship service. Lots of quiet time as well. \n\nWe sat down in the same pew we usually do, in the back, by the cry room. We got there a few minutes  early and a lovely older woman who was in the pew right in front of us turned around, smiled at us, and said \"It's so great to see little ones like them at church! God Bless you all.\" We thanked her and mass started.\n\nOur kids were awesome until about 40 minutes in, when they both started getting extra squirmy and my toddler started asking for water and M&Ms lol... and then the woman in front of us got up promptly and looked like she was making a beeline for another pew to sit in. Oh no!!!! Our unruly kid disturbed her and she's moving far, far away. Ugh. We felt like such jerks.\n\nWait, wait wait.. no. That didn't happen. She actually made a bee line to this little table near one of the doors where they have these cute little booklets to take for kiss to look at during mass. She didn't say a word but just smiled at all of us and gave each of my kids a book, which delighted them and got their full attention for a full 5+ minutes (which is basically an hour in toddler time)\n\nAt the end of the service, we thanked her profusely for her small act of kindness. She told us she's a mom of 3 and while her kids are all grown now, she still remembers how hard it was bringing them to mass on a regular basis. She complimented our kids' behavior and said \"just keep coming back every week, I promise it gets easier! The church needs and loves kids! I love hearing babies and kids in church because it means we have a presence of youth.\" \n\nY'ALL! This wonderful, eloquent, kind lady.. I still can't believe we were lucky enough to cross paths with her. She made our whole entire day better with her smile, that small random act of kindness, and her words. We've been parishioners at our church for 6 years and while we love it, we have gotten so so sooooo many annoyed, dirty looks from people of all ages when we attend mass with our kids - and we do NOT allow them to get rowdy or scream or anything like that, we immediately high tail it to the cry room if we sense impending doom. I guess they forget what it's like to have a toddler, or their toddler is an amazing robotic creature who goes on autopilot during church, or they're just perfect parents who are far superior to us... idk. But this beautiful soul we met today made my husband and I feel so comfortable and at ease with our situation. \n\nThere's still lots of incredible people out there in this scary world we live in. Never, ever underestimate the power of a few kind words and doing something nice for a stranger. It can totally change the trajectory of their day.

Throughout these discussions, there's the persistent fear of losing a partner to a younger model. For this reason, I would like to share a personal anecdote and the lesson I derived from it.\n\nMy husband and I were discussing the dating lives of his single male friends and the type of women to whom they're attracted. Curiosity got to me and I asked: \"If you had to describe me as a 'type,' what would that be?\"\n\nHe paused for a moment and replied: \"Jessica Rabbit.\"\n\n*\"What?!\"* If he weren't such a literalist, I would've chided him for mocking me or for this absurd attempt at flattery.\n\n\"You're just so sensual and womanly,\" he explained. \"You could definitely cosplay as her if you wanted to.\"\n\nUm... *no*. On my best days, I can probably pull off Betty Boop... but if I'm being honest, those best days are fewer and far between as of late. I'm frequently exhausted caring for our baby twins. I'm still squishy in the middle after having them. I marvel that I even manage to dress in proper clothes rather than succumb to the desire to wear my fluffy Hello Kitty pajama pants all day long.\n\nSo why, of all people, did Jessica *friggin'* Rabbit come to his mind? **Love Goggles!**\n\nJust as beer goggles can make a drunk guy go home with a girl he wouldn't even look twice at if he were sober, the love goggles can make a husband look at his dear wife as if she is the femme fatale of his adolescent fantasies. If your partner loves and cherishes you, and you regularly shower him with affection, tenderness, and desire, you don't have to spend your days constantly worried that he's going to bang his secretary because you found a gray in your hair that morning; his love goggles won't notice.\n\nNow, this isn't the blue-pilled bullshit that if a man really loves you, it's OK for you to gain 600 lbs and be a slob. No... if anything, **you should feel inspired to be more like the woman he sees through his love goggles.** The day after this conversation, I brought my red lipstick out of the bowels of my purse and bought a new push-up bra. :-)\n\nI suppose it's worth saying, too, that the *reverse* of the love goggles is possible. You could be the hottest piece of ass in your zip code, but if you're a miserable shrew, you probably look like Freddie Krueger to him for making his life such waking nightmare.\n\nHope you find this helpful!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Love Goggles","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/alllji\/love_goggles\/"}

A woman will describe a veritable nightmare of a man and when someone points it out, the inevitable response is: *\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend\u201d* with a handful of trite niceties thrown in. \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the idea of a partner versus a best friend. Your man should not be your best friend. He should never be your best friend. The boyfriend, fianc\u00e9, husband role is different from the best friend role. When there is overlap you risk failing to vet properly, you lack an external support network, and you accept behaviors that are not acceptable from a partner. \n\n###The Best Friend vs The Boyfriend\n\n#####*Ask yourself: What are the biggest things I\u2019ve done for a best friend? How optional was it? How optional would it be for a partner?* \n\nHere are two of mine: \n\n* When my BFF had her twins, I visited for a weekend to give her some relief. When the weekend was over, *I went back to my life*. Her husband, doesn\u2019t get the option to go back to his life. He was right there in the trenches with her the whole time. There was no break for him, no returning to work on Monday. And you know, her family thought I was just wonderful for the time I spent. What they didn\u2019t see was her husband doing laundry at 3am so she could sleep and the house could still function. It was optional for me, it was parenthood for him.  \n\n* We\u2019re at an age now when grandparents are dying. When my BFFs grandfather died, I didn\u2019t make the funeral because it was up in Queens and that made it entirely impractical. When my dear friend from HS\u2019s grandmother died, I *did* make it to the funeral because it was in our hometown on a Saturday. I love them both equally but I had the *option* to attend these events and I did as much as *I was able to do*. But do you know how didn\u2019t have an option \u2013 their husbands. Those men were there holding their wives and supporting them through it all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou may take care of a friend when she is sick, drive her to the hospital or pick her up from the airport. I say *may* because it\u2019s not your responsibility. If there is something more pressing in your life, you handle your other responsibilities first. But if your partner needs a ride to the hospital, you will leave work at the drop of a hat to take him and sit with him for the duration. \n\nThe role of a friend and a partner is simply different. You make vacation plans for next year\u2019s trip with your best friend. You make plans for where you will move with your partner. You share all your life\u2019s details with your best friend because that it how you bond. You share all your life\u2019s details with your partner because what happens in your life directly impacts his. You discuss a job offer with a friend to get an opinion and help you decide. You discuss a job offer with a partner because it means reassessing your future together. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn my job, we tell married clients that they have to be rowing the boat together to reach their goals. To stretch that metaphor \u2013 your partner and you must row one boat together, your friends and you are in separate boats heading along a similar path. \n\n*This is a good thing* because while you are rowing along, you don\u2019t see the boat from the outside. Your friends are there to look out for you. She sees things that you might not see. She is there to give you support if you start to tip over. She\u2019s there as a companion while the Captain is busy charting the course. And sometimes, she\u2019s there to throw you a line when you can\u2019t row anymore. \n\nYou cannot combine the roles. If you do, you become to insular in your relationship and can lack socialization. You lose an outside perspective. You *need* outside support when you and your partner go through hardships and cannot fully support each other. All this *can be* a problem in a marriage but it is a much bigger deal during the vetting stage. \n\n*And those are the women who most often default to this idea.* \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBecause if you are vetting and you\u2019ve become so attached that he is your best friend, a break up means losing both your boyfriend and the future you see with him *and* losing your best friend, your social outlet and your emotional support. \n\nFurther, we love our friends and it is easy to forget that what is acceptable behavior in a friend is not always acceptable behavior in a partner. You may not care that your best friend smokes because you don\u2019t live with her and you don\u2019t plan to have children with her. You can be concerned about your best friend\u2019s drinking but her addition wouldn\u2019t derail your future. You can even quietly think your best friend is terrible for cheating on her man while still loving and supporting her because it\u2019s not you she is betraying. Any of these behaviors in a partner is a massive red flag that needs to be examined. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon\u2019t use \u201che\u2019s my best friend\u201d to justify allowing bad behavior from a partner. Fear of losing two roles at once makes us hold more tightly to men we should not. Don\u2019t look to your partner to fill a role that rightly belongs to a woman who is dear to you. One person should not be responsible for fulfilling both roles. You will lose out if you fill them with one person.  **In short: if your boyfriend is your best friend, then it\u2019s time to find a new best friend.**   \n","title":"Your Man is not your Best Friend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/afd58p\/your_man_is_not_your_best_friend\/"}

I've been thinking a lot about these things lately due to some TRP skeptics asking questions like \"do you really believe women are immature?\" These women want to be thought of as \"mature\" and are insulted by the thought of being anything otherwise. After all if you\u2019re not \"mature\" you are lumped into the \"little kids\" category, and that's degrading. Or is it?\n\nThis illusive want for maturity always left me a little uneasy, because I felt like people were asking this question without even understanding what it means to be \"mature\". I asked myself what is \"maturity\", how does someone know if they have it, how does one gain it, and what is its function?\n\nThen I came across this post: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/1k0izp\/what_is_it_like_for_a_man_to_have_to_hidesuppress\/cbk64sr?context=3\n\nAfter I read this, I realized something, being mature isn't a rite of passage, it's not something that happens to you as you get older, because you are older, but rather it's something you gain by being strong when you have to, *because you have to*. It's something that happens to you when you have to struggle against real adversity. But, I also realized it's not necessarily a thing worth striving for. \n\nI composed a thought experiment about a fictitious child. This child is no older than 10 years old, but both his parents are dead. He has no access to health care, or any other federal aid, and he is the sole provider of his baby brother, who is only 2 years old and can't fend for himself. He does everything in his power to care for his brother, from begging, to digging through garbage, even giving his little brother food when it means skipping a meal himself. Even so his baby brother dies in his hands, either due to malnourishment, or disease, it's irrelevant, the little brother dies. \n\nThere is a reason why this fictitious story is sad, because it is forcing a child into a position of maturity, when he shouldn't have to be. A child assuming a real position that an adult would normally have to assume is a sad story because we want to hold onto that youth and innocence that the child possesses. We don't want to burden him with the \"maturity of adulthood\". This thought experiment made me realize that not only can lack of maturity be a good thing, it's actually a *gift men give us*. Men want to protect us from maturity, the same way society wants to protect that child from maturity.\n\nAs we all know, men have a naturally inclination to protect us. But, now I've realized that under that \"umbrella of protection\" men also protect us from the burden of *having to be* mature. Reading the post (above), I realized when a man chooses to be strong and push down his emotions, he does it so that we don't have to. When he becomes mature, jaded, and cynical, he does it so that we can maintain our innocence, youth, and liveliness. At the end of the day someone has to be able to step up and deal with it when shit really goes down, someone has to be able to put aside their fears and fight if need be. Men do this so that we don't have to. They are protecting us, and not because we are \"the weaker sex\", but because they don't want to have to burden us with that. That's what maturity actually is, it's a burden. \n\nWhen we maintain our innocence, they feel like they've been successful because they've done their role \"as men\" to protect us. \u201cImmaturity\u201d isn\u2019t an insult, it\u2019s a gift. Men give us so much, and all they ask in return is that we respect them, and share that youthful vitality with them so that, once and a while, they can remember what it's like to be a kid too.","title":"Ponderings on \"Maturity\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1krml5\/ponderings_on_maturity\/"}

Soon we were all on a first name basis and laughing heartily. Then SO and some others turned up. They joined us briefly and went their seperate ways again.   \nWe left relatively late, I had been roped into deconstruction and cleanup and SO was obliging. He was so happy with how the evening went, apparently a new project was being born that evening. He will receive a slight promotion and the permission to work from home on Occassion. Apparently I left a very good impression and my demeanour impressed his superiors whose spouses I sat with.   \nI have come a long way from the shy, obese girl who was predicted to never formally graduating school to the woman I am now. I always stood with my man who was also slightly awkward and bloomed late. I believed in him and supported him as best as I was able.","title":"Levelling Up and a Field Report","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/s5fmkb\/levelling_up_and_a_field_report\/"}

Like.....a long time. It started as something I just couldn't believe, then turned into a guilty pleasure. Even at my most BP, tumblr-esque moments, I still found this place so weirdly fascinating. Of course, I was super upset: what do you mean men like feminine women??? I had always tried so hard to push down my more feminine traits, seeing them as \"weaker.\" I thought I was better than that - charming, I know. As I read, I hated that I saw the points, even agreed in some way with what was being said around here. But still I lurked.\n\nAbout two and a half years ago, after dropping out of school due to financial reasons and a rough breakup, I decided I needed to take some time to get myself together. I figured it couldn't hurt to try out the whole nun mode thing. Arguably the best thing I ever did for myself. \n\nI spent six months working out my issues with my femininity, putting in the work to heal myself, to present myself to the world in a better light, and to take care of myself. I got therapy for personal trauma. I started taking care of myself, body, mind, and spirit. I found that I was a whole person on my own. Because, in spite of the whole \"be your own woman, you don't need anyone\" mentality, that was something I lacked before. Before, I was approaching being my own woman out of spite, leaving me angry and sad inside. This way, I was doing it to better myself.\n\nAbout two years ago, about a month after coming out of nun mode, I met the love of my life. He is kind, respectful, but also a fantastic leader. He is the kind of man that I strive to be my best for. And honestly.....RP works. This has been the most fruitful and happy relationship I've ever been in. He constantly mentions how lovely I am, how I have this \"womanly air\" about me, and how happy he is to have me in his life. We live together and are actively working on our goals we wish to accomplish before marriage.\n\nOf course, I'm still working to improve myself. I've gone back to school and am working toward finishing my undergrad degree. I'm working on losing a serious amount of weight (started in nun mode, had some success, then med changes messed me up). But I am so happy living in a way that allows me to lean into my feminine nature and play into my strengths. I am honestly thankful that this sub was able to guide me toward a different direction, one where I could form a relationship out of respect and understanding of differences, instead of demanding that my partner see my way.\n\nAnyway, that's my intro\/love letter to RPW. A huge thank you to all of the lovely people who contribute to this community and help people like me figure out life.","title":"Intro, or how lurking here has fixed my (25F) life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/hnesuk\/intro_or_how_lurking_here_has_fixed_my_25f_life\/"}

The blue-pilled, ultra-feminist version of me would roll in her grave if she saw me now, but I do basically all of these for my husband? (except 7 and 8 because we don't have kids, don't plan on having kids either lol).\n\nI have dinner ready for my husband before he gets home, unless it's specifically something he requested to cook together as a fun activity. Or unless we wanted to go out for dinner. We made deep dish pizza last week as a fun activity to do together, but most of the time I plan to have dinner ready when he walks through the door. If we are going out, I plan on being ready when he gets home so he doesn't have to wait around for me to change, do my makeup, or find my handbag.\n\nBefore my husband gets home from work, I clean up the dishes from cooking dinner + fix my appearance really quick. A spray of perfume, a little powder on my shiny nose, etc.  Even if I changed clothes after work into something more comfortable, I don't change into oversized sweats or clothes with stains and holes in them. A nice fitted pair of yoga pants and a soft blouse or sweater are comfortable for an evening together while still looking pretty and feminine.\n\nWhen he gets home from work, my husband loves to take a moment to decompress. He walks through the door and greets me with a kiss before he goes upstairs to change from his work jeans into an attractive pair of jogger sweats to be more comfortable. Meanwhile, I plate up his dinner and ask what he would like to drink. I bring him his food and we eat together. I ask if he wants another helping of dinner. He offers to wash the dinner plates and silverware, which is very nice of him (the dishes I used to cook are usually already washed and in the dishwasher before he gets home, so no need to worry about those). I say \"oh, I can do those baby don't worry about it\" but he shoos me out of the kitchen so he can wash the dinner dishes.\n\nWe unwind together with a little tv (family feud or jeopardy are fun) or play a game (video games or board games). I ask him about his day and he tells me stories about what happened at work, if anything exciting happened. I like this time of day when we relax together and talk about our days. I rarely have a need to complain to him, but I never do right when he gets home. This is his time to relax and unwind from work. I feel like I never complain or nag him, I never feel the need to! (compared to some of my other friends, who I feel constantly nag and complain to their husbands...those poor men...)","title":"This 1955 \u2018Good House Wife\u2019s Guide\u2019 Explains How Wives Should Treat Their Husbands","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/eugwu4\/this_1955_good_house_wifes_guide_explains_how\/"}

If I look closely, I can see their spirits astral-projecting back to the year 2001, when my cousin \u2018Chuck\u2019 married his World of Warcraft girlfriend (of four months) at the local Red Lobster, and was then scammed for thousands of dollars that she wired back to her grandma in South Africa.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve observed a different type of stigma when it comes to online dating. Perhaps you\u2019ve simply observed other people (especially other women) making a little moue of condescension when someone mentions their foray into online dating-- as if taking concrete action to increase your chances of finding a quality man cheapens the ensuing relationship.\n\nBut as for me-- I needed online dating, stigma or not. For a 20-something working in a rural town where the pinnacle of nightlife was Dollaritas at Applebee\u2019s, populated only by unemployed dudes and perhaps 50-year-old truckers, online dating just made sense. Gone were the days of college and grad school where I could meet 300 guys every new semester, and if I didn\u2019t care for any of them, I could find fifty dudes at the nearest seminar that was giving away free Koozies. There just weren\u2019t many jobs drawing high-value men to my area.\n\nI wasn\u2019t getting insane opportunities to just stumble into a great guy anymore. I needed to cast a wide net that would maximize my chances of finding a compatible, quality man. And if you\u2019re reading this, maybe you need to cast a wide net online too.\n\nHere is a short guide to online dating as a RP-minded woman. This advice comes from my own experience of taking a hard look at my SMV, learning to intentionally date, and eventually marrying a wonderful man that I met on a dating app.\n\n**Prerequisites for Serious Dating**\n\nConsider for a moment whether you are fully prepared to start seriously dating. Are you\u2026\n\n1. **Free of previous romantic entanglements?** You\u2019re not still hung up on that guy you had a crush on in grad school, are you? You\u2019re not just doing this to occupy your time until your ex-boyfriend Rodrigo decides to start paying attention to you again, right?\n2. **Within the BMI range of 18-24?** This will astronomically improve your chances of success.\n3. **Able to dedicate a little time each day \\*and\\* at least one Friday\/Saturday night weekly to this?** You could hire Kazuo Ishiguro to write you a compelling bio. You could have a profile picture taken with the Queen of England. Maybe Jason Momoa's in your DMs on OKCupid. But if you don\u2019t have the space in your life to actually read your messages and follow up that weekend by going on a date, you\u2019re shooting yourself right in the foot.\n4. **Is your brain screwed on straight when it comes to sex?** This entire post assumes a basic understanding of RPW principles. You should not be having sex without exclusivity and a serious level of commitment. \u2018Casting a wide net\u2019 should not mean your n-count is also cast wide. If you\u2019re still in the mindset that the first, second, or third date is going to lead to sex, STOP and do a little more reading and thinking on this topic.\n\nIf you answered \u2018no\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you might consider a **BRIEF** stint in nun mode to fix up any of the aforementioned issues. Making your online dating debut with all of the above completed-- rather than fixing these problems after you\u2019ve already screened through hundreds of guys in your area-- will be an asset.\n\nBut remember, online dating is a numbers game, and there is an element of time involved. It is usually possible to work on improving yourself while you continue to see what\u2019s out there. Every day that you delay dating is a day that you could have screened five more guys and gotten one little step closer to finding a great man. This is why nun mode should be used sparingly and only when there is a dire situation that must be resolved before you can date freely.\n\n**Selecting an Online Dating Service**\n\nThe \u2018best\u2019 online dating site might be different from region to region. In my area, OKCupid is the best site for a relationship-minded woman. However, here is some broad guidance:\n\n* You want a service that has a large user base in your area. Don\u2019t be drawn in by sleek niche websites designed to appeal to Gen Z\/millennials, and don\u2019t be drawn in by gimmicks like \u2018the female-friendly dating site\u2019. If there\u2019s no dudes on there, it won\u2019t matter. In some areas Bumble and Hinge are very popular. However, in my area I found that they were not used by many guys, and the ones that did use them also had profiles on OKC.\n* You want a service that prompts all users to fully complete their biographical information. You want to be able to reliably filter based on important details. This typically rules out Tinder due to its skimpy (picture-based rather than profile-based) design.\n\n**Constructing Your Own Profile**\n\nMen are visual creatures. The foundation upon which your profile is built is your picture. This is what gets your foot in the door, like it or not-- so make it count.\n\nRequired for a good profile picture:\n\n1. **Your primary profile pic should only be of you**.\n2. **No selfies.** A selfie as your profile pic communicates one of two things: Either you\u2019re the self-absorbed type that\u2019s always taking selfies and looking to social media for validation, or you\u2019re antisocial and didn\u2019t have any good pictures people took of of you actually out doing things. \n3. **No weird artsy filters, no weird angles.** Just a nice picture that actually shows what you look like. \n4. **Don\u2019t include men in ANY of your pictures**, unless it was a picture of you and Hulk Hogan.\n5. **One or two pictures with other girlfriends are OK**, especially if you were doing something cool, but they should not be your primary profile pic.\n\nNow, as for the body of your profile: A high-value man will probably not be scouring the seventh circle of your online profile the way women sometimes do. However, to attract a serious, intelligent guy, I would advise that you:\n\n1. **Demonstrate that you are literate.** Spell-check your work, write in full thoughts, and make sparing use of emojis and acronyms.\n2. **Demonstrate that you have a sense of humor.** (That one\u2019s on you.)\n3. **Demonstrate that you took this relatively seriously.** If the entire body of your profile is \u201cIdk ask me hahah\u201d, you might think this comes across as lighthearted, flighty, and charming-- but you might as well have written \u201cI\u2019m going to respond to your inquiries with one-word responses or even acronyms. The onus will be entirely on you to carry the conversation. Then I will ghost you because, incredibly, and counter-intuitively, **I** found **YOU** boring.\u2019\n4. **Demonstrate that you are used to being treated well.** If your profile includes \u201cTired of all the games. Just ready for something real. No hookups!!!!!!!\u201d-- you are absolutely screaming to the world that you gravitate towards assholes, and maybe even sleep with them indiscriminately, but that now you\u2019re tired of all that and want to find some nice man, even though you\u2019re going to bring an insane amount of psychic baggage from your crappy exes.\n5. **Demonstrate that you are employed, financially stable, or at the very least, an industrious woman.** High-value men aren\u2019t going to be turned on by your five masters\u2019 degrees, but they WILL be looking for evidence that you\u2019re intelligent, industrious, and reasonably self-sufficient. In the year 2020, a quality man will not want to embark on an entirely new relationship with a woman who can\u2019t currently take care of her own bills.\n\nThat\u2019s it for Part 1. In [Part 2,](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ha5249\/online_dating_with_purpose_part_2_the_golden\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) we will discuss the importance of your own search criteria, how to chat and secure the first date, and how Willy Wonka will fix your psychic dating hang-ups.","title":"Online Dating with Purpose Part 1: Sister, Cast Thy Net Wide","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/h9nxyx\/online_dating_with_purpose_part_1_sister_cast_thy\/"}

I felt panicked and like I couldn\u2019t deal with anything. Felt like a such a loser wimp but went ahead and called my mom and asked her to get the kids and keep them for a few days. I\u2019m so glad I did. It would have been awful if my kids had been home. \n\nI\u2019m shocked by how horrible it was. I don\u2019t mean any disrespect to people who have seen violent crime, but I do feel like I had to watch someone get beheaded. It seemed like more than watching a beheading. I had to watch and be part of it and then deal with the broken pieces of the dismembered person. It was just... horrible. My kids would have been scared out of their minds, because I was screaming and sobbing uncontrollably. The blood and gore, plus the knowledge that I was looking at pieces of my child was just too much to handle quietly.\n\nMy mind is blown that this is a \u201ccommon medical issue.\u201d I know so many women who have lost two, three, even seven children, and some of them were technically stillborns, and not miscarriages.

I\u2019m so sad. I feel like a hungry thief snatching at all the signs that the pregnancy exisited. I wanted my baby. I\u2019m so sad that the relationship with this baby is over so soon. I don\u2019t blame myself - I really believe that my body acted as an impartial Mother Nature and rejected the baby because it had a bad abnormality. I\u2019m still so sad though. Am I unreasonable for feeling so deeply lonely? All my food adversions have just disappeared. No pregnancy nausea or tiredness or anything. Some water weight is still floating around. I\u2019m still bleeding from the miscarriage. I\u2019m happy to have my two sons, but I miss the other baby that didn\u2019t make it. I feel even more strongly that life is worth all the grim and blood and death. \n\nBut I am just so so sad about my little baby.

I think a far superior question is what vetting questions you should ask yourself about the man you're with. My thoughts became extensive enough on the topic that I decided to make a separate post. \n\nThese are questions I asked myself while I was getting to know my current s\/o, and questions I asked myself while I was deciding whether or not to accept the proposal and engagement of my last. These questions provided me valuable guidance, and gave me the courage to do the right thing for myself and my future family. For me, they're non-negotiable. Someone once told me that the greatest gift you can give your children is their father. This isn't a list of what I want in a man, this is what I feel is essential if I expect to build a life and family with someone. \n\n- Do I respect him? Do I think he's admirable, and do I look up to him? Do I find myself more often asking him for advice or feeling the need to give him advice? Am I proud to show him off to my family and friends? Many woman today don't seem to answer this in the affirmative. It is very difficult to cultivate a healthy relationship with a man you don't respect, and will often leave both people miserable. You should trust his judgement and guidance, and be proud to be his. You should be attracted to him, physically, and also to his character. \n\n- Is he honest with me? Trusting his honesty and sincerity is a must for a future husband. If you can't trust his word, you can't trust your entire world. You deserve to know the truth about who he is, even the bits he might regret or that might hurt your feelings. It's the foundation of the entire house. Be someone he can tell the truth to. Don't love him because he's perfect, because no one is, and it only pressures him to lie to keep up the frame. If he knows this, and still feels the need to keep things from you, you will wonder your entire life what is real and what is a facade. \n\n- Do I feel safe and comfortable being honest with him? This is the flip side ladies. If you're with someone that demands perfection from you, you will feel that same pressure to maintain an illusion of perfection. Your husband should be someone that you can come to with anything. If you're pretending to be someone you're not while you're dating, it certainly isn't fair to him, and it also isn't fair to you. Find someone who loves you, accepts your limitations, and helps you be better. Dishonesty is often a personal problem that you need to work through, but you should never be afraid to tell the truth to your partner.\n\n- Does he make me feel desirable and valued? This is the equivalent of a man's need for respect. How does he look at me? How does he react when I do something special for him? How does he hold me? He should look at you like there's nothing else in the world he's looking for. He should hold you like there's nothing else he's reaching for. Of course, this comes with the assumption that you are putting effort into the relationship, but when you do, does he appreciate it? Many women have turned away from traditional marriage because many men have taken those women for granted. This question includes feeling desired and beautiful in the bedroom, as well. \n\n- What is he like when he is upset? Many men, especially younger men, have not yet gained the reins on their anger or frustrations. Does he shout and curse at you unnecessarily? Is he quick to become physically aggressive towards other men? Does he have a quick temper? Is it worse when he drinks? Is he rude? Men might think this behavior is \"alpha\" but it is quite the opposite, and a major turn off. Good, strong men are in control of their emotions and words as much as they are in control of situations. A soft, low, stern tone is much more effective at communicating grievances than throwing a tantrum like a child. \n\n- Are we compatible with values, morals, priorities, religion, finances, style, motivations, politics, etc? I can't make this question more specific, because everyone's compatibility varies individually. But do you often find yourself in disagreement with him about the things in your life you both want and care about. Infatuations can often distract us from learning the core of a person, and can cause us to overlook serious compatibility issues that might not matter now, but will matter in 5, 10, 20+ years. This includes things like how you want to raise your children, what amount of spending and saving is acceptable, where you want to live, and even, what constitutes an ideal weekend? Significant differences in answers indicate a pretty serious problem. I know these questions can be hard to ask, but they are invaluable. \n\n- Is he receptive to my needs, concerns, and ideas? While many of us RPW believe in the captain\/first mate dynamic, and trust our men to lead us, we still need to find a man who values our input, including things within the relationship, that we might have concerns about. If something's important to me, does he make it important to him too? If something makes me happy, does he make it a priority? If something upsets me or makes me uncomfortable, does he care?\n\n- Does he help me be the best version of myself? Does my love and respect for him inspire me to improve, to take care of my body, to sort myself out? Does my commitment do the same for him, or does he use it as an excuse to \"let himself go,\" physically or with general motivation? Does he have humility about the things within himself that he should work on? Does he know how to apologize and how to forgive? A healthy relationship makes both participants better and stronger.\n\n- How does he act when he's faced with a challenge? Does he give up or push forward? Is he a hard worker? Salary and job security are fine measures of success, but choose a man with the attitude of a successful man, not just the bank account of one.

Human brains have biases that can easily be exploited if you play your cards right. Women who are young and beautiful are rewarded. Men who are rich and powerful are rewarded. Everyone else is generally left to the wayside: the old, the weak, the poor.   \n \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're good-looking? You're rich? You're friendly? You're a good person! You are a superhero!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're ugly? You're poor? Not socially adept? You won't socially succeed as well as your peers.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure, there are exceptions and complexities to all of this that I don't fully understand. Exceptions are not rules. I see so many posts on certain subreddits saying that rich and beautiful people are secretly shallow and unhappy. I'm sure some of them are, but the majority of them are good people that get to reap the benefits of being the ideal, and average people just attack them to feel better about themselves. To feel that life is fair. Yet the average can't help but admire, because they are playing the game right. There are people that exist who have it all, they are just born that way. There are some who will never have it all, and they are just born that way.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know when you are born, life doesn't \"owe\" us anything. I just wish we didn't tell people to just \"be yourself\" and the good things will come because this simply is not the truth. You can be a \"version\" of yourself that matches more closely to the ideal, an ideal that is constantly evolving, but you are still changing yourself. We all have to whether we like it or not.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't opt-out of this game because humans crave the acceptance of others. They need it to survive.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt all just seems like one big sick evolutionary game. Men cannot be themselves. Women cannot be themselves. People cannot be themselves, it is not advantageous to do so.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, then there is the argument of defining what even the \"self\" is in the first place. A discussion that probably belongs on the philosophy subreddit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing note: So, what is the point of all this? I am not sure, I am just thinking. Though I don't really love that this is the way the world works, I am fully aware that this is a system I CHOOSE to participate in, one that I will be a part of for the rest of my life. I could easily just save enough money to go live on a wireless ranch for the rest of my life. I don't want to sound like I am whining, I am constantly trying to improve myself every day. I am simply reconciling with the harsh truths of reality. I'm not sure how I will ever tell my children that this is the way the world works, I can only hope maybe I can advocate for a better world for my children to live in.","title":"The existence of all red pill ideology highlights one big issue: Why do we tell people looks\/money\/personality type doesn't matter when it does?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/myx2no\/the_existence_of_all_red_pill_ideology_highlights\/"}

These posts always read the same: the woman is *elated* by this arrangement, except for when she's exhausted, frustrated, short-tempered, and has no time for herself, let alone her husband, and it causes tension in her marriage... and that's most of the time. Rarely does the narrative include a compelling *reason* for such circumstances, such as the partner having a really taxing career that doesn't pay enough to hire help, like law enforcement officer or EMT. It seems to always be the result of some ideal that tries to pull from both the traditional view of a housewife and the modern view of a career woman. Well, I'd like to summarize what *most* of the responses to these posts say: the cost of having a stay-at-home-mom or a stay-at-home-wife is the man being the primary breadwinner.\n\nNow, I know there's someone out there who makes this work (perhaps with a secret identical twin who lives in the walls), so I'll give my disclaimer that these statements are not all-inclusive. As a general rule, however, it is not a sustainable, long-term plan for someone to work 40 hours a week, perhaps more, while also maintaining a household alone, *especially* once they have children. If your goal is a marriage where the woman does all of the housework, including cooking and childcare, the only real way to cultivate a healthy and happy home life is for the man to be the main breadwinner so she can stay home and do that. That's not to say it's all or none. Part-time, seasonal, or occasional work like substitute teaching or babysitting is absolutely doable. Full time work, particularly something physically or mentally exhausting, likely is not.\n\nThe average dual income parents get up every morning and feed and dress their children, before feeding and dressing themselves for the day. They then drop their kids off at daycare\/school, before going to work, where they participate in budget and client meetings, implement projects\/presentations\/programs\/::insert specific corporate term\/responsibility here:: with an appropriate level of enthusiasm. They often take breaks with coworkers, which means they have to engage in small talk or discuss work, instead of truly decompressing. If they're lucky, they get off at a set time, pick up their children, and head home. At this point, the children need to receive love and affection, dinner needs to be cooked, the laundry needs to be folded, the Christmas presents need to be wrapped, the Amazon packages need to be returned, the house needs to be tidied, the kids need to be bathed and put to bed... the list goes on and varies seasonally. There's literally endless amounts of work to be done and *about* four hours in which to do it, depending on commute, every night. On top of this, *both* adults need time to decompress, perhaps take a moment for themselves, and connect with each other to keep their marriage strong.\n\n*Four hours is not enough time for one person to do all of these things, always.*\n\nLife requires balance. If you want a true dual income, you'll have more money and less time, which means you have to have dual household responsibilities, however that might look. Maybe he does more traditionally masculine chores, such as chopping wood for the fire, taking out the trash, caring for the lawn, putting up Christmas lights, and cleaning the gutters, while she cooks, cleans the kitchen and bathrooms, and keeps the kids entertained. Maybe the opposite is true or maybe they trade off. Perhaps they hire help. There's no right or wrong way to split the chores, but in the short time that you both have away from work, you *have* to split or outsource them or they won't get done... or some of them will and there will be resentment and tears and frustration and missed time with the kids or each other. If both partners would prefer a stay-at-home-parent to take the bulk of these responsibilities, they're going to have to make sacrifices, including career momentum and financial standing. You'll have more time, but you might have an older car and off-brand clothing and fewer vacations. You cannot have the best of both worlds.\n\nNo one can have it all, all the time, and that's worth remembering when you sit down with your new fianc\u00e9 and discuss the breakdown of household chores, which you should *absolutely* do, no matter which direction you lean. If you plan to work full time, don't agree to also be a full time SAHW\/SAHM, because in most cases, it can't be done and you'll find yourself venting on Reddit.","title":"The cost of being a SAHM\/SAHW is a husband who is the primary breadwinner.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ri9mtk\/the_cost_of_being_a_sahmsahw_is_a_husband_who_is\/"}

We need to make a clear distinction between \"this is your committed long term relationship, fix it instead of abandoning it\", and \"hey, this dude you went on two dates with is showing clear red flags... look for someone else\". \n\n3. We need to recognize and call out situations where trying to \"fix\" the relationship would put someone in severe danger (usually physical, but sometimes emotional or legal, too), and advise those women to seek self-protection, rather than marital bliss. \n\n4. We need to be able to provide more experienced guidance so that RPW's values can be made clear to new readers. \n\nSo here's what we are going to do:\n\n1. The rule will be \"Don't advise abandonment of an LTR before trying other options, unless someone is in danger\". \n\n2. This will only apply to something that's really a serious commitment, not a vetting process. Use your common sense. We will not be \"punishing\" users for grey area stuff, but those who try to make RPW into \/r\/relationship_advice will be shown the door. \n\n3. We will compile, and take additional suggestions for, a list of constitutes \"danger\". It will include things like violence and long term unilateral emotional abuse. It will not include things like \"said something mean once\". This will go on the sidebar, and we will encourage anyone who fears for someone else's safety to link to it. \n\n4. Yes, we are undermodded. We have asked someone new to join the mod team, and she has graciously accepted. Her mod account should show up some time in the next week. She will be focusing on \"troll control\", so that others can type words more, and click buttons less. \n\nThanks for your patience. We realize that your trust is not automatic, but we also have marriages, jobs, friends, children, and lives of our own, and sometimes we have little time to spare, and a great deal of difficulty attracting appropriate people to do some of the tedious and often thankless work of sustaining a *not just female, but feminine* space in a culture increasingly hostile to femininity.\n\nWe realize that some people need heavy moderation, but there is also a core community that simply needs to be left alone to use their common sense, and protected from trolls so that their voices do not get drowned out.","title":"Policy Discussion on \"Just Leave Him\".","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ixfekx\/policy_discussion_on_just_leave_him\/"}

I\u2019ve adapted it a bit to make it more relatable to us as RPW. It goes like this:\n\nHundreds of years ago, a young woman named Mei-Ling got married to the son of a wealthy family and moved into her husband and in-laws\u2019 home, as was customary in those times. Shortly after she began to live with her new family, Mei-Ling realized that she couldn\u2019t get along with her new husband at all. They had completely different views and personalities, and Mei-Ling often felt angry at the way her husband acted. It didn\u2019t help that her husband constantly criticized and judged her for the things she did.\n\nDays, weeks, months, and years passed. Mei-Ling and her husband never stopped fighting and arguing with each other. But what made the situation worse for Mei-Ling was that, according to ancient tradition, Mei-Ling had to submit to her husband and defer to his wishes and leadership. All of the anger and the unhappiness in the house was causing Mei-Ling\u2019s children and her in-laws to feel great distress and uneasiness.\n\n\nFinally, Mei-Ling had had enough. She couldn\u2019t stand her husband\u2019s bad temper and dictatorship any longer and decided to do something about it! Back in those days, divorce was very taboo, and would not result well for her or her children. She had to do something that would keep all of her family taken care of. So Mei-Ling went to a good friend of her father\u2019s, an experienced herbalist named Mr. Zhang. She told him about her entire situation and asked if he could sell her some poison so that she could solve her marital problems once and for all.\n\nMr. Zhang sat in silence as he contemplated her situation. After a while, he finally said, \u201cMei-Ling, I will help you solve your problem, but only if you listen to me and do exactly as I say.\u201d Mei-Ling, desperate for a solution, quickly replied, \u201cOf course, Mr. Zhang. I will do exactly what you tell me to do!\u201d Mr. Zhang disappeared into his back room, and after minutes of shuffling around, emerged again with a packet of herbs.\n\nHe looked at Mei-Ling with a serious expression, and told her, \u201cYou cannot use a poison that would get rid of your husband immediately, because the people around you would immediately suspect you. Therefore, I have given you a very complex blend of herbs that will slowly build up as poison in his body over time. Every day, prepare a delicious meal for him and put a spoonful of these herbs in his food.\n\n\u201cHowever, you must be very cautious so that no one suspects you of murder. From today until the day of his death, you must be extremely mindful to act very friendly and caring towards your husband. Do not argue with him or undermine him. Defer to his every call. Treat him like a king.\u201d\n\nMei-Ling was ecstatic! She finally could get rid of her dictator of a husband. She thanked Mr. Zhang profusely and went home with a skip in her step to plot the murder of her malicious husband. \n\nDays, weeks, and months went by, and like clockwork, Mei-Ling served her husband a delicious dinner with the herbs mixed in everyday. She kept what Mr. Zhang said about avoiding suspicion in mind, so she bit her tongue and controlled her temper, deferred to his judgment, submitted to him without pushback, and treated him with love, care, kindness and respect. After a year had passed, the entire household had changed.\n\nMei-Ling had practiced biting her tongue and controlling her temper so much that she realized she stopped feeling angry or upset at all. She hadn\u2019t had an argument with her husband in nearly a year because he seemed so much kinder and easier to get along with. Her husband\u2019s attitude towards Mei-Ling completely changed, and he began to love, care for, and cherish her like how she always dreamed a husband would. He kept telling his friends and family that Mei-Ling was the best wife that one could ever find. Mei-Ling and her husband were now treating each other like a real husband and wife. Their children and her in-laws were very happy to see what was happening.\n\nOne day, Mei Ling ran to Mr. Zhang\u2019s shop and begged him for his help again. She cried, \u201cPlease Mr. Zhang, I\u2019m begging you to make an antidote to keep the poison from killing my husband! He\u2019s changed into such a kind and loving husband, and I love him with all my heart. I don\u2019t want him to die because of the poison I gave him!\u201d\n\nMr. Zhang smiled and gave her a handkerchief for her tears. \"Mei-Ling, you have nothing to worry about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to improve his health. The only poison was in your mind and your attitude towards him, but that has been all washed away by the love that you gave him.\"\n\n*****\n\nWhen I first heard this folk tale, I thought, \u201cWhat a load of BS. Why does Mei-Ling have to be the bigger person? Her husband also contributed to their shitty relationship and dynamic! What if he started it? Why doesn\u2019t HE treat HER nicely instead?!\u201d\n\nAnd so I brushed this story off as a way to get young women under the thumb of their oppressors (I would have said tHe PaTrIaRcHy, but the original story was actually about Mei-Ling and her mother-in-law. I adapted this story for the RPW toolbox for a reason you\u2019ll see in just a sec). But then I found myself in a string of relationships marked with mutual contempt and disrespect, similar to Mei-Ling\u2019s in the beginning of the story. I hit a low-point in my life where I started to question if I could ever find love at all if the world was filled with mean and evil assholes.\n\nThen I found RPW, and my entire love life changed for the better. One of the biggest lessons that I\u2019ve learned from RPW is that **you cannot control or change the world.** I cannot somehow force people to stop being selfish, or mean-spirited, or straight up assholes. They will not simply stop just because I expect them to. [**The only thing I can control is myself.**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8lf7zl\/a_rule_update_everyone_thinks_of_changing_the\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter who started it. What matters most is how *we* act and react, because that is the only thing we can actually control. I realized that how well you treat others is usually exactly how well they will treat you. I became the change I wanted to see, and it worked.\n\nThere is an old Asian proverb: \"The person who loves others will also be loved in return.\"\n\n*****\n\nAnd of course, a disclaimer: this is not a justification for abuse, addiction problems, or violence.

I wanted to share a bit of advice I learned from my own marriage and also observing other women's marriages. \n\n\nOnce you marry your husband, HE should be your number one priority and advisor in life. NOT your parents. I can't tell you how frequently I see this.  A woman will get married to her husband, but she still continues to be beholden to her parents. She still continues to obey and consult her parents the way she did when she was living under their care. \n\nI did this in my own marriage. The first few years of my marriage, my husband knew I was beholden to my parents. When my parents asked me for a favor, I IMMEDIATELY sprung to action to help them. If we were running late to a family dinner, I would stress my husband out and become flustered because I could never be late to see my parents. Whenever my parents would visit the house, I would spend the whole day cleaning beforehand. When my car broke down, I would immediately think to ask my dad how to solve the problem (because this was normal for me my entire childhood). When I was sad, I'd call my mom to cry and vent instead of going to my husband. When my parents called me on the phone, I would always drop whatever I was doing to take their call, even if I was doing something with my husband. \n\nMy husband picked up on this, and it made him feel as if I valued my parents and their input more than him. It made him feel as if he was second to them. I never realized my husband felt this way, because it was normal for me to rely on my parents and I relied on them my entire life. And when I got married, that behavior didn't just shut off. I continued to be beholden to my parents without realizing it was hurting my husband's feelings and undermining him as a man. \n\nI see this frequently with other women in their marriages. One of my female friends just made her husband quit his job and move back to her home state so she could be close to her parents, because she couldn't handle living across the country and being away from them. After the move, their marriage slowly fell apart because it's obvious she needs and values her parents more than her husband.\n\nYou can still love and respect your parents and be close with them! BUT your husband should be your number one priority, and I would suggest you  take some time to examine your behavior toward your parents and see if some of your actions undermine your husband in favor of your parents. **Your husband should have no doubt in his mind that HE is your number one loyalty and that HE has your respect first and foremost, before anyone else, including your parents.**","title":"Do not be beholden to your parents after you marry your husband!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/j55b3d\/do_not_be_beholden_to_your_parents_after_you\/"}

I was an 18 year old girl - pretty picky and immature - but they seemed boring to me.\n\nAlthough, now that I\u2019m 20 and not *as* immature - I\u2019m aware that (in general) 23-38 isn\u2019t old at all, far from it. But *dating* *wise*, I\u2019d still considered 26+ to be too \u2018old\u2019 for *me* \n\nEven in my teens (16-18), the only significantly older guy I could fantasise about was Robert Pattinson. Even then, I would fantasise him as a 17-19 year old (Cedric Diggory), and not his actual age (his *actual* age being 30; he\u2019s still hot don\u2019t get it twisted lol).\n\nAt 18, the (non-existent) chemistry with older men is nowhere near the same compared to guys who were my age or near (18-23). Tbh, maybe it was me.\n\nBut at 18, being with guys around my age was so exciting. There was always this undeniable flirtatious and cheeky aura - a slight sexual tension maybe. No matter how much I tried to hide it. Even with friends. There was always this playful energy and connection. And I still have the same feelings now that I\u2019m 20\n\nBut when with older men, there was nothing. nothing lol. It was like clumpy, half-dried paint. Again, it could simply be me.\n\nI think men around my age emit this playful and cheeky aura without downplaying their masculinity. Reason being that the connection with men around my age is more fluid.\n\nPlayful and masculine. The two traits go quite well hand in hand, it\u2019s super charming. \n\nThis is obviously applicable to both sexes, but there this strong emphasis (usually emphasised by single guys I think) that young women are naturally drawn to men in their 40-70s. \n\nI\u2019ve never understood why I would be attracted to some that old, let alone want a long term relationship. I want kids lol.\n\nAnd really, this only applies to the very small % of extremely *rich* old men; even then - most women want a quiet and private life, so many won\u2019t be attracted to the idea of getting with a extravagantly rich man who is 20-40 years older.\n\nMost *respectable* rich men get married pretty young - in their 20s\/30s - and are usually quite happy with their marriage. They usually have a long-lasting marriage and a few kids by 50. \nSo they have no reason to desperately tag onto every 16-30 year old girl\/woman they come across.\n\nAn old rich man with no spouse and inconsistent relationships - scavenging for 16-30 year old women - screams *midlife* *crisis* to most women. That in itself is a red flag.\n\nAs a man begins to age, it that playful aura warps into a creepy and bland aura. \nIt\u2019s not always accurate and true; the man may be a playful, loving dad with a happy family. But he\u2019ll be perceived as boring and creepy - without context - at face value; hence why so many 16-20 year old girls\/women are quick to write older men off as creepy. \n\nIt\u2019s life, the same will happen to me. All of us. It\u2019s probably already happened. But we accept it, why can\u2019t most men?\n\nOf course some women will be drawn to older men, but that\u2019s similar how some men are drawn to older women. \n\nI feel like this topic completely excludes women\u2019s point of view (ew I sound like a feminist lol, but it\u2019s true). I say this simply because so many other women agreed with me when discussing this. \n\nBut if you look into the *male* perspective of this, you find the polar opposite. They\u2019re all truly convinced that most 18-30 year old women are most sexually attracted to 40-70 year olds.\n\nWell .... they\u2019re all okay with it until you ask them:\n\n\u2018would you let your 18 year old daughter date a 40 year old?\u2019 lol.\n\nThen it was like a hall full of stutters aha.\n\nAnyways , give me your opinion.

She has been with her boyfriend for seven years, since high school, moved across the country together, live together, and only a year ago, he was excitedly looking forward to marriage. Over the last year, though, things have fallen apart and she, a headstrong committed feminist, is finally asking for advice. I thought her experience could be a good reminder how bad things can get, and quickly, if we make certain mistakes in our relationships, and an example that even feminists can be receptive to our advice when their beliefs fail to yield returns. \n\nWhat happened a year ago? They graduated college, and she began a PhD program in philosophy with a 22k stipend. He started working as a computer engineer making six figures. Due to her commitment to the equality ideology, instead of appreciating him and admiring him for his career, she began to subconsciously resent him for it. She began bringing him down in many ways, criticizing everything he did, how he spent his free time, and even calculating the hours she spent working on her PhD to prove she works just as hard as him and as an argument for splitting house duties down the middle, demanding much from him and begrudging her own contributions. Day by day, he began laying bricks around his heart. They used to have mandatory date nights, but as his love for her began to cool, he would use any excuse to not go, and when he did, they were devoid of romance. She suggested they try something new: a mandatory \u201cromantic gesture\u201d they would trade off giving each other weekly. After a few tries, he gave that up because nothing he did was \u201cever good enough for her.\u201d As things got worse, she became more desperate. She suggested as a solution that maybe they both try for four months to be the absolute best girlfriend and boyfriend to each other possible. He said that sounded like a long time. \n\nMy advice to her: try anyway. If this was something you\u2019d be willing to do as a couple, do it on your own. Be the best damn woman you can possibly be, for as long as you can maintain it without any reciprocation. I believe that she can correct for her mistakes and recover lost ground, that the wall can be taken down piece by piece. She\u2019s scared that he won\u2019t respond the way I\u2019m predicting \u2013 and that\u2019s possible. It might be too late. But she has to realize that she cannot change him, she can only change herself, and she can\u2019t expect him to fix it, or demand that he love her the way she thinks she deserves. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d Nope, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s the point. If you are exceptional, extraordinary, generous, feminine, understanding, grateful, sweet, and loving, his attitude might shift from feeling like maybe life would be better without you, to realizing he has to step up his game to deserve such an incredible woman. And further, she will gain fulfillment and peace from loving him and giving generously for the sake of giving. Remind him why he fell in love. Why he moved across the country to be with you. Love must be given selflessly, and in service to one another, not in competition. When you find a man worthy of this type of love, shower him in it though it came from a bottomless well. If love still is not returned to you, it unfortunately might be too late, and it might be best to move on. But Helen Andelin documents many marriages in far worse condition that were saved by the woman becoming the best she can be, and awakening a powerful love in a man neither one knew existed. I have to believe it is possible. My heart aches for her, for being so misguided by modern women. And unfortunately, I think this is not unique in the slightest \u2013 I think this is how many feminism-minded couples live for years, resenting one another and themselves for not being able to make marriage based entirely on \u201cfairness\u201d work the way it was supposed to. \n\nTake a moment tonight to admire and appreciate your man extra, even if you\u2019re already in a happy, traditional relationship. It means more to him than you know. And give, generously, daily, and the return is more valuable than the world.

Someone who is willing to understand him and appreciate him beyond what he has to offer externally.

But I have no idea about the extremes of it till I started reading. Women, that happen to be ugly, don't even register as a human beings to men. They're are being constantly taken advantage of.

A lot of us may reject things like lavish gifts or labor (say he offers to carry all of the groceries in) for various reasons such as:\n\n- It\u2019s too expensive and you\u2019d rather he save the money (like going to a fancy restaurant)\n- It\u2019s not what you envisioned receiving (like a surprise road trip)\n- You want him to have the nicer piece of meat, or keep his jacket when you\u2019re both cold\n- You\u2019re worried he\u2019d be tired (for groceries, driving you to work etc)\n\nYou get the picture. I think most of the time, we reject out of love. \u201cI can drive myself\u201d you say, so he can use that time to do something for himself.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m learning that any rejection of what a man gives feels to him like a rejection of himself. He feels un-useful, that the ways of making you happy that he thought of and will happily do are not good enough.\n\nWe also reject to maintain control in a subtle way. Say he offers to spend lots of time and labor to build you a table, but you envisioned buying one from Ikea, so you reject.\n\nWe should reject things that will cause actual physical or psychological harm or significant discomfort, like if he planned a rock climbing date but you have bad knees, by all means reject it. But otherwise, go with the flow, receive his gifts and plans, maybe you\u2019ll love it. In any case, you\u2019ll get to relax and let him take the lead.\n\nWhen you graciously receive from your man, you make him feel useful, powerful even, like he can make you happy, that he\u2019s needed.

Often, this is well recieved. After all, I'm sure it must feel liberating to know that the only thing one *really* needs is to work on their looks (some more exercise here, a new skincare routine there, a shopping spree at Sephora, and my dream man will be asking me out in no time!)\n\nUnfortunately for all you ladies who believe this, I'm here to burst your happy bubble.\n\n**Part One: SMV and you**\n\nI'm sure most people reading this already know what SMV is, but for those who may not, SMV is, essentially, a person's sex appeal. It's how attractive they are, and it's generally what initially draws a man to a woman. \n\nYour SMV is based almost entirely on how you look, with the rest of it being made up of how you act. (A stunningly beautiful woman who acts coldly and cruelly is less likely to find partners than an average-looking woman who is warm and open.) Your SMV is what will get you going on dates with men, and for that reason alone, you cannot avoid that fact that your looks *are* important. No matter how funny, how intelligent, or how successful you are, these things will not make a man want to fuck  you -- and making a man want to fuck you is the first step in making a man want to marry you. But notice I said it's the *first* step, not the only one. \n\nIf you subscribe to the belief that men only care about looks and nothing else, then you must also learn to accept the fact that *everything else* about you is inherently meaningless to any prospective partner. And this is *only* the case in short-term relationships. Specifically, the kinds of relationships that lead to a lot of sex, and very little of anything else. If that happens to be all you're looking for, go ahead and keep believing that men only care about looks. But in that case, this probably isn't the right place for you.\n\n**Part Two: RMV and getting past the first date**\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to address a key point that a lot of people seem to miss: men are not just giant walking penises. Boiling their relationship desires down to something as basic and simplistic as \"I only care if she's pretty\", is essentially removing any kind of capacity for intelligent choice on the part of  a man for his prospective partner. \n\nThis is not to say that men don't care about looks -- as I mentioned above, initial attraction is based heavily on physical appearance. But initial attraction is almost entirely *sexual* attraction -- and a relationship based almost entirely on sexual attraction is a relationship that is *almost entirely sexual*. To assume that a man's attraction stops there is to assume that all he wants is the best looking living sex-toy he can find, to be replaced as soon as a newer and better model comes along. Are there some men who only want this? Yes, of course there are. But these are not the kinds of men you should be looking to date, because they aren't looking to *date* you -- they're looking to fuck you. \n\nSo if men aren't *only* trying to have sex, and if they *are* capable of making intelligent choices about their prospective partners, then does this mean that looks aren't the only things that matter?\n\nYes, it does. \n\nWhen a man is dating seriously (that is, dating to marry, dating to have children, dating to have a strong, lifelong commitment to someone) he is *aware* of the fact that looks fade; yours, as well as his. He is also *aware* of the fact that a beautiful face and a perfect body are not equivalent to good communication, to kindness, to emotional or intellectual intelligence, to patience, to any number of qualities he is looking for in a *partner*. An exceptional waist to hip ratio doesn't make someone a good mother, and a symmetrical face doesn't make someone a good wife. \n\nYour RMV (for the uninitiated, relationship market value -- what you're able to bring to a relationship to make you an attractive partner) *is* dependent on who you are as a person. Of course this means that your feminine traits are important (kindness, warmth, etc), but it also means that your general personality and accomplishments play a big role as well. Does your partner want someone who can successfully homeschool children? This means you need to be quite intelligent. Does your partner want someone who can help contribute to a high quality of life for the two of you? This means your job success is important. \n\nTo assume that a man isn't looking at *all* aspects of who you are as a person when determining if he wants to be with you long-term is not only committing a grievous error in judgement, it's also displaying a shocking level of ignorance about a man's ability to make intelligent decisions about his life and his future. \n\n**In short**\n\nYour looks are important, but your looks will fade, and every man knows this. A man doesn't pick his life partner based on looks alone, so getting caught up in the idea that you don't need to be smart, or well-rounded, or just generally capable of the things that will make you a good *partner*, in good times and bad, is short-sighted and ill-advised. \n\nSo no, men *don't* just care about your looks.

I was a wreck, really angry, mad, feeling helpless, feeling like life had lied to me in this gigantic horrible way. Why wasn't my husband treating me the way I expected? Why wasn't my life the beautiful fairy-tale that I deserved???\n\nI filed for divorce in Feb. bc things had spiraled out of control. My husband was drinking, I was yelling. He worked too much, I yelled more. The more he \"messed up\", the more controlling and mean I was. I felt like if I could just get him to listen to me, if I could control things, get him in line...\n\nI found the Red Pill when I was living in a hotel room with my toddler and a mountain of fear. I was really angry when I first read it and frankly, I still get upset about it. Accepting the red pill makes me look at myself in a clear light and that's so much harder than just blaming my husband and the world. \n\nThings I've learned about myself:\n\n1. I MUST cultivate an aura of being pleasant and nice to be around. That bossy, bitchy attitude that works well for the corporate woman on t.v. doesn't work well in real life. No one likes her, and as a result, her life sucks. I've been in trouble countless times at work and at home for being a total jerk. It's too late at my work to save the relationship. I already wrecked it. Thankfully, my marriage isn't totally gone. I notice that when I shut my mouth, smile, and allow things to happen, it works out really well, even if it isn't what I \"planned\". \n\n\nCase in point: this weekend, my husband (yes, we are working things out), went out and bought a ton of lights for the kitchen and a motion sensor light to come on when I walk into the kitchen. Pretty sweet, right! He starts working on it, and after awhile, couldn't figure out one part of it. He said, I can't figure this out, I've tried everything...I'll finish later. Usually that's when I would get super mad bc that's the usual way things work, he starts a cool project, hits a wall, and stops, and I get angry that things are left undone. I said OK baby, thank you for doing that. It's so cool! And went back to making dinner...\n\n\nand he went back to finishing the project! Once again he hit a wall, couldn't figure it out, and said, I can't fix it, I'm so sorry. I said, don't worry about it! Thank you for doing all that. And...he kept working. It was unbelievable! I was thinking...wow! This works! Being nice makes him want to help!!!\n\n\n2. Time management. \nI haven't figured this one out yet, or rather, I'm still falling victim to a lot of laziness. I've stopped the netflix (yay!) and it's amazing what amount of cleaning\/organizing\/work I can accomplish in the same time it takes for a 30 min show! I still read reddit far too much, but I feel like some of it is still really important to my growth as a woman. I read Red Pill A LOT - which leads me to my third point. \n\n\nThis is humbling. I'm not proud of it. \n\n\n3. AWALT. Including me.\nI filed for divorce bc I was sick of the marriage and wanted a new life. I fantasized non-stop about the amazing man that \"I deserved\" and that was surely waiting around the corner to, as they say on red pill, captain save a ho. Um...yeah. I turn 31 this August, I'm attractive, but not toned, cuss too much, and my career is underwhelming (I focus a lot on my kid and my home life, which is good) Slowly, I started to see that...\n\n\nI have a husband that loves me and our child and makes a ton of money. He works all the time, but our life is extremely comfortable, and he treats me like a queen. Why am I walking away from that? Yeah, he drank too much, that was not O.K. and that boundary has been established and he isn't drinking like that now. Yes, I yelled constantly, and was super mean to him, calling him nasty names and emasculating him constantly. Hard to accept that dark side of myself, but it was the truth. \n\nThe choices now make me feel a bit disappointed in myself for \"settling\" but I'm making a logical, reasonable decision when it comes to RP philosophy. Hollywood glamorizes women like me racing out, divorcing the husband, taking maximum cash, and saddling up to the next guy that walks by. \n\nReally, in the real world...it doesn't work like that. There aren't amazing men in the wings just waiting to get involved with divorced women raising a child alone. I mentioned earlier how important my daughter is and how much I value that time with her. Marrying\/dating someone else would only infringe on our time together and it would take my daughter's dad further out of her life than he is now (he literally works constantly and is gone for weeks at a time on projects). Staying together isn't the easier choice, it's humbling, and embarrassing bc I told so many friends all the \"wrongs\" he did...so many of my friends can't understand why I would stay with him. The hamster is strong. YOU DESERVE BETTER! \n\nYes, I do deserve better, and so does my husband. \n\nThat's why I'm focusing on my own self improvement. Being nice, managing my time better, being grateful for this second chance, and trying to remember that AWALT (including me!) when my own hamster goes into overdrive and I want to send nasty texts or blame my husband when things go bad in my own life due to my own actions.\n\n\nOne final story. I play kickball and it's competitive. I love it. Plenty of the wives are on the sidelines drinking while we play, (I'm on a co-ed team), and one in particular stands out. This woman is about 27, with a child that's 5 (no dad in the picture on that one), and she \"got pregnant\" with a total Alpha who is on our team and he has completely been supportive of her, the baby, as well as the first child. It's truly incredible to see it. She went from broke and struggling, clinging to him, to him getting her a new ride. \n\nAnyway, is she grateful? Is she cheering him on and happy as a clam? NO. SHE ISN'T. She's on the sidelines getting DRUNK, every single game, and complaining that being a mom is so hard. It's baffling when you know the red pill and you see things as clearly as they really are. Anyway, on this particular day, she's a few beers in, talking nasty to her older child, and everyone on the team is deciding where to eat after the game. Some are going to a far away restaurant and some are staying closer by. Her hubby, and about half the team, want to stay closer by, but she flips out bc her girlfriend is going to the farther away place. \"We never go anywhere I want to go!!\" she says. He stays calm, where do you want to go? what about pizza? \"NO!! We eat pizza all the time!!! (wow, she doesn't cook and stays at home?) Repeat the back and forth as the rest of us are silent. Then she says, I'm leaving! Takes the stroller, yells at the older kid, and starts walking angrily. He follows.\n\n\nOne of the other guys on the team (Alpha dude) says \"he's going to get an earful in the car.\" His girl says, why? what did he do wrong? \nGuy says, \"it's not what he did. It's about how she feels about herself.\"\n\n\nThat was a real breakthrough for me. All those times I was angry, and all the times I get angry now, I try to center myself and say, who is this anger about? It's usually myself being disappointed in my own actions. Hard to accept, but for me, it's the truth.\n\n\nThanks for all the advice out there, ladies. I might not be where I want to be as a RPW now, but I can see that each day I AM getting to a better place with myself and my own actions. I hope to one day have a FR that says all positive stuff, and I can say Look! Figured it all out, yay! Not there yet, but getting there.\n\nOne step at a time.

I like to get words of affirmation, while he prefers spending time together and physical touch. It also doesn't help that he is really careful with his words and usually says very little, but meaningful things. I was telling him several times a month that I need more compliments and comments of gratitude, but it never happened (or were low-effort), so I got a bit frustrated.\n\nToday I made us really tasty breakfast, he was quiet as usual but instead of me saying stuff like 'why didn't you say at least thank you?' or something along the lines, I just STFU. He then suggested that we should sit in the sun outside, drink tea, and he even prepared a chair for me. Then he said he has a very important presentation at work which he was preparing for the whole night and is tired, so I hugged him and caressed his head saying nothing. When we finished drinking tea, he picked me up and carried me to the door, still saying nothing, but I found it endearing. \n\nThat's when all the RPW knowledge, Fascinating Womanhood and Surrendered Wife finally clicked in my head. Before I was too focused on the thought that he is only giving me \"his part of his love language\" and rarely the one I find the most important, but this situation made me realize that I got more out of it than I could imagine. If he only said 'thank you sweetheart for the awesome meal', I would feel good for a couple of seconds and forget about it. If I stopped him and demanded a thank you, he would feel resentful and give me a half-assed thank you that wouldn't even make me feel good because I forced it. Instead, I was patient, was happy to just be there and got a priceless reward that still makes me smile when I think about it.\n\nThank you for reading this, and I hope my experience can maybe help someone put things into perspective :)","title":"Patience with different love languages aka 'the STFU rule in practice'","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/tmg5m9\/patience_with_different_love_languages_aka_the\/"}

The man agreed. Upon seeing him again, Ben noticed that the man was much kinder and friendly to Ben then ever before.\n\nAsking someone for a favor makes them like you more. \n\nThis has held up across a few studies now. My husband explained it as this: \n\nIf someone asks you for something, and you comply, the brain rationalizes that you must have agreed because the asker is a person worth doing favors for. You instantly see them in a better light.\n\nWhen I act in service to my husband, my brain thinks I must be expending effort because he's high value. I then think better of myself, because I am with a man I respect. I'm so happy to be with a HVM and what that implies about me as a woman, that I'm inspired to find more ways to show my affection, and the cycle continues.\n\nThe inverse of this is likely true as well.\n\nTake a woman who's cheated on her husband, for example. Her brain will then rationalizes her husband as being gross and unattractive. It does this to protect the woman's ego.\n\nShe has to think of her behavior as his fault, because what she did was awful, and we don't feel good about doing awful things to people.\n\nWe don't want to think we would be bad to good people. We also don't want to think we would be kind to people who aren't worth the effort.\n\nSo our brains don't let us. They step in, altering our perceptions of others to reflect how we treat them.\n\nTherefore, a woman wants to be happier with her partner, I suggest to stop trying to improve him. Improve how you treat him.\n\n###Side note\n\nRecently, my husband remarked that my treatment of him made him feel better about himself. His brain rationalized me being nice to him as him being someone deserving of my kindness.\n\nHe says he feels more confident and more inspired to improve himself. That wasn't my intention, but it's a lovely unintended consequence.\n\nLots of happy feelings all around! Thought I would share. I do think a big part of why this can work for me is because I know my husband is a HVM regardless. I'm increasing my estimation of him, but the quality was already there.","title":"A Simple Way to Like Your Man More","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/w65oo9\/a_simple_way_to_like_your_man_more\/"}

I completed my BA, resolved some health issues, and explored my passions. I trained to be a yoga teacher, and traveled. I met a man when I was 25 who checked every box. He was looking for a wife and future mother of his children and pursued me intentionally with this purpose.

Some gentleman decided today to pull it out of the history and explain why it's wrong. \n\nBut it's not. In the years I've been modding here, I've seen this come up again and again. Men want to tell us that everything is great that *their preferences* are what matters and they would date us.\n\nWell that doesn't help. We aren't looking to date them and if someone is coming in with dating issues then \"you are perfect\" doesn't really help. Some of these thirsty dudes will insult our boyfriends and husbands as though that is the start of good advice. Some will insult us because we *aren't* their preferences. This is just as irrelevant as the unwarranted praise.\n\nMen should be here as teachers of RP theory. This is where the advice should spring from. They should be older and experienced with *relationships*. Everyone else should be focusing their time on themselves or other men.\n\nWe don't give warnings, we give bans. This and the rules and the sidebar are the warnings. \n\n****\n\n**The Original Post**\n\n\nGuys have terrible advice for women. I see it time and time again, and you're all terrible shit at this.\n\nThere's a reason. Guys rationalize bad decisions and past decisions as \"preferences.\" I won't dig up the quote right now, but Rollo made a very good point to this theme: Guys will have a preference for whatever worked before. If nerdy chicks show interest in a guy, he will gain a preference for nerdy chicks.\n\nThis isn't because nerdy chicks are necessarily sexier or more feminine, but because guys come from an essentially needy position. A position of no abundance.\n\nOn TRP we focus on abundance mentality to try to subvert this natural disadvantage, but it's true. Guys will never, ever, have as many options as women.\n\nSo when I hear a guy tell a woman, \"No, you keep doing what you're doing, I like a woman with a little spunk..\"\n\nThis guy doesn't have a preference for \"spunk.\" No, he's an idiot who is so thirsty he'll take any woman he can get, and he'll accept her self-proclaimed handicaps as features.\n\nHe'll think to himself, \"gosh, she's bitchy, rude, and abrasive..... well, I like a strong independent woman.\"\n\nAnd that's his rationalization. Because he's a thirsty fucking idiot.\n\nBut when they start preaching about their preferences as though it's going to be useful advice for women, then we've got a problem.\n\nAnd we do have this problem here. Guys think they know what good advice for women is.\n\nWomen, if you take this advice- \"i find book smarts to be very attractive\" I promise you will waste a considerable amount of time and energy doing something that doesn't really boost your SMV. Oh sure, some guys might say they have the preference, but ultimately, book smarts aren't actually sufficient to create attraction, nor required for said attraction to exist. Guys will not assist you in actual SMV building. Because, guys want to fuck you anyway, and will basically accept you as you are. But that doesn't help your chances with higher quality guys.\n\nIf you're a dude, and you think you should be chiming in, read the fucking side bar. Then read it again. Then don't chime in.

I rejected feminism beliefs and sincerely thought that I have to cater for a man and somehow submit to him. I have done everything I could in order to make myself more attractive and be with a man I love. I have lost weight, become the fittest I have ever been, look insanely attractive (according to what men have told me), tried to focus more on nurturing and caring for people in need, rather than investing in a successful career. Although I have all the resources in order to create the latter, I have rejected doing so, because I know it would end up stealing my time I could dedicate to a potential husband and children.\n\nHowever, here I am. Another year, same story. Plenty of messages received on how awesome I am, but that's about it. Despite all my efforts, I am still single as fuck and no potential partner that I like anywhere to be found. Sure, I met a couple of amazing guys I immediately saw myself with, but they turned out to be already in relationships, as probably to be expected, so I abandoned any thoughts.\n\nWhen analysing the bigger picture, all that makes me happy, all that gives me a purpose in life, all that gives me confidence in myself is actually my job. It's the accomplishments, the obtained goals, the money I have earned, everything I did by myself is what gives me comfort. I didn't want it to be like this, but I didn't have a choice. I have two paths: either sit around and be depressed because I have no man in my life or just be content with everything I achieved and keep going.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed, contrary to my beliefs, is that a lot of man seek a woman with a drive to build a career, to be independent, to be on her own. I often hear of successful men who are scared by the thought of a woman depending on them or orbiting around them. Also, intelligent men whom I have talked to seem to want a woman who is occupied with something apart from house chores or children.\n\nThere is nothing I wanted more than a loving and nurturing husband, beautiful children whom I could educate and a lovely house, but I find myself questioning if this is actually real or a fairytale lol.","title":"I'm beginning to question my red pill identity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/k7rnds\/im_beginning_to_question_my_red_pill_identity\/"}

They would have dedicated their formative years to self-improvement and self-sufficiency, becoming proficient in the domestic arts, cultivating their feminine wiles, developing a unique and exquisite personal style, and saving themselves for the exceptional men who would become their husbands.\n\nAlas, we do not live in this perfect world. Many stumble upon the Red Pill after the prime bloom of youth has been wasted on FWBs and focused purely on material success at the expense of personal happiness. Just as TRP newbies experience an \u201canger phase,\u201d new RPWs often experience a \u201cguilt and shame\u201d phase when finally awakened to the reality of male and female relationship and sexual dynamics.\n\nThis post is intended to offer hope and guidance for any lady who wants to implement the RPW philosophy in her life but feels she may have arrived too late.  This is the **first of a series of posts,** and will be most applicable to ladies **ages 25 and up.** The first few posts will focus on single ladies; future posts will be dedicated to women who are married or in LTRs.\n\n***\n\n**First, what are your motivations for wanting to be an RPW?** If it\u2019s because being on your own is too difficult and exhausting, and you just want someone to take care of you, then you\u2019re in the wrong place. *The most challenging thing about becoming an RPW is changing your focus from what you can get out of men to what you can offer them.*\n\n\n**Second, let\u2019s take hard look at \u201cthe Wall.\u201d** TRP defines the Wall as the point in a woman\u2019s life (22-24 years old, if you ask Rollo Tomassi) when her SMV begins to decline.\n \nIn reality, most women do not wake up as undesirable hags on the morning of their 25th birthday. When and how quickly your SMV declines depends largely on factors within your control. Do you live a clean lifestyle and are mindful of your health and physical appearance, like [Rachel McAdams](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/8e\/Rachel_McAdams_3.jpg\/220px-Rachel_McAdams_3.jpg)? Or did you burn yourself out with smoking, hard drugs, binge drinking, and reckless behavior, like [Lindsay Lohan](http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/blogs\/the-juice\/lindsay-lohan-face-1.jpg)? \n\nFrom the RPW perspective, what the Wall actually represents *is a fundamental shift in power dynamics between men and women whereby the value of a man\u2019s ability to provide commitment begins to exceed the value of a woman\u2019s ability to provide access to sex.* This is why the guys you met in college were willing to transition from FWB to boyfriend, but the mature and established men you\u2019re meeting now are unwilling to commit to you just to secure sex on tap.\n\n*It\u2019s imperative to adjust your dating strategy to emphasize your RMV.* What qualities do you have that are truly unique and remarkable? How will being in a relationship with you make his life better? In what areas are you fundamentally compatible?\n\nThe one advantage that you have over the younger bodies you may be competing with in the dating marketplace is that, at this point in your life, you should be secure and self-aware enough to be able to answer these questions and use your knowledge to hold a man's interest beyond the initial attraction phase.\n\n\n**Third, how do you deal with your n-count?** Other than the Wall, there is perhaps no subject discussed in this forum that gets us ladies riled up more than n-count. If any talk of the \u201ccock carousel\u201d makes you feel defensive or doomed, know that *just because you can\u2019t re-write your past doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t control your present and future.* This means learning how to vet properly, controlling your impulses, and enjoying the rewards of delayed gratification.\n \nIf a man considers your n-count a deal-breaker, move on and don\u2019t hold it against him. You\u2019re not the right woman for him. If, on the other hand, a man expects no-strings-attached sex because you\u2019ve done it in the past, you\u2019re under no obligation to acquiesce. He\u2019s not the right man for the woman that you are trying to become.\n\nOn the plus side, the older you are, the less likely you are to meet men who will outright ask you how many men you\u2019ve slept with in the past. But that doesn\u2019t mean that men won\u2019t judge your sexual history in other ways. Have you cheated on your past partners? Were you ever a sidepiece? Were you ever pregnant? Do you have any children out of wedlock? Do you have or have ever had any STDs? Did you ever have sex with someone to advance yourself at school or work?\n\nIf confronted with these questions (either directly or in a roundabout way), you need to be upfront and honest\u2014both with yourself and your prospective partners\u2014about what you did, what led you to make such poor choices in the past, what you\u2019ve learned, and most importantly, what you\u2019re doing to prevent making such choices in the future. \n\nYes, this means some guys might \u201cnext\u201d you. But a willingness to be vulnerable and selfless, and not try to manipulate and control your partner\u2019s feelings and reactions by lying or withholding information, is a necessary part of becoming the type of woman a man can love and trust. \n\nBesides, women who actually take responsibility for their mistakes instead of blaming men and society are in such short supply these days that some men might find such frankness and self-reflection to be rather refreshing.\n\n*** \n\n**Coming up soon:** [For Single Ladies \u201cLate to the Red Pill\u201d Part II: Nun Mode, Realism vs. Settling, Vetting Mistakes](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/7j5g00\/for_single_ladies_late_to_the_red_pill_part_ii\/)","title":"For Single Ladies \u201cLate to the Red Pill\u201d Part I: Motivations for being RPW, Facing the Wall, Dealing with N-Count","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/7gqsmu\/for_single_ladies_late_to_the_red_pill_part_i\/"}

This is the second of a series of posts, and will be **most applicable to ladies ages 25 and up.**  Future posts will be dedicated to women who are married or in LTRs.\n\n***\n\n**First, I must sing the praises of \u201cNun Mode,\u201d** which is a period of time (minimum 6 months) dedicated to self-improvement during which a woman completely foregoes dating. As with TRP\u2019s [\u201cMonk Mode,\u201d](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheRedPill\/comments\/2qfw0e\/guide_to_monk_mode\/) the purpose is to obtain self-awareness and self-sufficiency.\nIf you\u2019re pushing up against The Wall, you might think that you can\u2019t afford the time spent in Nun Mode. I say that you can\u2019t afford not to go into Nun Mode. In particular, there are two problems that Nun Mode can help overcome:\n  \n* If you have a history of serial monogamy (or what TRP would call \u201cmonkey-branching\u201d), each man you choose may simply be a reaction to his predecessor. For example, if your last boyfriend was an unemployed party boy, a guy who is a teetotaler workaholic might at first be attractive and refreshing, until you get frustrated with the fact that on the rare occasions he takes you out on a date, he glares at you for ordering a glass of wine. \n* After a constant stream of heartbreak and disappointment, dating will start to feel like a desperate and tedious chore, akin to going on job interviews when your rent is already a month past due. You start to wonder [\u201cwhere have all the good men gone\u201d](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen\/) when the reality is that you wouldn\u2019t know them if you saw them.\n\nThe space, self-care, and learning experiences provided by Nun Mode are essential to fixing a broken \u201cpeople picker.\u201d You will be able to consciously choose a partner based on his individual merits, love him for who he is (not the gap you\u2019re trying to fill), and spare him the trouble of repenting for another man\u2019s sins. Moreover, time spent out of the dating market can help recapture the sense of joy and excitement that you used feel as a young girl at the prospect of meeting new people and falling in love.\n\n**Second, one area that seems to be troublesome for RPWs (and those late to RPW in particular) is understanding the difference between being realistic about the type of man with whom you can be in a relationship and \u201csettling\u201d for a subpar mate.**\n\nBeing realistic is about being able to clearly and objectively assess both value and liabilities you bring to a relationship, and being able to manage your expectations accordingly. For example, if you\u2019re 37 years old, you shouldn\u2019t severely limit your dating pool by disqualifying men who have been married before or have children. If you like cookies more than the gym (and your waistline reflects this), you shouldn\u2019t hold your breath waiting for shirtless Adonis who jogs by you every morning to ask you out and instead consider a coffee date from the cute but paunchy dude who chats you up in line at the bakery.\n\nSettling, on the other hand, is done completely from a place of fear and is often based on low self-esteem rather than an objective assessment of your value or circumstances; it almost always just another exercise in poor judgment. One example of settling would be staying with a guy who habitually cheats on you because you\u2019re a single mother and you\u2019re simply grateful to have a man who is willing to be with you, despite the fact that you\u2019re modeling an unhealthy relationship to your children, and you can\u2019t effectively parent while in a constant state of anger and anxiety.  Another example of settling is dating a man with a string of baby mamas because you feel like your biological clock is ticking and you\u2019re desperate to have a child, regardless of whether he is an optimal choice of co-parent.\n\n*I will even go so far as to say that even if you\u2019re a spectacular train wreck by any reasonable measure*\u2014 for example, you\u2019re a unemployed crack addict with four kids by four different men, are host to a variety of STDs, and have an unmanaged personality disorder to boot\u2014*then you still shouldn\u2019t settle for any guy who would settle for you.* If you\u2019re *that* far gone, do yourself and humanity a favor by being alone and focusing on becoming a safe and productive member of society.\n \nThe distinction between realism and settling tends to get the muddiest when dealing with one particular area of a relationship: sex. What do you do when you find a guy who is \u201cgood on paper\u201d (i.e. great job, kind, loved by your friends and family, conventionally handsome), but for whom you feel no passion?\n\nYou might see it as a sign of maturity that you\u2019re prioritizing other qualities (like hard-working, family-oriented, gets along with all your friends) over sexual attraction, but you\u2019re actually being selfish and demeaning when you settle for a man that you don\u2019t desire.  To reiterate a statement from my first post, **the most challenging thing about becoming an RPW is changing your focus from what you can get out of men to what you can offer them.** Do you really think that a man you don\u2019t lust for or with whom you don\u2019t enjoy sex is going to get the best you have to offer in a relationship?\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that you should follow the tingles in your vagina and nothing else. In fact, if your tingles have consistently led you toward douchebags, you need to sort that out while in Nun Mode. Instant, fiery attraction often burns out the quickest, which is why it\u2019s worth taking some time with someone new and promising to see if an enduring passion might ignite.\n \nBut it\u2019s safe to say that if you\u2019ve been on several dates with a guy and his kiss doesn\u2019t excite you or you\u2019re not actively fighting the urge to eat the buttons off his shirt, do him and yourself a favor and move on. While it\u2019s possible to reinvigorate passion that\u2019s been lost in a relationship, you can\u2019t bring back what was never there.\n\nFor further reading on this point, I must recommend [\"Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough\" by Lori Gottlieb](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Marry-Him-Case-Settling-Enough\/dp\/045123216X\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1513027359&sr=8-1&keywords=marry+him+the+case+for+settling+for+mr.+good+enough). Yes, the title mentions the word \"settling,\" but what she's actually describing is how to set realistic expectations for what to expect in a mate, and not demanding that your spouse fulfill your every mental and emotional desire. Like, so what if your husband doesn't share your passion for crocheting. Don't you have friends for that?\n\n**Lastly, I will address two common mistakes that women make when they\u2019re vetting.** There are hundreds of possible mistakes, of course, but these seem to be the most common to \u201colder\u201d women:\n\n* They put things in their dating profiles like \u201cI don\u2019t want a liar or a cheater,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t play games,\u201d \u201cPlayers need not apply,\u201d \u201cAbusers not wanted,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just looking for a good man.\u201d Even if they\u2019re not online, they will say this stuff to a guy on a first date. \n\nThey think that by saying this, they\u2019re scaring away the bad men. The effect is actually the opposite\u2026 they\u2019re advertising the fact that they\u2019re damaged women with consistently bad judgment, which will attract precisely the type of men they\u2019re hoping to repel. They spill blood in the water and then are bewildered when they\u2019re attacked by sharks.\n\nAt the same time, decent men will read\/hear statements such as the above, and (rightfully) conclude that the woman is bitter and has a ton of baggage with which they would rather not deal. Why date her when he can find a woman with a positive outlook who won\u2019t immediately think the worst of him? Alternately, he might think that *she* is the one who is actually a drama queen, cheater, or abuser, and is projecting her own flaws on to the men she dates.\n\n* Other women develop an increasingly long and arbitrary list of disqualifying factors that are completely unrelated to the fundamental of compatibility, such as shared values and a shared vision for the future. These are things like, \u201cI can\u2019t date a guy who makes less than six figures,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t stand how he sings in the shower!\u201d\n\nIn my personal opinion, women who do this are actually deeply insecure with themselves or have suffered from repeated rejection, so they invent flaws with every guy they meet and try to convince themselves (and others) that they are just \u201ctoo picky.\u201d It\u2019s also a tactic to avoid any kind of painful but necessary circumspection. \n\nOf course, more often than not, all these \u201crequirements\u201d for a mate go out the window the minute they are lovestruck by Chad. Months later, when they\u2019re back online, they write \u201cI don\u2019t want a liar or a cheater!\u201d in their dating profile.\n\nSo how can you recognize a good man when you see him? The first thing to keep in mind is that people who are scumbags aren\u2019t just scumbags in one area of their life; their duplicity and\/or propensity for cruelty shows up in areas completely unrelated to romantic relationships. Here are some things to consider, though this list is by no means exhaustive:\n\n* Does he follow through on his promises and obligations to others?\n* Does he have integrity in his business and financial dealings? Or does he use illegal, unethical, or deceptive tactics to advance himself?\n* Have you ever caught him lying?\n* Does he talk down to people he regards as beneath him, such as employees or waitstaff? Or is he courteous to everyone regardless of their station?\n* Does he omit things to avoid arguments? Or is he honest with you even when he knows you might get upset?\n* Is he constantly overcompensating in order to impress people? Or does he seem comfortable in his own skin?\n* Does he rush to the aid of a stranger or acquaintance in need at the expense of people close to him? Alternately, does he seem completely selfless and generous with people he doesn\u2019t know well, but less so with people close to him? Or does he reserve his time and resources for those closest to him?\n* Does he give off a \u201csingle vibe\u201d with other women, or is he good at asserting boundaries?\n* Does he [\u201clove bomb\u201d ](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Love_bombing) you or push to take the relationship to a serious level too early in the relationship? Or does he behave as if his commitment has value, and wants to get to know you well?\n* Do his friends cheat on or otherwise mistreat their partners? Or does he surround himself with men who are in strong relationships and cherish their lady loves?\n* Does he harp on the fact that all his exes were \"crazy\" or betrayed him? Or is he restrained in how he talks about his exes on the very rare occasions he mentions them at all?\n\nThe takeaway here is that men of good character demonstrate this to everyone, not just the women they\u2019re trying to date. They don\u2019t engage in virtue-signaling; being kind and respectful is just a natural part of their character, so they never even think to advertise it. Just as \u201cI don\u2019t want an abuser!\u201d is a red flag to men, \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy\u201d and \u201cI want to treat a woman right\u201d should be a red flag to women.\n\n***\n\nMany thanks to \/u\/LaceandSilks for making sure that the RP theory was on point before I posted, and for \/u\/girlwithabike for her feedback and getting my butt in gear to finish writing this.\n\nNext: [For Single Ladies \u201cLate to the Red Pill\u201d Part III: Finding Your Man, Showing Your Value, Vetting Your Friends](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/7ltc5r\/for_single_ladies_late_to_the_red_pill_part_iii\/).

I won't engage in this off-topic discussion here.\n\nWe discuss fertility here a lot and it's *usually* unproductive and often anecdotal. I thought I'd share an issue I've wanted to highlight for some time.\n\nI met my husband when we were 27 and 30 and we married at 29 and 32. Children were a nonnegotiable but we wanted to enjoy a year or two as a married couple, before trying. We hadn't lived together while we were dating and knew that the whole \"husband and wife\" thing would take some adjusting. We wanted to own a home before we started a family. My husband had left oil, at my request, hoping to move up with the city. We had a lot of things we wanted to do together, things that would be more fun and easier without kids. We didn't want to wait *long*, but since I was only 29, we did plan to wait for a year and a half to two years.\n\nI ran this plan by my gynecologist, asking if I should revise. She assured me that she thought I'd be fine, since I had no indicators of fertility troubles. I asked about the miscarriage I had in my teenage marriage and she told me that that just meant I could get pregnant. I shouldn't worry... and so I didn't. For the next year and a half, my husband and I took an Alaskan cruise for our honeymoon, canoed on the Buffalo River, bought a house, took trips to Colorado Springs and Fort Worth, went to parties with friends, and improved our home. We had a *blast*, but knew that time was precious, so just before Christmas of 2018, I had my IUD removed and we decided to see what happened.\n\nBy April, we were aiming for those few days a month. By June, I was using ovulation strips. By September, I was starting to worry, but my doctor insisted it was probably fine and I should just stop trying. **Y'all, I cannot stress enough how glad I am that I ignored this** ***terrible*** **advice.** My husband and I were both over 30 and we didn't want to waste any more time. We wanted a family, so we wanted answers. If those answers reaffirmed, medically, that nothing was wrong, great. We scheduled a semen analysis and had to wait until January.\n\nOn February 13, 2020, my husband came home with the news that he had barely over 1 million sperm and the average is 40 million. Our only option was IVF. He didn't even have enough for an IUI (artificial insemination), unless we wanted to use donor sperm, something neither of us wanted and which didn't offer great chances with a 10-15% success rate (IVF was more like 60% in our case). We were devastated... and then a pandemic hit.\n\nI'll end the story there. If you'd like to read the rest, I do write a blog and opened a page specifically for my infertility journey. It's not uplifting, since I wasn't sure how things would end, but it *does* have a happy ending and I hope someone out there finds comfort in that. I've posted a link.\n\nMy husband and I were lucky, I suppose. Our first IVF cycle was an utter failure, but we tried again immediately and marked the one year anniversary of our first cycle with one month old twins. We also have six frozen embryos and hope for more children. **The cost? $30,000, to date.** More transfers will cost more money, as will keeping our embryos frozen.\n\nMy husband's fertility issues had nothing to do with age or lifestyle. His hormone production was great and he *should* have had ideal sperm... but he didn't, due to a genetic anomaly that couldn't be fixed or explained. Of the 1 in 8 (or 15%) of couples who will suffer from infertility, in 1\/3 of all cases, the male is to blame, 1\/3 the female, and 1\/3 both. Yet, medical professionals still tend to hold the woman responsible by default. Our doctor told us verbatim that there was no point doing a semen analysis, because \"90% of the time it's the woman,\" which as I've cited, isn't even *true*. While testing a man's fertility is relatively simple, it's largely ignored and women are often expected to undergo expensive and invasive tests first. We weren't the exception. We just refused. When we found out that my husband's sperm count was *so* low, however, there were no options... and for some reason, this isn't being widely studied, despite the statistics. My husband would have loved to try some form of treatment, but none existed.\n\nAnother consideration for men's fertility (which fortunately did not affect us), is the impact of paternal age on fetal development. While women  have grown up hearing about their biological clock for centuries, people are only just beginning to discuss the repercussions of men fathering children later. According to the Mayo Clinic, in couples where the man is over 40, there is a higher risk for pregnancy loss, rare birth defects, autism, schizophrenia, and lukemia. I'm not saying these risks are *greater* than for older women, but they do exist and should be considered.\n\nWhat I'm getting at here and maybe my **tl\/dr** is that a woman's fertility is not the only factor in planning for a family. I was relatively young and had been assured that my age was a non-issue by multiple health care professionals... *and they were right*. I was *plenty* fertile. I didn't have any cysts or polyps and my AMH results (the test that tells you how many eggs you have left), were great for my age. **I had no fertility problems, at all, while my husband would likely never be able to get me pregnant.** It was *devastating* to learn we'd have to go through IVF and, letting the pandemic pass or even lessen wasn't really an option for us, which *was* due to our age.\n\nI wouldn't change the decisions I've made. My days are filled with diapers, tantrums, giggles, and tiny matching clothes. My girls were absolutely worth it and my marriage is stronger for the struggle, even if I'm not. I'm not so sure that my marriage would have fared as well, had we taken on fertility treatments sooner and we'd have missed a lot, just the two of us. It all worked out and my husband and I are *deliriously* happy... but if we'd done things a little differently, that might not have been the case. If we'd drawn out our dating phase or our engagement or had waited even a couple more years before trying for children, because I was still young, it might have been too late, **even though my doctor gave me the green light to do so.**\n\nI don't say any of this to scare women, but to warn those who aren't worried about their *own* fertility, for whatever reasons, that *theirs* isn't the only factor. Maybe you have a May\/December thing going on and you feel like you have all the time in the world at 26, when he's 39. Maybe you're like me and your maternal grandmother had your mom at 38 and to your knowledge, fertility troubles don't run in your family. Maybe you're just super healthy and on the right course with your fianc\u00e9 and you just aren't worried, because you're only 28. I did my homework in regards to my fertility and literally no one suggested that my *husband* might have trouble conceiving or that there wasn't some pill he could take to fix the problem, so I'm telling you.\n\nMale factor infertility is a problem in 2\/3 of cases and there isn't always a solution. Take this information with a grain of salt if you want, but all the focus we put on women's fertility leaves a blind spot for both women *and* men. It's awful that something so directly involved in men's health isn't a higher priority. It's awful that women are blamed for something that is the fault of both sexes. *For me and my husband,* it would have been awful to live a life without children. **I'd also advise** ***anyone*** **starting fertility treatments to** ***insist*** **on a semen analysis before spending a** ***dime*** **on the much pricier tests for women.** Male infertility is rarely visible. My husband is quite stocky, has a full beard, a decent sex drive, and is just all man. We could have wasted a lot of time and thousands of dollars just treating me.\n\nMy infertility blog: [https:\/\/belleofinfertility.wordpress.com\/](https:\/\/belleofinfertility.wordpress.com\/)\n\nSome men's fertility resources:\n\n[https:\/\/tau.amegroups.com\/article\/view\/19367\/20196](https:\/\/tau.amegroups.com\/article\/view\/19367\/20196)\n\n[https:\/\/www.nichd.nih.gov\/health\/topics\/menshealth\/conditioninfo\/infertility](https:\/\/www.nichd.nih.gov\/health\/topics\/menshealth\/conditioninfo\/infertility)\n\n[https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/getting-pregnant\/expert-answers\/paternal-age\/faq-20057873](https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/getting-pregnant\/expert-answers\/paternal-age\/faq-20057873)\n\nWhy we don't all just adopt: [https:\/\/belleofthelibrary.com\/2021\/03\/22\/why-we-dont-all-just-adopt\/](https:\/\/belleofthelibrary.com\/2021\/03\/22\/why-we-dont-all-just-adopt\/)","title":"YOUR fertility is not the only factor.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/shbrkp\/your_fertility_is_not_the_only_factor\/"}

Everything is a learning experience. What did he enjoy, what did he not enjoy? Try to see if you can deconstruct why certain gifts appealed to him more than others. Sometimes gifts that you think will go well, don't go as well as you would like, and you want to try to understand why.\n\nThe next thing you want to do is create a designated place to jot down ideas. Wherever it is, make sure it's in a place where he won't find it. Ideally something you can carry with you everywhere you go. This will become your secret journal. Though out the year, any time he mentions wanting something write it down, anytime he is frustrated using something *write it down*, any time you see him enjoying something **write it down**. It doesn't matter at this point if they are fully formed ideas or terrible gift ideas. You don't need to worry about that right now, the important thing is you develop a large assortment of potential avenues for good gift ideas.\n\nNow that you have all these ideas, it is important to figure out which ideas are the good ones, and which ones are no good. The key question is \"what makes a good gift?\" This is a very difficult question to answer because it really depends on the person, and an understanding of what *kinds* of gifts they appreciate. What makes a good gift giver first and foremost is their ability to understand their giftee. Hopefully your list will help you with that, hopefully observing them at Christmas will help you with that, hopefully watching them through the year will help you with that. It is even okay to ask him what kind of gifts he likes, or what qualities in a gift makes him like it, just try to avoid doing that right before a gift giving holiday (it shows lack of forethought). \n\nBut, here is a general guide to different gift categories and my recommendations regarding them. Keep in mind you know your giftee better than I do, and your knowledge trumps anything written here.\n\n---\n**Buys For Himself Gifts**\n\nThese are gifts that he needs, but he also buys for himself. This is the category where \u201cboring\u201d gifts like socks and razors live. The reason these gifts are boring is because he already get him himself. He doesn't need you to buy them, and it just causes disappointment looking forward to opening a gift, and getting something he could have just gotten himself, and has on several occasion. Do not buy gifts for people that they already buy.\n\n**Collector Gifts**\n\nCollector gifts are a great idea. If he has a large collection any random item, that is a great thing to get him. Just make sure he doesn't already have that one! \n\n**Consumable Gifts**\n\nThings that he might enjoy eating are good gifts, however, alone, gifts like that can be a little bit underwhelming. If this is the only gift they get they will probably overall, be disappointed (unless it's you're new boyfriend\/guy you just started dating... in that case it's a perfect gift). Pair it with additional gifts to get better enthusiasm.\n\n**Experience Gifts**\n\nThis is buying admission or tickets to some sort of activity. Experience gifts can be a great gift idea if the event is something that you know he would enjoy. Typically small experiences are the best route, like buying tickets to a play or baseball game. Do not buy tickets for a trip to Paris or anything that you would need to make sure his schedule works for.\n\n**For \"Us\" Gifts**\n\nDo not buy anything as a gift that is meant to be for the two of you. Things like house decorations, or bedroom toys are bad gift ideas. The only exception to this might be experience gifts.\n\n**Hobby Related Gifts**\n\nHobby gifts are very difficult, because often times they just know more about their hobby than you do. If you try to get him something related to his hobby it might often fall flat because it's not quite the right thing he would have got for himself. Hobbyists know their hobby very well and they often know what things they would want better than you. Even if you know the \"exact right thing\" it will often be the expensive thing he hasn't bought for himself already because... it's too expensive. Gift cards to hobby stores may sometimes be appropriate for this reason.\n\nSometimes the best hobby related gifts are more simple ones. Instead of buying a guitar player a new guitar or amp, maybe some new guitar picks with designs selected with his interests in mind wouldn't go amiss, or a new guitar case.  Also hobby related paraphernalia can sometimes be a good gift. T-shirts with their hobby on it can be a good go-to. Make sure the stuff you buy would be things that they would actually want in the 1st place. Don't buy a guitar shaped alarm clock, if he would never want an alarm clock.\n\n**Homemade Gifts**\n\nHomemade gifts aren't really they own category, a homemade gift can fall into any one of the other categories, plus it is homemade. The rules for homemade gifts are the same as the category as the category they fall into. (For example for homemade treats follow the rules for consumable gifts). \n\nA homemade gift can be a great or terrible gift depending on the quality. A good rule of thumb is that if the quality is as good or better than the quality of the store bought one, then it is a good gift. Basically, if the quality is high enough that someone would pay for it. If the quality is high, and it is something that he would have wanted, he will be doubly impressed by your gift. If the quality is low, he will feel disappointed.\n\n**\"I Want...\" Gifts**\n\nIf you heard him specifically call out anything during the year as wanting that thing, that is absolutely a great gift idea.\n\n**Indulgence Gifts**\n\nThis gift category is things that he already enjoys or uses, but it's a nicer version of it, it also could be something that would make him more comfortable. It doesn't follow the rules of \u201cBuys For Himself\u201d because he doesn't spend that much money when he buys it for himself. Examples could be a fancy version of the wine he likes, luxurious bath towels, or a nice robe. These make great gifts because it's exactly the sort of thing that is a little bit of a \u201ctreat\u201d. \n\n**Personality Gifts**\n\nPersonality gifts are tricky, but can be fun if you get it right. Personality gifts can span a wide range, basically they are any idea that would just appeal to him personally. Examples would be something that particularly appeals to his sense of humor, or a game you think he would like because you know he is fond of strategy games. Personality gifts require of really good understanding of who you are buying the gift for, and for that reason they are difficult to pull off. But when you get it right, it shows that you do understand him.\n\n**Upgrade Gifts**\n\nIf you notice using something far past it's expiration date, then a new version is a great idea. An item like this is an item he uses frequently and just had the time (or whatever) to replace it. Buying him a new one shows that you've noticed the poor condition of something, and you wanted him to have a better\/newer one because you care about him. Examples could be rusted tools, or garments he still wears with holes, etc.\n\n---\nNow that you have your list, and knowledge about what types of gifts would be good, turn your list into gift ideas. Not everything needs to get turned into an actual gift. Some of the stuff you wrote down will be total duds. All you need is enough to turn into gifts, until you feel the appropriate amount of gifts has been reached (I like to give more gifts if they are small and inexpensive and less gifts if they are big and pricey).\n\nThen you start preparing for next year. Personally, I like to keep all my unused gift ideas on my list for a while. Sometimes an unused gift idea could be a homemade idea that I didn't have time to execute due to how late in the year I had the idea, or it might be a gift that I was on the fence on whether it would be a good gift or not and I need more data to make a decision on, or it could be a nebulous idea that I haven't figured out how to turn into a gift yet. So, I keep old ideas around for a couple years, and continue to add new ones to my list.\n\nGood luck and happy gift giving.","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Good Gift Giving","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/kq39ru\/the_ultimate_guide_to_good_gift_giving\/"}

She teaches you to say thank you, she teaches you how to treat people with kindness. She teaches you how to be compassionate towards people, she teaches you how to be careful with your words to not cause pain to anyone. She is gentle, understanding, responsible, hardworking, morally good.\n\nThe ideal mother loves her own children even when they are difficult. She commits to them if they get into trouble, she commits to them if they fail, she commits to them even if her own children lash back at her, because the ideal mother is loyal to her children. She forgives them, and she tries her best to also forgive other people or adults who have angered her, because the goodness of a woman's heart understands forgiveness.\n\nMen search for and expect this moral goodness in women and especially in their wives. They do NOT appreciate bitchiness. They seek to find a woman with values, because they know she will be the role model for the family, the queen of the family. \n\nBe a queen.

He just rarely *surprises* me with one.\n\nI haven't been on Reddit much these last few days and still, I've managed to stumble on this post and wanted to offer my perspective:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/seg6ai\/i\\_dumped\\_the\\_guy\\_i\\_was\\_vetting\\_over\\_the\\_birthday\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FemaleDatingStrategy\/comments\/seg6ai\/i_dumped_the_guy_i_was_vetting_over_the_birthday\/)\n\nThe post I've linked above is written by a woman who told her boyfriend *not* to get her a birthday gift, because she was offended he asked what she wanted. When he ordered a bouquet of cookies for her, she broke up with him by ghosting, because he should know she eats healthy and she was so offended.\n\n1. If you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes, so don't tell a man you don't expect a gift when you do.\n2. Don't get offended if your boyfriend of six months doesn't know *exactly* what you want, especially when you claim you truly don't *need* anything, as the poster did.\n3. If you say no gift and are lucky enough to get one anyway, don't be ungrateful and complain! Say thank you, even if it's off the mark, *especially* if you've only been dating for six months.\n4. Even if you eat really healthy, it's totally normal for people to splurge on their birthday. Birthday cake is a thing for a reason. Perhaps a fruit arrangement would have been a better choice for this man, but the poster's reaction was way out of proportion when her guy had never experienced a birthday with her and didn't know if she let loose or not.\n5. Never break up with someone by ghosting them. It's a horrible, lazy, thing to do, especially over *cookies.*\n\nOn May 6, 2017, I married the absolute perfect man for me... and my stars is he *not perfect,* just like the woman he married. One way he's not perfect is in the gift giving department. For our first Valentine's Day, he gave me a cute jar filled with Reese's, my favorite candy. We both found the holiday a bit silly and had agreed to go small with gifts. My husband, however, didn't buy enough candy and filled up the jar with some I already had in my freezer. *He gave me my own candy*... and I thanked him and laughed. Now, it's become a cherished memory and that jar sits on his dresser, making me smile every time I see it, because sometimes good men suck at giving gifts!\n\nThis past Christmas was the first time in seven years that my husband has surprised me with a present (Edit: He, of course, buys me gifts, but I'm rarely surprised). He bought me the necklace that matched the earrings I'd asked for for my birthday and I was *elated,* because he's just not great at coming up with the perfect present. He must be too busy working hard to provide for his family, fixing things around the house, making dinner at least half the time, playing with our daughters, clearing the quarter acre of brush in our backyard, building shelves for every room of our house, picking up grocery orders so I don't have to get our girls out in the cold, chopping firewood, helping me clean, planting a garden... the list goes on and on.\n\nI married a good man, ladies. He's one of the best... and he's meh at gift giving. Even when we were dating, he opened doors, bought me dinner, planned fun dates, comforted me when I cried, made me laugh, introduced me to new things, changed my brake pads, loved on my dog, cooked for me, and that list goes on too. It just doesn't include giving me amazing presents.\n\nNow, maybe this was the last straw for this poster and she'd previously had other issues. I don't know, but the comments suggest the mindset I'm getting from the poster is at least rampant among other women. When you're in a relationship, with another imperfect being, you have to look at the whole picture. Even if gifts are your \"love language\", a concept I find to be oversimplified and likely untrue for this poster who claimed she needed nothing, your partner might not be great at giving them at the very start. People grow and learn about each other and sometimes... they just come up short in some areas. No one is perfect, but regardless, in the face of any gift given with good intent, gratitude is the best response.","title":"Sometimes good men give bad gifts.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/sewd31\/sometimes_good_men_give_bad_gifts\/"}

And since I'm close to my target downpayment, my husband and I went to look at vehicles this past weekend. We settled on one car, which will be the most expensive and luxurious car I have ever owned. \n\nI am frugal, so I wanted the base model, but my husband and I really liked the extras in the top tier one. My husband asked me if it had everything I wanted and I told him it did, but the price gave me pause since it would increase my monthly payment past what I wanted to pay per month. \n\nSo we got out of the car, and went back into the dealership. When we sat down, I let my husband do all the talking to the sales guy for two reasons. One, I don't know much about cars and have very little haggling skills in that area. Two, my husband and I had already discussed things and I knew he would make the best decision for us. \n\nSo what did my husband do? He chose the top tier option and I STFU and nodded in agreement without snark or complaints. We paid a holding fee, since the car we want has to be built still, and left. Then on the drive back home, my husband surprised me and told me he was going to give me 50% of my downpayment and pay for it to get special detailing so it's extra nice when I receive it.and since my downpayment is already 50% of the car, that's no chump change. I was elated.\n\nThe old me would've argued with him in the dealership and probably told him how much of a waste the extra couple of thousand dollars was for the top tier, etc. But by respecting my husband's judgement and place as my captain, especially out in public, it paid off for me in the long run. My husband is a capable man and knew that the costlier option was affordable to us and that it would make us both happier in the long run.

This is what obligation looks like. \n\nHow many of these men are getting flowers because it's Valentine's Day, and that's the thing you do on Valentine's Day?  How many of these men are getting flowers to avoid a fight, or to avoid making her cry? How many of these men are getting flowers so that they can get laid? If they're doing it for any of these reasons, then this is an obligation to them and they have no desire to do it. \n\nNow how many of these men and are looking forward to seeing her face light up with glee when he surprises her with flowers? I'd be willing to bet that number is \"0\". When a man is not doing it for this reason, he is a beaten down man with the life drained out of him. But when he is doing it for this reason he is excited and full of life.\n\nShould you care *why* your man gets you flowers, as long as he gets them for you? Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. If your man is not happy, then your relationship is not good. Go back to RPW school until you learn this.\n\n2. If your man is happy he is more likely to get you gifts that you don't expect. He might get you flowers on Valentine's Day, or he might get you a \"I was just thinking about\" gift on a random Tuesday.\n\n3. If a man gets you flowers, and you know he didn't have to, it makes the gift *so* much better. If he did it because you told him to, it makes it more fuzzy... did he get them because you told him to, or did he really want to?\n\nThe trick to getting men to do nice things for you, without demanding them, is to make him *want* to do nice things for you. Here are the steps for showing and developing an \"attitude of gratitude\". \n\n1. Be a person that he has emotional investment in. This is your basic relationship building tactics, so go back to RPW school if you don't know how to do this.\n\n2. *Never* expect anything. I don't care if it's your birthday, Valentine's Day, Christmas or Leif Erikson day, don't expect that he gives you anything, and don't be or mad\/sad if you didn't get a present. Also, never tie sex to presents, he should be getting sex either way, on a very regular basis.\n\n3. Remember *anything* he gives you is a gift that he didn't have to give to you, and act accordingly. If he's not giving you tangible gifts, think about the intangible ones he's giving you. Spending time with you, fixing the leaky faucet, paying the mortgage, whatever. Any gift he gives you should be met with childlike delight, like you're opening your presents on Christmas morning. Smile with glee, jump up and down, kiss him, and thank him. \n\n4. Let him know if there's something you want, but don't make any sort of obligation or demand out of it. You're just giving him information, he will use it if he is so inclined.\n\nIf you're already in an obligation-based relationship, it's not too late to change it. Drop the obligatory behavior, and even directly apologize for it, and start to develop an \"attitude of gratitude\". In general, to feel entirely grateful for something, you must truly believe that it was an non-obligatory gift. If you don't have this internal gratitude belief system at first, that's okay, you can act like it. Slowly your beliefs will start to follow your behavior.\n\n*Examples*\n\n*Anecdote 1*\n\nMy SO and his best bud were planning a trip to Yosemite, and they had planned it without me. Upon finding out their plans, I let him know that I would like to come too. I was told this was just for the boys, and I let it go. After he came back from his trip, my SO admitted to me that he didn't take me along because he didn't want to feel like he \"had to\" just because I happened to be the girl that he was dating. But, when he got there he realized he missed me, and he wanted me there. So that day we began making plans to go back, just so that he could have the experience with my company. I wrote a [field report](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/29hx63\/fr_i_want_to_go\/?st=jenkemce&sh=bb7c8aa7) about the event.\n\n*Anecdote 2*\n\nI don't get a present from my SO every Christmas. He has gotten things for me some years, but not every year. I always am appreciative and excited when I get something, and always have fun seeing him open the presents I got him. This year was different. This year there was *so* many presents under the tree with my name on it. Then there was... the big present, which he carefully wrapped cunningly so that I wouldn't have a notion of what it was. When I opened this present I was truly stunned and in awe. We like to go shooting together, and I have been trying (and failing) to get expert level scores for many months. My present was a rifle, that was custom designed for me and put together all by him. He bought all the pieces on the internet, and put it together while I was sleeping. He made sure that every part was picked for me. Light weight (because I'm small), small barrel (for my tiny hands), a compensator that would reduce recoil, my favorite trigger, he even drove for hours to get it all done in purple, and then bought me a matching rifle case. He told me later that he did all this because I treat him so well, and never expect anything from him.\n","title":"The Art of Getting Things...

My husband and I are living with my parents' until our home is finished in a few months. We are *beyond* grateful and both work hard together to be perfect and respectful guests. The proximity has given me a closer look at things I wasn't able to articulate until I found this community and became a student, and realized how much work I face to fix a lot of cracks in my marriage that I've caused. \n\nI love and adore my mother with everything I have, and she is my best friend. And like all of us, she is imperfect. **More specifically, to be blunt, she is annoying.** \n\nMy mother is an expert nagger and criticizer, and the embodiment of being so for so long that she will never change, it's in her essence and has boundaries set around her with her family because of this, and that's why I say \"is\" and not \"can be.\" She clearly has needs surrounding support and companionship, but not the RPW tools to effectively get those needs fully met. Being the woman of the house, naturally I assumed that you nagged and chased and disrespected and criticized your husband into doing things, because men are lazy and aloof and need to be punished for that. I watched my mom do it my whole life, emasculating my father, and watched him withdraw further and further, and I then turned around and did the same in my own marriage in many different areas. I realize that I \"can be\" and am on the fast track to \"is.\" \n\nI have no doubt my father loves my mom and would walk through hell for her. He's not perfect either. But I've noticed, especially since moving in, he spends a ton of time apart from her, even more now that we're all older and out of the house, throwing his all into work and their out-of-town real estate ventures. It's a reflection of my future if I make it all the way to \"is.\" \n\nI know it's taboo and ungrateful to get on the internet and dunk on your mom. I don't mean to pretend to be an expert on my parents' 30+ year marriage, only a mere outside observer. It's not at all my intent to put her on a platform solely for ridicule, or even to subvert accountability with a generic \"It's all my mom's fault.\" She's not married to my husband and doesn't pull my tongue. That's on me. Rather, the mirror has helped me exponentially in answering some \"why\"s and tracing back some origins **so I can effectively address those habits at their deepest roots.** This RPW stuff is working my ass, y'all. For people like me, it's not enough to simply say \"Women are being conditioned by SoCiEtY to be like x.\" I think my culture and upbringing as a Black woman, and the unique hurdles we face with femininity, softness, and peace can (not always) be best studied through the examples our mothers set for us. That's a touchy subject for another day though. \n\nSeeing some patterns of withdrawal with my own spouse and doing better to understand why makes STFU way, way easier. Cringing when my mom disrespects my dad \"out of love\/fun\" has helped me out a ton with my own \"sense of humor.\" I better notice the way my dad deflates and shies away when she does this to him. I have an easier time these days doing self-reflection, and going \"*Ah, I was being annoying!*\" There's no value in beating ourselves up for what we didn't know of course, but there have always been aspects of my personality that have been hard to address for so long, and I love being able to call it out within myself much more freely. \n\n**Example:** I can enjoy chatting with my mom, and then feel the pit in my stomach and desire to withdraw the moment she comments on what I'm wearing. She will \"What? I'm just saying!\" every time instead of confronting the possibility that she's being unnecessary. And since learning RPW, I can better feel how my husband probably felt *as a man* when I did the same thing, even if I meant well and just wanted to \"help\/improve him.\" I can never turn my nose up at my mother because I've unfortunately replicated so much of her behavior to a T. \n\nWe see a lot of \"I wish I had known all this sooner\" here on this sub. I'm curious to know if any of you have also come to a clearer understanding of your mom, and if it's helped you get to the root of where some aspects of yourself come from. And to you lucky ones who were taught what I now have to spend time learning as an adult, I'd also love to hear how you feel that's positively influenced you in adulthood too.","title":"My mother is annoying, and it's like looking in a mirror.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/z8f7gh\/my_mother_is_annoying_and_its_like_looking_in_a\/"}

We take bad advice. We have bad upbringings. We have good upbringings and still make rash choices. Everyone has some baggage.\n\n\nThis does not make finding a mate impossible. You should not go out and buy a bunch of cats. Instead, you find someone with matching baggage.\u00a0\n\n\nI am not suggesting\u00a0you accept an unacceptable\u00a0situation. Instead, you accept less than perfection because you are not perfect.\u00a0\n\n\nMost of us are *not* going to get the ibanker pulling 7 figures a year. If that's the social circles you run in, then sure. If you are a farm girl in rural Kansas, it doesn't matter how thin\u00a0your waist\u00a0or pure your lady bits, the ibanker is a pipe dream. Thus, it does not matter what the ibanker finds attractive in a woman.\n\n\nThere are very few single qualifications that make you completely unloveable. People are multifaceted and quite willing to make trade offs in some areas to get what they desire in others.\u00a0 And you shouldn't be listening to people say \"I know the answers to what all men want\". Because 'high value' is in the eye of the beholder.\u00a0\n\n\nMost men may hate tattoos and think they are a sign of poor decision making. Some men, the ones you want tattooed-lady, will think they are sexy. But that guy probably doesn't go to the country club on weekends. Most men prefer a woman with a .7 waist to hip ratio but a guy who has a receding\u00a0hairline\u00a0might be more lenient about the fact that you aren't quite there.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are all trying to get the best man available to us. This isn't the same for everyone.\u00a0\n\n\nSo instead of trying to define 'high value' as a specific checklist\u00a0and letting others tell you what that is and what that\u00a0man\u00a0wants you to be. Find the masculine guy who makes you feel feminine. And use your feminine to make him feel masculine. And ride off into the sunset together with your matching luggage in the backseat.\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\nHere is the fine print in case it needs to be said: if you are young and have all the options in the world, make good decisions. Look at what the men you want are attracted to and work to be that.\u00a0 And if you aren't young with all the options in the world, you should still try to improve yourself so that you have as many options as possible. Options are power.\u00a0","title":"Buy matching luggage, carry it together","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/uvxs63\/buy_matching_luggage_carry_it_together\/"}

However, men seem to do this too. Or, at least, my husband does.\n\nWe have been together 10 years. I have always been a little bit on the curvier side. Never too overweight. But definitely curvier. He has always said that he loves curvy women, he loves my curves etc. He likes grabbing my thighs and things like that. Whenever he sees someone who is super skinny he always says \"I don't know what men see in that kind of body type\".\n\nNeedless to say, I work out to stay toned but never bothered to lose the extra weight.\n\nRecently, however, I've been really appreciating the RPW community and have been trying to improve myself in every single way. I'm improving how I eat and am working out more often. This has naturally resulted in my losing quite a bit of weight in the past year (10kg). \n\nAnd since then he has been obsessed with my body. I don't think I've ever seen him this turned on about my body before.

Not having my own blog and most forums and blogs are aimed at men, this seems to be the perfect place to post.\n\n\nI can't help but notice how much content is aimed at men. Everything is what a man can do to keep her interested. Well, I've worked on myself for *years* and what happens when she doesn't too? I leave her. It's that simple for enlightened men. We have options. More importantly, we *know* we have options.\n\n\nI'm going to define girl game here as something you're able to do inside a relationship to maintain his attraction and commitment. Don't think just because you already have a ring you have that commitment. We need things from relationships too.\n\n\nI'm going to assume you have found a **good** guy (Note, not nice - **good**). If you are dating an asshole that is selfish and not RP at all, dump him and find a good guy to do this stuff with.\n\nHere's a list of things you can do to improve your \"girl game\":\n\n\n**1) Be physically fit.**\n\n\nIf you're overweight start working on that right now. Seriously stop reading this and do some fucking exercise and come back and finish reading. Now. Eat less and exercise more. It's that simple. Not going to bang on about this one. You know it, I know it. We care how you look so do something about it.\n\n\n**How:** Exercise more. Eat Less. It's pretty fucking simple. You do not deserve more sweets because you did a bit of exercise. Stop that bullshit rationalizing, it's going to kill you early.\n\n**2) Blowjobs**\n\n\nTypical man, huh? Yes, exactly. \n\n\nYou have no idea how *few* women seem to *love* giving a guy head. The ones that do stand out. A lot. I'm not saying that women don't *do* it. \n\n\nThank you feminism for sexual liberation! \n\n\nIt's just the ones that absolutely love giving it that stand out. Regular, enthusiastic, blowjobs are by far the best way to show that you care to go the extra mile and actually don't mind putting in some effort yourself into sexual situations. Sex is a lot of work for us guys. It really is. Being able to just lean back as you get on your knees to pleasure us is a wonderful mixture of pleasure. You're being submissive whilst I'm relaxing, how can a guy not *love* that?\n\n\n**How:** Let him know you love pleasuring him. Don't just talk the talk on this one. The amount needs to go up too if it's less than once a week. Make it count. \n\n\n**3) Stop being aggressive and bitchy**\n\n\nWe could go find hundreds of other women less than a 10 minute walk away that are bitchy to us. We pump and dump them. That's all I want from aggressive, masculine women. Generally speaking, they're a better lay than the girly girls, but I stick around the feminine women that are a cute relaxing ball of cuteness that I just want to hold because she's so god damn cute and she just obviously needs a man there. This should be your aim. Relax out of the aggressive tone and bitchy attitude that the western world has distilled into you. It's not sexy. It makes us want to walk away. Every. Damn. Time. Russia \/ Asia looks VERY attractive whenever a woman gives us that fucking attitude. \n\n\n**How:** Just relax, it's not a big deal. Be aware of yourself. Think before you speak. Ask yourself, when was the last time he was bitchy and aggressive towards you? Men are usually not aggressive towards their partners, stop trying to be masculine with a characteristic that isn't even masculine to begin with.\n\n\n**4) Express yourself when you feel happy or content**\n\n\nIt's not weak. It's cute and quite sexy. We like it. Example quotes that could be thought but never stated:\n\n\n> \"I feel so happy when I'm with you\"\n\n\n> \"You make me feel safe\"\n\n\n> \"I wish you were a sleeping bag so I could zip you open and climb inside you and snuggle all night\"\n\n\nOk, maybe the last one was a bit too far! However I hope you get the hint. We like it when you show how you feel in a cute way. So many women feel they have to keep this private to \"maintain the upper hand\" he can't know that you care and feel safe around him! That's weak! Bullshit, we love it.\n\n\n**How:** This is pretty easy, just don't suppress yourselves so much. Don't let all the crazy out. I know you're imagining weddings and babies etc, don't go that far. Just express feelings more. You're women. You should be cute and feminine. Seeing a theme recurring yet?\n\n\n**5: Domestic Skills**\n\n\nThis is a touchy one in modern publication. We shouldn't like this. It's sexist, misogynistic etc etc blah blah fucking blah. Well, we love it. When you cook us a nice dinner from scratch. It turns something on deep inside us. You can *look after* us. We don't want a new mother; we can cook for ourselves if needs be. However, it's much sexier when you do. Seriously.\n\n\n**How:** Learn some simple recipes. With YouTube and the internet in general there's no excuse for this. Women even *brag* about their lack of cooking skills these days. Want to know what I think? Pump and dump.\n\n\n**6) Be *his* whore**\n\n\nNotice the emphasis on his? I hope you did because that bit's important. If you're already in a relationship with a guy and he's quite sexual (ha) he wants you to be *his* whore. This takes some metaphorical balls to follow through on. Be submissive, ask what he wants in a submissive way. When you get on the bed kneel and ask him what he wants you to do. Let him take you selfishly. Do what he wants (within reason, obviously never violate your own limits for someone else) and don't be scared to try new things. Let him know you're open to trying anything new with *him*. He wants you to be open about your fetishes and fantasies. I've slept with enough women to know that generally you're actually a lot dirtier than us men are. Stop hiding this. Most men believe you're sweet innocent things and therefore you won't get the sex you want. Be open and honest. Or at least show that you are open to trying new things.\n\n\n**How:** For this you need to show your submissive side. I haven't met a woman that wasn't submissive sexually however I'm extremely confident, you may need to show this yourself to get the sex we both know you crave. A couple of tips: ask him what he wants \"How do you want me?\" when he tells you, reply with a \"Yes, sir\" or a \"Yes, master\". You can thank me later after he goes primal on you.\n\n\n**7) Never talk disrespectfully about your man to anybody. Ever.**\n\n\nThis is important. \n\n\nI have dropped a potential instantly for this. Others just allow the resentment to build inside and never express it, let it eat them up and turn beta eventually. Talking bad about your man to anybody, *especially* with him sat right there, is disrespectful to him. You want a leader? Then let him fucking lead. Don't mock him publicly. This makes us men feel smaller than a hobbit. I have heard many men say that this is the only occasion they have been tempted to hit a woman. That's how much this insults us.\n\n\n**How:** Instead of joining in your girlfriend's bitch fests about their partners with the small things that may still bother you, express how happy you are instead. I guarantee they will soon start asking you for advice. This is a winner in two ways: You gain social approval for having an awesome relationship and become the go-to for advice. Your man will love you more for sticking up for him. We want you to be loyal and loving anything below that is an insult.\n\n\n**8) When we're working on ourselves as men, compliment us on it**\n\n\nI love it when I have been working out particularly hard for a few weeks and my girlfriend (oh, yeah, one has me tied up all monogamous) starts touching my arms and chest saying how big I've gotten. I know I haven't really improved as much as she's saying, I love the compliments all the same. It took a lot of hard work and dedication to get in shape. I used to be skinny as hell, less than a stick and it took more effort to gain that weight and muscle than you could possibly imagine. It's awesome and I mean *awesome* when I get complimented on that.\n\n\nThe same applies when we're working on our actual work. My field (software) requires me to self study a lot outside of work. I need to stay on top of new technologies to remain a linchpin at work. Respect the fact that he's dedicated to his work. Make it a compliment rather than a moan:\n\n\n> \"I love that you work so hard, I've got a surprise for you when you're done..\" \/\/ drop coat to show lingerie.\n\n\nDon't do this *too* often, he has to actually study to keep up to date! ...can't believe I just said that!\n\n\nOn a more off topic but slightly related note: If you want a leader, let him lead. Don't ask for him to lead and then criticize. That's a little loopy and backwards. If you can't make a decision and ask for his input: respect that decision. Don't then start mocking him. Instead, thank him and go along with it. It's hard for us men that are naturally beta to mix in those alpha traits. When you start doing this it's very hard to get into the mindset of taking the lead.\n\n\n**How:** Self evident. Just do it.\n\n\n**9) Last one, Sex.**\n\n\nI know you can't make yourself want to have sex with him. If you're not feeling it you're just not feeling it. However if this goes on too long you just end up in a fucked up rut of no fucking.\n\n\nWe **need** to fuck. I really would say it's a need. Blue-balls actually do hurt. Don't be afraid of the good old quickie. He needs to unleash inside of you on a regular basis. I (and most guys) certainly understand that you're not *always* going to be up for it. However that's no excuse for cheating him out of his relationship he's committed to. It's worse than cheating. Nobody's even getting laid. He doesn't want a friend, he wants a sexual partner. He has friends. He's not fucking them either!\n\n\nSeriously if the sexual element has been removed from your relationship for more than 4 or 5 days. Give him a quickie if you're still not feeling it. The sexual rut is very easy to get into. If he's not feeling confident because you're not looking very up for him sexually, he won't approach confidently and you won't get turned on... it gets into a viscous cycle. A quick and nasty quickie can break this cycle.\n\n\n**How:** Get over this notion that sex has to \"happen\" that some women have. Grab his cock and ask him to fuck you. If you're in a relationship sex shouldn't be something lacking at all. Ever. He will either resent you or leave. There's no other option.\n\n\n**TL;DR: Read it, I spent ages writing it up.**","title":"Game tips for women (some NSFW content)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1ssn1e\/game_tips_for_women_some_nsfw_content\/"}

I am also on mobile so please bear with me regarding formatting.\n\nI (24f), have followed the RPW sub for a little over a year, but only recently began practicing it over the last 6 or so months in my relationship once I felt I had a solid enough grasp on the theory to put it into realistic practice. I have been working on my femininity and submission in general for the last 3 years I would say, but this sub has been extraordinarily helpful in offering these ideas as tactical behaviors rather than just general concepts and ideas. I wasn\u2019t coming into a lot of RPW theory cold, but it was a refresher and a wake up for a lot of things. Some of what I\u2019d been doing in previous relationships and dating I had thought was the way to go and had been wondering why I wasn\u2019t getting the results or as strong of a reaction as I\u2019d been hoping. All of it had been well intentioned, just a bit misguided.\n\nI started practicing RPW at the beginning of my new relationship (he is 25m). We have been together for about 6 months now. I had spent the 6 months before that vetting him and learning, as stated previously, before determining he has the qualities I was looking for in a Captain. A big part of my takeaway from RPW is the recommended idea of \u201ctake what works and leave the rest\u201d. My Captain genuinely prefers a bit of sass from me, lighthearted teasing, and feistiness. These traits of my personality are actually what attracted him to me in the first place. He loves \/earning\/ my submission to him occasionally instead of me just offering it outright on a silver platter. But as with all men, this teasing and sass is never done in public in front of his friends, coworkers, or other men in general, and it\u2019s important to know when to bring this out and when he needs loving deference.\n\nOnto the big parts of theory I\u2019ve decided to put into practice.\n\nThe art of STFU. Many times in my life I have found it difficult to hold my tongue, often to no avail. Learning this form of self control, allowing him to take the lead and not offering unsolicited advice has been major for both of us. He consistently tells me how he appreciates my respect toward him and his ability to make decisions!\n\nAccepting him as he is. I\u2019ve always been someone who tried to \u201cfix\u201d people, including previous romantic partners. Until discovering RPW, I had never realized how domineering and emasculating this comes across as  I was not aware men read this as distrust and us viewing them as inadequate. Now, I offer advice only when it\u2019s asked of me, which actually ends up being somewhat frequently because he values my input and knows I believe he\u2019s going to make the right choice.\n\nComplimenting his masculinity and juxtaposing it with my femininity. Real world example, the house he lives in had no shower in the downstairs bathroom, and the basement was finished but empty. He spent two weekends installing a complete shower and turning the basement into a home theater with surround sound and a huge projector and screen. He was so excited to show me! I of course gushed to him about it and told him he did an excellent job, and how I was so happy he is such a capable man who can do things like that, is so handy, and smart enough to figure all of those things out. He spent the rest of the night beaming, and showed up at my place the next day with flowers!\n\nThere are of course many other things, both big and smaller day to day ones. But what inspired me to make this post was our phone conversation earlier. He was talking to me about some stress he\u2019s been feeling at work lately, he did not want advice, just to be heard and receive some affirmations. I told him I was proud of him for how hard he had been working lately, and that he was an intelligent man who is very good at his job and would pull through. He took a deep breath and said \n\n\u201cSweetDovely, I\u2019m so happy with you. You really make me feel like a man and feel so loved in a way like I\u2019ve never felt before.\u201d\n\nI was so over the moon! We talked some more and ended the call with him saying he\u2019d be taking me on a nice dinner date this weekend and to the theater (which we both love). I just wanted to share this success moment, there\u2019s been many others, but this one was so special I had to share with the community that made it all possible! :)","title":"What RPW has done for my relationship","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/rara0n\/what_rpw_has_done_for_my_relationship\/"}

When I couldn't convince him that he needed to discard things, I tried to \"practice gratitude\" my way out of it. I had been in a mentality of trying to \"just be grateful\" and come to terms with the condition of the house. It didn't work because the house was truly unacceptable and living there was causing me deep emotional pain. I tried to tell him how the furniture made me feel but he didn't hear me; I'd been fighting him on the furniture for so long that he got used to tuning me out.\n\nHere's what I did: Instead of saying \"We should swap out the tables\" and \"This place is a mess\" and \"I'm stressed out because I can't work from home when the house looks like this,\" I just said \"Reading *The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up* a few years ago was a real turning point in my life. It sounds corny, but the book is a lot more substantive than the pithy synopses you always see online. I think it would be fun if you read it, too, and then we could go through that process again in our shared space.\" I said it once.\n\nThen, I shut up.  I gave up. 100%, completely, entirely gave up on changing anything about the house. I had a feeling that giving up would \"work,\" but I stopped expecting anything, allowed myself to hope that this would make me feel better, and otherwise moved on with my life. I didn't mention it again. Don't get me wrong: I really, really wanted to mention it again, but I didn't. I cleared out a space for myself on the kitchen floor, and that's what I used when I worked from home. That felt a lot better. I didn't love spending 9 hours a day on the kitchen floor, but it got the job done.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I noticed that he had picked my copy of Marie Kondo's book off the shelf and stashed it in his bag. I didn't know he had actually been reading it until he sat down at the dinner table one night and told me why he thought it was stupid. I told him that was okay, I thanked him, told him that I thought it was really sweet of him to try, but he should stop reading if he doesn't find it useful. He kept reading the book.\n\nOver the long holiday weekend, he quietly pulled all his clothes out of the closet and the dresser and moved about 75% of them into bags to donate. Then he pulled all of his books off the shelves... He Marie Kondo'd the whole damn house. We borrowed a friend's truck and donated several truckloads of stuff. He measured all of the shelves and drawers and brought home baskets to keep everything tidy and tucked away. \n\nHe brings home fresh flowers to keep in a vase that covers the biggest stain on the formica table now.

Chosen unwisely for a husband and 2. Made matters worse by being a terrible wife. I learned and incorporated a lot from RPW but ended up getting a divorce, which was his idea but I think was for the best. But I decided to do things differently in any future relationships because of my understanding of the red pill. After almost a year of nun mode following the divorce, I started dating again and am now happily married to an amazing, high quality man. Here are just a few of the things that this subreddit has helped me to do better.\n\n\n1 I got crystal clear on what my own life values are. I think this came with time, maturity and life experiences to really know and understand who I was and be ok with myself\u2014it really all came together for me in my mid twenties (after I was already in my first marriage) and I would NOT recommend doing things in that order lol. Along with getting clear on what values I did want, I also chose to leave behind a lot of the cultural\/familial values I had been entertaining that I didn\u2019t truly want: things like the pressure to have kids, the religion I was raised in, and some of my mom\u2019s ideas about sex, health, etc.\n\n\n2 I looked for someone with very similar values to my own. I didn\u2019t realize how important this was until it was too late, the first time around. I specifically chose to date people who had similar hobbies to help narrow my search, since I think what you do in your free time is generally indicative of your underlying values. Plus I value lots of quality time and shared hobbies with my partner. I found someone who not only shares my favorite hobbies, but is also kind, speaks my love language, extremely mature, puts in effort and makes our relationship a priority, sooooo attractive, physically fit and healthy, hardworking, in a successful job, very intelligent and thoughtful, financially well-off and careful, loves to try new things, social, shares my religious views, patient, takes strong traditional masculine leadership and initiative in every aspect of our relationship, forgiving, appreciates and encourages my femininity, fun and funny, is emotionally articulate and able to have hard conversations, comes from a healthy loving family, and is working on goals for the future that I am so excited to be a part of. It was easy to vet when I knew what the lack of many of those things looked like, plus the RPW guidelines helped me keep my eyes wide open.\n\n\n3 I loosened up a lot. I caused so many unnecessary slights in my first marriage by being uptight about the small things. For example I used to always choose the cheap brand at the store, even though I knew my ex preferred the name brand. It was annoying, disrespectful and definitely not worth it to save a few cents.\n\n\n4 I stopped being codependent and got control of my thoughts and emotions. I used to let a small thought, or my partner\u2019s mood, or an assumption I made trigger me into a downward spiral. Now I choose which thoughts and emotions to entertain and which to discard. I choose not to take things personally, and clarify or ask if I feel like I\u2019m getting a message from him I\u2019m not sure about instead of making an assumption or blaming myself for his feelings.\n\n\n5 I started things off on the right foot with sex. I used to HATE sex, I know there was tons of emotional and religious issues in my first marriage that was keeping me from being able to enjoy and give freely with sex. I decided from the get go with my now husband to initiate sex every single day, do things like flirt and wear sexy lingerie and perfume that I never really bothered to do, and choose to intentionally enjoy and be crazy for my husband. I have discovered that I actually LOVE sex and I was totally missing out in my first marriage.\n\n\nI\u2019ve learned so much from the mistakes I\u2019ve made and from this page. I\u2019m definitely not perfect and I still have a lot to improve on, and I know we will experience lots more challenges over the years, but I am just so grateful to be in a solid marriage to a wonderful person.","title":"Field Report","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/iyid7i\/field_report\/"}

When I was younger, I wanted to grow up to be just like her and in a lot of ways today, I still do. She radiates such a pure and feminine energy. She is a great high standard at which a high value woman should carry herself in terms of kindness, generosity, dealing with anger and frustration, navigating female friendships, etc. At 21, I still rewatch all the old favorites (Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper, Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses, Barbie and the Diamond Castle, etc.) and listen to the soundtracks on repeat. It reminds me of a simpler time. It reminds me that I need to slow down and reconnect with myself and my feminine nature and desires. When I was younger, I focused a lot on the happily ever after of Barbie ending up with her man. One thing I\u2019ve noticed while rewatching these movies was that Barbie never focused too much on her prince or her happily ever after as much as I thought she did. In fact, if you were to observe closely, none of the plot lines ever centered around finding a man\/husband. They were just the icing on the cake. The side story. She saw more importance in living her life, improving herself, helping those around her, and supporting and uplifting her female friends. In doing so, the men in her life naturally gravitated towards her. There were so many things Barbie has taught me. I learned that I still get too caught up in searching for a man sometimes that I forget to enjoy and build upon the relationships I do have with the friends and family around me. I sometimes forget to walk and speak in the grace and elegance of a feminine woman. I don\u2019t spend as much time having a childlike wonder of the world, living in curiosity, learning, and taking the time and effort to do things to the best of my abilities and with love for what I do. That concludes my tribute to Barbie, but I would love to hear how she has made an impact, if any, on your lives as well! :)\n\nEdit: I am talking about the Barbie persona\/character from the movies made to promote the dolls.

First of all, I would like to thank you all for this wonderful sub! It's such a relief to know I'm not an outlier for rejecting the feminist agenda as a woman.\n\nNow to the question. I'm using throwaway for anonymity. My boyfriend (35M) and I (23F) have been dating for two months now. I love him very much and consider him a great person: kind, intelligent, funny, well-read and creative. I'm also very attracted to him physically to the point where I barely can keep my hands off him lol. We have similar hobbies and I love spending time with him. Needless to say, I'm committed to this relationship and I can actually picture myself marrying him. \n\nThat being said, there is some issue with sexual compatibility. I'm pretty kinky and submissive (both sexually and outside the bedroom), he seems rather vanilla. I would like him to be more rough during sex: more degrading dirty talk, spanking (maybe even face slapping), consensual non-consent, hair pulling, some bondage, you know the drill. Is there any way I can encourage him to become more dominant like that? This is something I deeply crave but I don't want to ask the 'relationships' sub as they would just tell me to say it to him directly. I don't think asking him directly to be more dominant would be a good idea as it seems too emasculating and it sort of goes against the dynamics I'm trying to establish (him being the leader). If I tell him I want him to be more dominant I'm still telling him what to do which actually makes me the dominant one. He also has issues with low self esteem and an avoidant personality disorder so I don't want to make him feel inadequate. He doesn't deserve it. \n\nI have shown him my  [https:\/\/bdsmtest.org](https:\/\/bdsmtest.org\/select-mode) test results so he knows I'm sexually submissive and a masochist, yet it doesn't seem to affect his behaviour in the bedroom. \n\nI was thinking about encouraging him to do this test together:  [https:\/\/mojoupgrade.com\/](https:\/\/mojoupgrade.com\/) but it still feels emasculating, like some passive-aggressive \"topping from the bottom\" strategy.

His palate has expanded INSANELY and he's starting to get excited about Wednesday more than grilled chicken\/rice\/broccoli Mondays.

So another win-win.\n\n- I also mentioned in an update thread (I think it was valentines day) that his own dad (his mom & dad are redpilled af and incredible role models) asked him \"WHY THE HELL HAVEN'T YOU MARRIED HER YET?\" and he decided to corner me on St.Pat's (they're Irish) to tell me all about the cute little baby socks he saw at the store and when I wanted to have kids.

I was bluepill, a raging feminist when he met me. I learned I actually, truly, wanted nothing more than to be a wife and mother. I found out he loves that too, and wants to support me. I found new ways to communicate, to take care of myself, to *let go*. Being redpilled was the best thing that happened to me (s\/o Jordan Peterson, a prof from my university) for initializing these changes and an even BIGGER s\/o to myself for turning myself into the best version of myself.\n\nI'd also like to mention I'm depression free, something I struggled with for over 7 years. (Also I'm sure a huge factor into this possible engagement). \n\nI feel like myself, not even an average version of myself, but the best version. Now?

Then we realized how vividly we knew how the ideal man would make us feel, but had absolutely no idea how men want to feel in presence of their ideal woman. I write \"feel\" because all of the desired traits in a partner basically result in a positive feeling (warmth, comfort, passion etc.) \n\nSo women want to feel protected, small, coddled, adored in the presence of a man. The man is basically an ideal version of a father.\nSo what feeling does an ideal woman inspire in a man?\n\n\n\nThe same feeling you get when you are petting your purring cat. Or dog. Or whatever animal that adores you and can express that affection in a way, that you can pick up and identify.\n\nThis is the perfect analogy for me and here's why:\n\nAfter a long day, I come home and I honestly don't want to talk for the first 10 minutes. \nI lie down on my sofa, and a cat jumps on my lap and lies down. It purrs. It's warm. It's so cute. It's affectionate. It asks no questions. No \"Can you do this for me?\", \"What do you want for dinner?\", not even \"How was your day?\" I tell you, I don't even want to hear or answer considerate and caring questions right then. ALL I want in those first 10 minutes is to zone out. \n\nNow the cat analogy applies for other moments as well. During depressing and hopeless times, I personally don't feel the need to TALK about it, and I don't think men do either. I even want to avoid talking about it, because there is nothing to say, and it hurts thinking about it. What I want is to FEEL affection and support from my loved ones. And that is expressed through touch, through vibes. The cat would just hug me, and not say a word. It would purr. And I'd be in a healing trance. \n\nSo when you try to emulate the ideal woman, and try to engineer an atmosphere that is most pleasing to your man, be the cat.\n\n","title":"Analogy for what men look for in women","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5ylvgs\/analogy_for_what_men_look_for_in_women\/"}

When dating and marriage were strictly governed by traditional gender roles, families, and society as a whole, it made plenty of sense to preserve your virginity by any means necessary. Back then, a woman\u2019s virginity was one of the main facets of her value on the marriage market, and such idioms were necessary to scare young women out of their teenaged horniness so that they could be worthy spouses for prospective families\u2019 sons.\n\nWhether we like it or not, that is no longer the world we live in, at least not in the West. Today, parental and familial figures are not heavily invested in who their children marry. People marry or partner up for love and choose their own partners, at their own pace, rather than rushing to get married so they can finally have sex and make babies, thanks to the invention of the birth control pill, feminism, and sexual liberation. \n\nThe vast majority of Western society has pre-marital sex, so if you withhold sex from an attractive and coveted man, there will likely be plenty of other women ready to give it up without hesitation. It\u2019s a [Tragedy of the Commons](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tragedy_of_the_commons): most people won\u2019t pay for your expensive milk no matter how good it is for the buyer and for society as a whole if it\u2019s pretty easy to get free milk elsewhere. On top of that, traditional gender roles on the societal scale have shifted and become much more fluid. Men and women\u2019s relationship goals have become more and more adversarial. Women are less and less defined by their roles as wives and mothers and more defined and valued by their achievements and careers. **With all these changes in mind, can this simple cow and milk idiom even be applied in good faith anymore?**\n\nI don\u2019t think so.\n\n**For modern healthy relationships, creating self-imposed, artificial, and arbitrary restrictions on how much you submit, give your love emotionally or sexually (unless both you and your SO are bound by religion or strong TradCon values), or perform \u201cwife duties\u201d is holding your love hostage.** Such is not the most effective strategy for securing commitment goals in the 2020s.\n\nThis is NOT to say that you have to make a high-risk bet and give your all *every* single time you begin dating a new man. *You do not have to sleep with a man until you feel like you you\u2019ve properly vetted him and can trust him.* You do not have to force yourself to cohabit with a man during the 6th month or to do his laundry and dishes in order to win him over during the 7th, just so things go \u201caccording to schedule\u201d.

Such tactics may leave a bitter aftertaste in the mouths of those smart or experienced enough to recognize it, and intuitive men are usually the ones we want anyways.\n\n*Instead of using this outdated idiom, think about your relationship as an internship.* Just like in an internship, an actual full-time job offer (marriage, proposal, long-term commitment) is rarely promised from the get-go, but will most likely be offered if you perform outstandingly. \n\nIf you really want the full-time job, in this case to be his wife, it makes no sense to show up to your internship with the intention to half-ass your performance or to only do the bare minimum in order to save your actual skills for when you get the full-time gig. This will not trick your employer into thinking, \u201cWell maybe if I offer her the full-time job, that will motivate her into doing better work.\u201d \n\nBy not doing the work necessary to be an outstanding partner, you are simply making your partner anxious to find another intern, or at the very least too indifferent to think about getting on one knee with an employment contract. If you embrace your femininity and give your love enthusiastically, you\u2019re eons more likely to inspire the passion and excitement in your partner to offer you serious commitment like marriage.\n\n\u2014\n\nOn the flip side, you should be analyzing if this employer is the right fit for you during your internship. Before you even apply to the internship, you have to make sure it\u2019s legit. Women who graduated from RPW University with qualifications like being in the best shape and grooming of their lives, having amazing homemaking skills and top-notch girl game, and excelling at being a feminine, [soft place to land](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/dfixcs\/youre_so_sweet_it_makes_my_life_so_much_easier\/) are too qualified to apply for unpaid internships or for questionable companies headquartered in somebody\u2019s mother\u2019s basement. They also know better than to apply for jobs that won\u2019t align with their long-term career goals that they aren\u2019t willing to compromise. \n\nYou maintain a critical eye even after landing your dream internship. Just like in an internship, you should be judging if your relationship has a healthy environment to thrive in. Does your employer treat you with respect and care? Do you and your employer get along well and manage conflict appropriately and productively? Are employees paid well for their time and work? Are there job security and benefits in the long term? Are there any red flags that the company has unethical practices? An internship is a great time for YOU to vet your employer as well.\n\n\u2014\n\nNo matter how excellent you do at your internship, a full-time job offer is never guaranteed. The employer may decide he doesn\u2019t have the budget to take on a new employee, or the company may go under and that\u2019s that. The employer might realize that even though you do good work for him, there\u2019s something else missing - he may need a PR person but you specialized in finance. That doesn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t offer you the job because you gave him too much during your internship - **it means there was some other factor that affected the outcome.**\n\nIs it worth the extra effort and vulnerability if these risks exist? At the end of the day, your chances at getting the full-time job, especially from a coveted employer, are still much higher if you gave it your all than if you created artificial boundaries on what you can and can\u2019t give simply because he doesn\u2019t have \u201cwife privileges\u201d yet. Withholding these privileges will do nothing to inspire him to give you \u201chusband privileges\u201d in return. Love is still a game and a gamble, and when you choose to play, you accept that there\u2019s always a risk of losing. The goal isn\u2019t to find a completely risk-free option (hint: it doesn\u2019t exist); the goal is to find the most successful strategy and take your chances there. It is fine to play the game with the goal not to lose, but if you can afford to, it is even better to play to win.\n\n**TLDR: Forget the outdated idioms and think in terms of what gives YOU agency. Concerning yourself with the price of your milk leaves you outcome-dependent on the fickle and extremely varying, unpredictable nature of the cow market\u2019s individual agents. Instead, view your relationship as taking ownership of your actions during an internship AND forming your own opinions of your employer. This ensures that everything that happens in your life and in your relationship is a direct result of YOUR own actions and choices.**\n\nAlso, a huge thank you to u\/girlwithasidecar and u\/Protocol_Apollo for helping me with this post!

Even at this age, as a young feminist and future career woman, she didn't want children. Everyone told her she'd change her mind. At 16, she didn't want children. At 20, she didn't want children. At 22, she fell in love with a man 10 years her senior, Dave, and told him clearly that she didn't want children. At some point, however, Dave decided that he *did* want children and that Jenny would eventually change her mind. Jenny entered academia, where she grew into an even more\u00a0liberal feminist and unsurprisingly, *did not want children,* a life choice that was very much supported by her environment. Ultimately, she told Dave that under no circumstances was she ever willing to have children. He walked and she let him. She never changed her mind and, last I heard, had met a man with similar goals and was pursuing her PhD.\n\nI met Sally when I was working at a movie theater in college. She was pretty, slender, smart, and was dating another employee, Cody. Cody was good looking, confident, funny, social, ambitious, and often a complete asshole. They both came from good families and had been dating for nearly a year, at 19. I don't recall if they intentionally followed each other to college or met there, but just from the oversharing young people do, I knew that Cody had been Sally's second partner and she had been his first. Love was in the air and they both assumed that, after college, they would eventually get married.\n\nAlthough Sally wanted a career, even then, she *knew* she wanted to be a doting wife and mother.\u00a0At 19, Cody seemed game for the former, but less interested in the latter. Finally, he told Sally that he didn't want kids... and she immediately ended it with him. She told him she loved him, but that she was not willing to spend her youth on a man who wouldn't *eventually* want children. She *had* to know that if they married, children would be in their future. She didn't throw a fit or demand promises. She walked... and he didn't let her. A few months passed and Cody thought it over, consulted friends and family, and decided that he would *eventually* want children. He genuinely loved Sally... and she did not immediately take him back. Unsurprisingly, she felt that he'd only given in to an ultimatum she didn't intend to give. I don't know what Cody did or said to make her feel differently, but in time, they did get back together. Last I heard, they're happily married and on baby number two.\n\nA tale of two *women,* the men's decisions are irrelevant. These women, however different, both vetted carefully, at a young age, for a man with common goals. Upon discovering that their choices weren't consistent with where they wanted to go in life, they set aside their feelings and walked. Ultimatums are *always* a terrible idea and neither of these women gave one. They calmly and rationally stated their deal breakers and took a future they didn't want off the table, accepting the consequences. One found herself single and the other found her man had a change of heart. The difference here is that Jenny had *endless* years to find a man who didn't want children, especially in her environment, while Sally had only a handful, making it all the more important for Sally to vet with her endgame in mind.\n\nFor all the women here who find themselves considering giving an ultimatum or even waiting him out, I'd advise you to rethink. Consider what you want from life and vet accordingly. If he tells you he sees a different future than you do, walk... not so he'll run after you, but to free yourself up for someone with a similar vision. There are many, many wonderful men out there and the earlier you begin vetting well, the better chance you'll have of landing one.","title":"When It's Not an Ultimatum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/brcrks\/when_its_not_an_ultimatum\/"}

Thank you all for your support and encouragement to keep writing. So as promised, I will expand on the topic of what I think it means to be truly \"beautiful.\" While this post will mainly focus on guiding young RPW to develop into beautiful and admirable women, I hope that all of you will find value in this advice and use it at any age to further cultivate your femininity. \n\nBeauty, as I mentioned [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/92zu21\/a_letter_to_young_women\/), is a trait that indicates longevity in a woman's desirability, and elevates a woman above a potential sexual conquest to a potential LTR, wife, and life partner. A major contributor to this trait is a woman's ability to be a caregiver.  Here's what I've learned.\n\nI remember when I was first getting to know the man I'm with. I remember telling him about my experiences working as a nursing assistant in a long term care hospital, and later in a group home for developmentally disabled people. These stories are hard for me to tell and open up about, because many of the people in my life, including very close friends and my previous significant other, communicated disgust and aversion to the mere idea of my job, let alone the specifics. I'm currently working toward my second degree, in nursing, and have devoted my professional life to the care of people who can't take care of themselves. And while I understand it is not a glamorous profession, my experiences have fundamentally changed my character, and made me into the woman I am today. I believe it will help me be an exceptional wife and mother someday (really good at changing diapers?). \n\nI remember sitting on his couch, and strangely, he really wanted to hear about all the things I've seen. Most people my age have little idea what true suffering looks like, and no desire to find out. But I shared some of it with him, the most life-changing patients, the hardest shifts, and my worst fears and proudest moments. And I remember his eyes full of emotion, speechless, and he *saw* me, clearer than anyone ever had, and *loved* me. \n\nI promise I'm not saying go get a job in a nursing home, necessarily. But I deeply believe there is immense value in pursuing opportunities to learn to take care of someone other than yourself, if you have the chance. That, to me, is one of the core essences of womanhood and femininity. Esther Perel was on TEDx, and explained that while we are all born knowing how to be loved, we must somehow learn *how to* *love*. To learn sacrifice. And many women don't learn this, I would argue, until they are a mother, or far later in life, or possibly never. But I believe that it is a trait you can cultivate and develop now, and will help you stand out as a true woman in a sea of selfish, egocentric, superficial, vain, demanding, ungracious girls, and many other traits clearly associated in developmental psychology literature with the behavior of young children, which is sadly encouraged by feminism and \"sorority\" culture on campuses. \n\nComedic side story: I have also gotten very good at making beds, and once, when we hadn't even really started dating, but had been best friends for months (he was definitely into me), I jokingly showed him how to make a perfect hospital bed, mitered corners and all, after helping him do laundry. He pulled on my shirt and made a joke: \"Oh what material is this? Wife material?\" \n\nMy point is that caregiving is an incredibly attractive trait in a woman, particularly to men who someday want marriage and a family. How can a man see your potential to be a phenomenal mother and home maker someday if all you've ever pursued is self-interest? Which is certainly not a bad thing - it's absolutely the norm. But RPW often are not satisfied with being the rule, but rather by being the exception. Be the exception. Here are a few ideas if you have an extra hour or two throughout your week:\n\n1. Volunteer or work at a hospital or long term care facility, even if you don't want to get hands-on, the people in these facilities are lonely and desperate for someone to talk to\n2. Volunteer with disabled people or children, reading to them, playing music for them, providing companionship. Many mentally disabled people don't often get out into the community, and need people to take them on hikes, grab an ice cream, or would love to meet and play with your dog.\n3. Work at a daycare, after school program, babysit, or tutor children who are falling behind in school \n4. Volunteer at an animal shelter, or foster a dog or cat that needs a temporary home if you're not ready or sure if you want your own\n5. Volunteer at a retirement community - older generations of women also have fantastic advice and wisdom :)\n6. Volunteer at a homeless shelter or a domestic violence shelter, even if it's just to cook or clean. \n\nOr any other idea you can think of to devote some of your time each week to learning how to love, how to care for someone in need, to be someone for those who have no one. My work has taught me patience, compassion, communication, and has given me purpose, gratitude, and fulfillment. That is femininity, that is beauty, and might help you on the path to becoming the type of woman a man notices, and realizes his life would be much better with her in it than without.

But, using the word \u201cequal\u201d makes no sense when talking about a red pill relationship. It\u2019s not as though I can say \u201cHe makes more money than I do, but I wash the dishes, so everything is equal!\u201d That\u2019s not how it works, we can\u2019t measure those things on the same scale. I have no idea how many washed dishes it takes to be equal to his extra hours at the office. \n\nWhen claiming to be equal, we are focusing on the wrong things, whether our contributions to the relationship matches his. But, that\u2019s not what\u2019s important, what is important is that we are doing our best to make him happy. In a relationship, it is your responsibility to make sure to do everything in your power to make the other person happy, and if you picked a good captain, he will do the same for you. \n\nIn a way the type of equality we do have is that our obligation to make him happy is equally as important as his obligation to make us happy.

Of course, since men and women are different, the things that involves are going to be different.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t wash the dishes because he makes more money than I do.

I wash the dishes because it is one of the things I can do to fill his happiness bar, then he comes by and smacks me on the butt, because that\u2019s one of the things that fills my happiness bar. It\u2019s based on the principle that if you do things to make him happy, he\u2019ll want to do things to make you happy, which in turn makes you want to do things to make him happy, and so on. It is a positive reinforcement cycle that encourages both parties to fill the other\u2019s happiness bars. \n\nThat is what is important about you duties, not whether they are equally hard, equally time consuming, or even equally important, it\u2019s whether you are going above and beyond to make him happy, even if at first it means doing more than him. No, that\u2019s not equal, but so what? Someone has to be giving, and someone has to go first, if you want to have a positive relationship with your partner. \n","title":"Your Relationship is Not Equal","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/38pk3a\/your_relationship_is_not_equal\/"}

The core of rpw is how we interact with the man in our lives.\n***\n \n\nWomen tend to be consensus builders (more on the female social matrix in another class \u2013 take my word on this for now). Because of this, any group of women will tend towards homogeny. The Red Pill has neve been about a particular way of life, however, RPW slips into this mindset quite often.  It\u2019s not rare to see someone discussing the \u201cRPW Lifestyle\u201d or \u201cthings an RPW would or would not do\u201d.\n\n \n\nThis is *problematic* (u\/guywithgirlwithabike does not like the word problematic but it tickles me pink \u2013 expect to see it pop up again).\n\n \n\nThe problem is that an \u201cRPW Lifestyle\u201d gives on the vague sense that there is checklist somewhere. If one were to find where on the darn sub we stashed the check list, she could follow it step by step, the heavens would part and she would be blessed with the most perfect blend of alpha-beta man that has ever walked the earth.  Now, I\u2019ve seen a pared down version of the TradCon checklist (thanks Mom!). That checklist says: graduate from school, find a job, get married, have sex, buy a house, have a kid. The details of *how* are a bit fuzzy and I\u2019ve never been one for checklist, still, it seems like a solid plan right?\n\n \n\nWell if I personally followed this plan, I\u2019d have married my high school sweetheart. This is something that HSSH and I long ago agreed would have ended in divorce within five years of the marriage. I\u2019ve never been good with checklists, they make me itchy.\n\n \n\nInstead we call RP a *toolbox*. The challenge about toolboxes is that they contain tools. You have to know how to [use tools properly]( https:\/\/www.picclickimg.com\/d\/l400\/pict\/273521503919_\/Vtg-The-Far-Side-Gary-LarsonMechanically-Declined-Graphic.jpg) or they don\u2019t work. Further, you need to know which tool is the right tool for any given situation.\n\n \n\nIf you are partnered up, it\u2019s very easy to find the right tool. [Ask your man](https:\/\/redd.it\/42ruyb). Should you have long hair or short hair? What does your man like? Should your closet contain dresses or jeans? What is your man attracted to? Stay at home or go to work? What works best for your relationship?\n\n \n\nCue the feminist outrage: \u201cYour own preferences matter!!\u201d they will shout. This is why the *[no feminism*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/about\/rules\/) rule exists, it\u2019s exhausting to put caveats on everything but caveat I will. *Of course* you should be comfortable with the decisions but if you have a strong preference *why are you asking the internet what you should do?*\n\n \n\nOh, and if you ask your man\u2019s opinion and he says to use a hammer, don\u2019t insist that the screw driver is better. It will make him crazy and it\u2019s, dare I say it, disrespectful. Ask me how I know.\n\n \n\nNow for you single ladies the question are a bit different. You should be asking: \u201cwhat do *men* prefer\u201d then \u201cwhat do *the men I am attracted to* prefer\u201d and \u201chow limited will I be if I do this thing?\u201d.\n\n \n\nAn example: *I want to get a tattoo* - Now a lot of men might be turned off by tattoos so you might want to think twice. However, if your \u201ctype\u201d is Mr. Rockabilly then you are probably not going to have an issue with that full sleeve you want to get.  It isn\u2019t a problem to limit your options if your girl game is strong. Repeat after me: I don\u2019t need to attract *all men*, just *the right man*.\n\n \n\nThere are some [\u201ctools\u201d or strategies]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/wiki\/index\/tableofcontents\/axioms) that will be consistent across all RPW. This is stated in the sidebar:\n\n \n\n> We come from all different walks of life, so on RPW you will find harmonious and productive discussions between very religious traditional conservative women and hardcore BDSM submissives and everyone in between. **What we all share is not a lifestyle, a set of values, or a worldview, but a way of relating to men.**\n\n \n\nThe biggies are: understanding our own nature, understanding male preferences (and the  more nuanced \u2013 understanding *your* man\u2019s preferences), submission, respect, sex. All these deserve their own rambling lecture so we\u2019ll save them for another day while the baby naps.\n\n \n\nBefore we go, let\u2019s talk about areas of disagreement. This is where the \u201cRP is not TradCon\u201d distinction really comes to light. There are a few topics that are guaranteed to rile up the base. Among these (non-exhaustive): monogamy or polyamory\/open relationships, married v lifetime relationship, virginity and partner count. If RP was a checklist then these would all be an either\/or choice. Because it\u2019s not, it is entirely possible to be a polyamorous woman, in a lifetime relationship who has a n-count in the double digits and still practice RPW techniques and strategies.\n\n \n\nSo I challenge you to start thinking about RPW in terms of interactions with men and about how *effective* something is as a strategy. We can still talk about where to get a cute 50s style dress if you like (I have an adorable one for our Christmas Tea Party), but that dress doesn\u2019t make you an RPW, it just makes you a girl in a dress.","title":"TradCon is RPW but RPW is not TradCon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/mdr62i\/tradcon_is_rpw_but_rpw_is_not_tradcon\/"}

Her account is gone but she's written many of the posts in our Wiki so she will never be forgotten. \n\nWhen we are all trapped together and nerves are frayed, sometimes the best thing to do is practiced this time honored RPW technique. \n\n\n***\nLet\u2019s start with a little joke ripped right from \/r\/jokes top of all-time list\u2026\n\nA woman goes to the Doctor, worried about her husband 's temper.\n\nThe Doctor asks: \"What's the problem?\n\nThe woman says: \"Doctor, I don't know what to do. Every day my husband seems to lose his temper for no \nreason. It scares me.\"\n\nThe Doctor says: \"I have a cure for that. When it seems that your husband is getting angry, just take a glass of \nwater and start swishing it in your mouth. Just swish and swish but don't swallow it until he either leaves the room or calms down.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later the woman comes back to the doctor looking fresh and reborn.\n\nThe woman says: \"Doctor that was a brilliant idea! Every time my husband started losing it, I swished with water. I swished and swished, and he calmed right down! How does a glass of water do that?\"\n\nThe Doctor says: \"The water itself does nothing. It's keeping your mouth shut that does the trick\".\n\n**The STFU Method**\n\nThe STFU Method ^TM is a handy way to create and keep peace in your daily life. More specifically it will enable you to have a more loving relationship with your SO. We would like to examine why, how and when it is applied while also dispelling the misconception that you are a doormat for doing so.\n\n*Why do I need to STFU?*\n\nThe art of listening is an invaluable skill that can be useful in all areas of your life. We listen to friends when they have trouble, kids when they want to show something off, our parents when they have some wisdom to share, and a variety of other times in our lives. How it is applied to your current romantic relationship is detrimental in the success\/failure of it. I\u2019m sure we can all agree that if you don\u2019t listen, you can never fully understand. This is exactly why we stress  on RPW to just STFU. \n\nWhile communicating your wants, needs, and feelings is important, listening is often *more* important in the health and welfare of your relationship. Understanding what is actually going on vs what you feel makes it easier to know what the next step is. Reflexively responding to situations is only good in fight or flight situations. In the beginning of learning how to listen, it is good to just take all the data presented and digest it before actually forming an opinion about it. Over time, you will find that you instinctively can discern the appropriate behaviors for specific situations without ever needing to voice anything. In the beginning however, it is important to just S T F U. Listen. Learn. Absorb. \n\nFor new relationships, it is easy to STFU. You want to know how the person acts, what they think, what they like, and you want to please them. This is great and wonderful. The trick is when you have been in a relationship and the honeymoon phase is over, how do you keep that ability to listen and desire to please going? You see this guy at his worst and you are expected to still take him seriously? *GASPS* Seriously though, complacency is the killer of romance. So how do you prevent this? By listening to your partner. When you listen to your partner you are actively working on your relationship. You cannot expect a relationship to survive with minimal effort on your part. It just won\u2019t happen. \n\n*How do I STFU*\n\nThis might seem like a no-brainer. Just close your mouth and all will be well. It can be a little bit trickier than that. STFU also means body language. Eye rolling is not you STFU\u2019ing. Gasping with exasperations is you not STFU\u2019ing. Pouting is you not STFU\u2019ing. \n\nSTFU is you actively and consciously removing yourself from a situation to better assess it. For those who are more practiced, it could very well be only keeping your mouth closed. However, for most of us self proclaimed strong willed bull headed women we may have to *smile* and *say \u201cok my love\u201d* and **walk away**. These three small actions can make a big difference in your communication style. \n\nThe first step I suggest is to smile. This is probably the hardest step because you want to rip someones head off when they say something you don\u2019t like but the more you do this the easier it\u2019ll become. Fake it til you make it! The first few times, your SO might look at you like *WTF is wrong with her?* but over time it\u2019ll just be a positive way to signal that you need some time to process the interaction you just had. You could give mean stank face but what is that going to accomplish? Who does that really hurt? You because you\u2019re the one going to be stuck with the wrinkles. LOL. So smile and breathe in.\n\nNext is to state something agreeable. \u201cYes, my love\u201d or \u201cok, honey\u201d both give a positive affirmation and also reminds your SO that you love them with a term of endearment. You acquiesce to the situation and you do so graciously. This is to preserve intimacy and the closeness of the relationship. When has being a bitch ever gotten you anywhere? Never!\n\nMost important step here. Walk away. Go do what was told to you or just go to the other room. You can let your hamster tire out away from your SO. **DO NOT GO BACK UNTIL YOUR HAMSTER IS PANTING IN THE CORNER ALMOST DEAD FROM RACING AROUND.** Take this time to process what just happened. What was said, how was it said, what did you feel, why did you feel that way, what was your SO trying to say. All of these things are your hamster at work. You can use this as an exercise in reigning it in and over time you should be doing this faster and faster. This is also the time when you realize if you ACTUALLY do have something to say to your SO. This is when you can actually tell whether you should bring up something because it was detrimental on his part to the relationship. However, if that is the case, you still want to do it with a calm, cool and relaxed demeanor so taking time away is always a good idea. \n\nThose are just my three steps. Most times, I just need to close my eyes and take a deep breath and can handle most situations. However, these three steps have always been fundamental in my growth. When a breathe isn\u2019t enough, I walk away. If you find that you are walking away alllll the time, then there may be deeper issues with yourself at hand and those should be examined too. \n\n*When do I STFU*\n\nWhile reading this, you may think that STFU only applies when your SO says something to you that hurts your feelings. However, this applies to a variety of feelings. Not just hurt ones. When you aren\u2019t getting your way, when you think you know better, when you want to control things, when you want to dominate things, when you want something done in a certain way, when you want something done now, when you don\u2019t want to do something now, when you want to hamster, when you don\u2019t want to have sex, when you feel bossed around, when things just aren\u2019t getting done and you want them done NOW!!!! Etc etc etc. \n\nBossing, nagging, whining, bitching, complaining, griping, mothering, smothering, gumbling, belly-aching are alllllll times when you need to STFU. At times these things can be masked as coming from a good place. A gentle reminder every 10 minutes to take out the trash. A little push in the right direction because he has no clue what he is doing. A honey-do list a mile long. Sound familiar? \n\nNow go and STFU!","title":"Quarantine Reposts: The STFU Method","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/flatu8\/quarantine_reposts_the_stfu_method\/"}

Well, I know there can be a lot of misinformation and fluff surrounding the subject, so I've decided to make a short guide explaining why we gain weight and how you can keep your weight in check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the US, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. If you have a BMI of over 25, you are overweight, and if you have a BMI of over 30, you are obese. You can check your BMI here: [https:\/\/www.nhlbi.nih.gov\/health\/educational\/lose\\_wt\/BMI\/bmicalc.htm](https:\/\/www.nhlbi.nih.gov\/health\/educational\/lose_wt\/BMI\/bmicalc.htm)\n\nIf you want to increase your SMV or take care of your looks and you\u2019re overweight, one of the most straightforward steps is to not be overweight or obese. When one partner say the other has \u201clet themselves go\u201d, 90% of the time, they\u2019re talking about their weight.\n\nThe good news is that being overweight is 100% your fault, which means it\u2019s 100% within your power to fix it.\n\n**How do I manage my weight**?\n\nEvery person has what\u2019s called a TDEE, or total daily energy expenditure, which primarily depends on their age, current weight, activity level, and sex. You can calculate yours here: [https:\/\/tdeecalculator.net\/](https:\/\/tdeecalculator.net\/) .\n\nYour TDEE is how many calories you need to eat per day to maintain your weight. A calorie is a unit of energy. If you consistently eat more than your TDEE, you will gain weight. If you consistently eat less than your TDEE, you will lose weight. It doesn\u2019t matter if those calories come from organic vegetables or ice cream sundaes. For every 3500 calories you eat below your TDEE, you will lose approximately one pound. For every 3,500 calories you eat above your TDEE, you will gain approximately one pound.\n\nFor instance: take a 5\u20194\u201d woman who is 30 years old, weighs 180 lbs,  and is sedentary (say, has a desk job and does not exercise). Her TDEE is 1,826 calories. So, if she eats 1,300 calories a day, she will lose approximately one pound per week. If she eats an average of about 1800 calories a day, her weight will stay the same.\n\nGenerally, women should not eat less than 1,200 calories a day. You probably need more if you\u2019re tall or exercise regularly, and you *definitely* need more if you\u2019re pregnant or breastfeeding (if you are, then you probably should ask your doctor before making any lifestyle changes).\n\n**What about exercise?**\n\nExercise is great for your mental and physical health, and you should by all means try to make it a part of your life. But unless you pay attention to your diet, exercise alone most likely won\u2019t make you lose weight. In fact, exercise is an appetite stimulant, so you\u2019ll likely eat all of the calories you consume during exercise.\n\n**But...I could never give up \\[insert food here\\]**!\n\nYou don\u2019t have to. Weight management does not require the consumption of any specific food or product. Similarly, no specific food will make you gain weight. You don\u2019t have to go vegan, eat keto, or Whole30 unless you want to. You just have to limit how many calories of food you consume. The reason people trying to lose weight eat certain foods is because they are much more filling than others. Most people can easily eat 700 calories of cake in one sitting (one big slice), but I have yet to see anyone eat 700 calories of broccoli (2 kilograms). Sugary, salty foods generally cue people to overeat, but you can still eat them while losing weight. Similarly, you can gain weight eating nothing but sweet potatoes, spinach, and avocado if you eat enough of it.\n\n**But..calorie counting doesn\u2019t work for ME because....**\n\n*NO.* You are not a special snowflake. Your metabolism isn\u2019t broken. You\u2019re just counting your calories incorrectly or overestimating how much you exercise. Empirically, it\u2019s been shown that the heavier you are, the more likely it is that you underestimate the amount of calories you consume or overestimate the amount of exercise you do. The machines at the gym that estimate calories burned often overestimate.\n\nThe metabolic variation in between individuals is very small, usually less than 100 calories. So it\u2019s likely that the TDEE calorie calculator linked above will be quite accurate for you. And if it\u2019s not....first of all, make sure you\u2019re properly counting your calories and assessing your activity level. If you are, it\u2019s possible you truly have a rare metabolic issue and should see a doctor, especially if you have other symptoms like lethargy, mood swings, and hair loss.\n\nIf you want to really know how much you\u2019re eating, buy a food scale and download MyFitnessPal. You\u2019ll see that the \u201ctablespoon\u201d of peanut butter you\u2019ve been eyeballing is really three (90 calories vs. 270 calories). Remember that drinks, cooking oil, sauces, and taste tests all have calories. Even if you don\u2019t track all your calories all the time, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what an appropriate portion size is.\n\nIf you see someone who\u2019s much thinner than you who seems to eat more than you do, remember that you don\u2019t know their whole life. They might eat 4 slices of pizza but then not eat for the rest of the day. They might exercise a lot. Don\u2019t use them to justify your own behavior.\n\n**I don\u2019t want to count my calories! Too much work!**\n\nCalorie counting is the only surefire way to lose weight. Any other diet that makes you lose weight works because you\u2019re also restricting your calories, whether you realize it or not.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to count calories, you can make sure to eat foods that are filling and nutritious for the amount of calories they provide, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains. I am vegetarian but that has nothing to do with weight management. You can be fat or thin on any diet, but it\u2019s much easier to overeat some foods than others. Many modern foods---cake, chips, pies, soda, fries--are engineered to hack our taste buds and make us consume more than we truly need, which is why healthy eaters and people of normal weight don\u2019t usually consume them in excess.\n\n**But this doesn\u2019t work! I just gain it back!**\n\nPeople gain back weight because they go back to their former habits. Of *course* you\u2019ll get back to how you used to be if you go back to the habits that made you fat in the first place.\n\n**Most importantly, be honest with yourself.**\n\nIf you want to prioritize your comfort and overeating over your appearance, fine. But don\u2019t pretend that you\u2019re cursed with a terrible metabolism. If you\u2019re overweight, it\u2019s because you are consistently eating too much. Period.","title":"Swallowing the (T)red pill: The Raw Truth of Weight Management","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/aldf17\/swallowing_the_tred_pill_the_raw_truth_of_weight\/"}

Although many of us may admire her, I doubt anyone envies how long it took Prince William to propose. For those of you waiting on a proposal, it can be challenging not to get caught in a tangle of anxiety and worry. I\u2019ve come to realize lately that I got caught up in the pressure my family was putting on me to get married. I\u2019m in my early twenties, still very young, yet as many of my family and friends my age around me are getting the ring, I started feeling that pressure and put expectations on myself on how my life should be. If you\u2019re anything like me: young, anxious, and wanting reassurance, this post may help you.\n\nHowever, please note: This is not a foolproof list and a guy can do all of these right and things still fall apart. This is a list for how to know your man *intends* to marry you, not how to know he *will.* But they\u2019re things that I have noticed that have given me reassurance about **why I shouldn\u2019t be worried over my relationship\u2019s natural progression:**\n\n**-\u201dWhat\u2019s mine is yours.\u201d** Does he share his stuff with you? Or does he have [that stupid old pickup truck he never lets you drive?](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yCMqcFAigRg) Does he keep score of how much money you\u2019ve put towards the relationship vs him? My man certainly spends more on me than I do him, but he prefers it that way and I show my affection towards him in other ways money can\u2019t buy.\n\n**-Does he treat you how he would treat himself?** My boyfriend appreciates things of high quality. If he\u2019s eating steak, I\u2019m eating steak. If we\u2019re going on a trip, he makes sure we both have what we need. He doesn\u2019t ever leave me to fend for myself. This can even be simply that he asks you what you want from the store when he\u2019s out getting things for himself or if he makes a meal, he makes enough for the two of you. *He\u2019s doing things with the both of you on his mind, not just himself.*\n\n**-Are you his treasure?** I'm not quite sure how to describe this one so this is just one example and it may look different for you, but one of the ways my man shows this to me is by gifting me gold jewelry. He is very passionate about gold and likes to collect gold coins for his own pleasure and for financial safety and security. He shares his treasures with me by adorning me in gold. To him, it is more than just a simple piece of jewelry. Unlike diamonds or other precious stones, gold cannot be replicated or made in a lab. And unlike many other metals, gold is everlasting and does not wither away with the years. It\u2019s timeless. He adorns me in one of the most precious metals this earth has to offer and his gifts to me say a lot about how he sees me.\n\n**-He\u2019s *romantic*.** Copied and pasted from a previous comment of mine: This is an unexpected one because everyone has a different definition of romantic, but all it boils down to is making extra efforts to show love and affection towards your partner. I had a previous boyfriend outright tell me that he\u2019s not a romantic guy, which, in my head, translated to: he\u2019s a lazy and passive partner who won\u2019t go out of his way for me past the honeymoon stage, if that.\n\n**-He takes you out in public.** Have you met his friends and family? Does he invite you to important events for him? Has he invited you to accompany him to work events? One of the ways the press gauged how serious Prince William and Kate\u2019s relationship was was when Kate started appearing at Prince William\u2019s formal functions. Up until then, he's never made intentional public appearances with any of his ex-girlfriends.\n\n**-Does he have good boundaries with other women?** My man and I don\u2019t keep close friends of the opposite sex as a way to protect our relationship, but if you and your man do, are you his priority over his close female friend(s)? Does he go running to them when something goes wrong in your relationship? Is he at the beck and call of his mother? Does he turn down other interested women or does he entertain their company?\n\n**-Are you able to speak freely with him about the future without any existing tension with him?** Does he include you in his future plans? My man and I can speak freely about our future wedding, marriage, kids, how we would decorate our future home, where we\u2019d live, what kind of dog we\u2019d have, etc. together with no pressure or resistance from either side.\n\n\n**BONUS: He\u2019s respectful to you even while you disagree with each other.** If you\u2019re arguing and he pulls out his entire arsenal to hurt you, he doesn\u2019t respect and value you or the relationship as much as you thought he did. I know how to hurt my boyfriend. I know I can do a lot of damage if I wanted to. But no matter how angry or hurt I am, I *never* pull things out of the vault of things that can\u2019t be unsaid. There are some words that once they\u2019re out there, you can never take back and that can seriously damage your relationship.\n\nIn most cases, it\u2019s unwise to rush your relationship\u2019s natural progression for a ring. It takes *time* to get to know someone and for them to get to know you. For the lovely Kate Middleton, that long of a wait and trial period was necessary in order to vet for the future Queen of England. And while she waited a decade, her wait was well worth it. She got her prince in the end.","title":"\"Waity Katie\", or How to Know Your Man Intends to Marry You","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/tgny22\/waity_katie_or_how_to_know_your_man_intends_to\/"}

They each made a lot of money, and were generally pretty nice people (aside from the last one). She also dated a lot of very nice, high value men. This is how she landed these guys, and then lost them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Marry a man because you love him, not because he can fund your life. She never married a man that she really loved, it was about what they could give her. Money, status, etc. Don't marry a man you don't love completely and wholly just because he checks all of your boxes. It's shallow, selfish, and cruel to the man who thought you were in it for the right reasons. Of course a man should provide, but he does not exist purely to buy you stuff. They should be your partner in crime, your lover, your confidant, and your best friend.\n2. Men *really* value a playful, open spirit... to an extent. My mom was not the type to turn heads when she walked down the street, but she had her pick of the pack because everyone wanted a piece of her personality. She was the type who could talk to anyone, was down to do anything, willing to try everything, loved a good prank, and knew how to make people laugh. This was her main draw and she knew it. Even when her looks started to fade, this quality kept her young. The downside to this was that she couldn't turn it off. She was incessantly bored and impossible to entertain 24\/7. There has to be a line drawn, and you have to be able to settle down, or else your life is going to be pure chaos.\n3. Men also *really* value the ability to speak concisely, intelligently, and with class. They need you to be able to have a decent conversation not only with them, but with their colleagues, family, friends, maybe even their boss at a company party, If you can't carry an interesting, engaging, intelligent conversation with just about anyone, that's gonna be an issue. He picked you, and so who you are and how you act says something about him and his judgement.\n4. Admit your faults and gracefully accept criticism. The inability to do this is a really common trait these days, and it kills relationships. If you go into a marriage (or any relationship at all) thinking that it's you against him, that you're right and he's wrong, that he's dumb and you're smart..... That will kill your relationship in it's tracks. It sets up a sense of superiority. You end up looking down on him, and he will feel that lack of respect to his core.\n5. Don't allow life to take away your softness. My mother and I both had hard lives as children, and that translated to being very brittle, emotionally unavailable people in adulthood. It's easy to fall into this hole, and I sat with her in it until I got married and realized that it was only pushing my husband away from me. Softness translates into being malleable. You should be able to adapt to anything and form yourself into who or what you need to be in this or that situation, while maintaining that light core.\n6. Take care of yourself, physically. My mother, bless her soul, aged horrifically. She smokes, she drank a lot in her youth, she did a lot of casual drugs, never wore sunscreen, ate like crap, etc. I can see how much of a toll it's taken on her self-esteem. While she wasn't a head-turner, she was beautiful, and she threw that gift down the toilet. While you may not be hot when you're 60, you can still be beautiful if you take care of yourself.\n7. Believe people when they tell you he's not a nice person. If one person says it, that's an opinion. If seven people say it, you should probably listen. Highly manipulative people put on a face for people they like, and drag everyone else through the pasture. He will eventually stop liking you, and the chickens will come home to roost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd love to hear about what things you ladies have noticed in your mothers' marriages, what went wrong and what went right.","title":"7 Things I've Learned From My Highly Desirable, Thrice Divorced Mother","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/13zz8jz\/7_things_ive_learned_from_my_highly_desirable\/"}

My man and I are not \"perfect\" for each other in many ways, but we have experiences from being together a long time that I'll never be able to replicate with someone else.\n\nLove becomes mediocre at times. The honeymoon period ends, and you're left with the day-to-day drone of real life, with passion merely existing in the background. This is normal and healthy. There will be periods where you think you don't feel anything for him, because humans naturally become conditioned to sensory input over time, as well as emotional input, when it becomes a constant.\n\nLong-term love becomes something you don't appreciate until it's gone. Monogamy can get boring, everyday, mediocre, but appreciate that you have that luxury. Appreciate that love is so abundant in your life that it becomes like breathing. Don't take your boredom for granted, the reason couples stay together so long is that they don't up and leave whenever things get mildly inconvenient.\n\nDon't relentlessly search for something better, because chances are you'll never have what you do now. There is value in something you've built with someone over such a long period of time you begin to take it for granted. Instead, focus on ways you can get that spark back. Continue building that love by having new experiences together. Travel, go rock climbing, experiment in the kitchen, try a new sex position.

While I have learned so much from so many women, including both of my grandmothers, I unfortunately don\u2019t have a mother whose shoes I wish to fill.\n\nMy parents are both engineers, having worked for the same national laboratory for the entire breadth of their careers. My father once mentioned to me that he sees so many bright young women with big eyes and bigger dreams entering their careers, only to become bitter, competitive, and resentful twenty years down the line (if not sooner). Unfortunately, my mother was one of those women. \n\nI have distinct memories of her warmth and grace from when I was a young girl, her soft touch, and bright smile. That woman now exists only in my memories and in pictures from years ago. As time went on, something inside of her changed. She became cold. Unresponsive to my sister and I. Rude and demanding to my father. Her smile faded, and a persistent scowl took its place. It got to the point where my father fell out of love with her, and left her for another woman. While I hated my father at the time for leaving, I can\u2019t help but understand and feel compassion for him, and a part of me is thankful for it because otherwise, I would have had a complete misunderstanding about what marriage, love, and wives should be.\n\nMy mother, like many women out there, is now in her late fifties, in her third marriage, this time to a dreadful man with a nasty temper and little consideration for anyone but himself. She even told me a few months before the wedding that at her age, you sort of have to take whatever you can get if you don\u2019t want to be alone. \n\nI often admit to my own man that my biggest fear in life is becoming her. \n\nWhile I\u2019m pursuing my own career, in nursing (a profession my mother considers \u201cpink collar\u201d) I hope to continually prioritize my future husband, children, and role at home. Will that be enough? \n\nIt worries me to see what has happened to her, especially since she used to be so full of light. I recently found a picture of my parents together before my sister and I were born. She\u2019s looking up at him, with so much admiration and love. I sent it to my dad, and he told me later that he had cried for the first time in a very long time, remembering who she used to be. \n\nThank you, RPW, for providing such a positive feminine community. I hope to continue actively pursuing these strengths within myself, and every day I wear my grandmother\u2019s necklace around my neck to remind myself of the many other amazing women I\u2019ve come from. I\u2019m not my mother, and I hope to learn from her mistakes instead of following her path. ","title":"What happened to women?

Girl game is far more important, and there are a plethora of other fashion styles and choices that are also suitable for RPW. However, if you\u2019re open to suggestions and looking for a way to upgrade your style AND you\u2019re doing good with your girl game, this is a fun, light-hearted read!\n\n*****\n\nAs many of you can tell, I like [sundresses](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/d2\/e6\/cc\/d2e6ccad43b2df1472b1e950543cc121.jpg). They\u2019re a quintessential part of my wardrobe. I wear them the entire summer, unless some pesky mosquito riddles my legs with bites and I have no choice but to put some pants on while they heal. In the colder months, I wear them in darker colors\/moodier patterns and pair them with tights, sweaters, or cardigans. They\u2019re pretty much here to stay year-round.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always my style, though. Back in the day, I actually preferred [hypebeast street style](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/2d\/b3\/7f\/2db37f0529e34e03b51f8d99854a4312.jpg) and [grunge-inspired](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/19\/62\/a3\/1962a3d305bccf2b57fe9ac76b688be8--grunge-girl-soft-grunge.jpg) outfits. I made a conscious effort not to look dainty or girly or classy or overtly feminine - I was not like other girls (barf \ud83e\udd2e) after all. Instead, I aimed to look edgy, \u201ccool\u201d, and sexy. And you know what, I\u2019ll be honest: I still got some male attention dressing like this, and I\u2019m sure many other women who dressed like I did got that too. What I did *not* get, though, was attention or attraction from the kind of guys I wanted - the masculine, benevolently protective men that I would happily follow.\n\nThen I found RPW. I started making changes to my attitude, my dating strategies, and my overall outlook on life. I also realized that men and women are attracted to different things: I may like my men to look cool and edgy, but the men I wanted did not want that from me. Instead of being angry that the men I liked were turned off by my [cakey grunge makeup](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/bb\/4a\/9d\/bb4a9dfa236f087e37db580b26e04c1b.jpg) or didn\u2019t treat me like a lady when I [dressed like a \u201csexy\u201d tomboy](https:\/\/m.lovethispic.com\/uploaded_images\/blogs\/40-Teen-Girl-Fashion-Ideas-With-Swag-4026-38.jpg) like I used to, I began to accept that I should [dress for the man I wanted](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6tk4e9\/dressing_for_mr_right\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) if I wanted to use style as a part of my sexual strategy.\n\nBut I also realized that I was *single*, and I didn\u2019t have one exact type or preference for the man I wanted. I liked the pragmatic and assertive business man as much as I liked the idealistic academic. I was as intrigued by the frontman of the popular local band as I was by the gentleman sitting next to me at church. I liked guys my age, men significantly older, and everyone in between. I was young and still soul-searching, so even though my type of man is much more evident to me now, I had no idea when I was 20. How do you effectively use your style as the powerful tool in your RPW arsenal that it is when you don\u2019t know exactly who you\u2019re trying to target? How do you cast a wide net and appeal to almost ALL the men who could potentially be yours?\n\n*****\n\nSo I did a little research. I did what any other person raised in the internet age would do, and went to r\/askmen. I found [this thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/2d1p3l\/men_what_is_your_favourite_outfit_on_a_woman\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) asking men for their favorite outfits on women, and the top comment, with 3x more upvotes than the post itself, told me that sundresses made men weak in the knees. Since then, there have been [even](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/g8nut2\/for_women_a_guy_in_a_nice_dress_shirt_or_suit_can\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) more [threads](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/one6cm\/what_do_you_like_about_women_in_sundresses\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) covering the same topic, and time and again the men are still saying sundresses.\n\nHere are some quotes from men on their love for sundresses, and more importantly, WHY they love them so much:\n\n- \u201cSundresses are the pinnacle of women's fashion in my personal opinion. **Classic, simple, eminently feminine.** Also, women in sundresses always **just seem happy** for some reason. That in and of itself is highly attractive.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI think it's because they are **casual** and yet can be **incredibly elegant.** It's the perfect combination of the two. It's like I get to see my wife all dressed up for a gala charity event, but with the twist that we're just going to get a beer on the patio.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIt's more the **perceived femininity** than the exhibitionism that makes a number of men think about it for a while. Less Victoria Secret (not that we dislike that), more ... **it hits the heart more than the libido.**\u201d\n\n- \u201cFor me is truly something about cuteness separate from just straight up sexiness.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI wonder if the idea of the flowy dress is hot because **so few women wear anything that lends to the mystique of what\u2019s beneath** nowadays. I mean, with the outfits women wear commonly, you practically already know what they look like naked.\u201d\n\n- \u201cGonna be honest, the reason I like them is because they are viewed as kinda **classy and nice and innocent** but they are also **sexy**, and revealing, and for some reason I always feel like I may get a sneak peak on a windy day or something (even though it never happens, lol). Love it when my wife wears them!\u201d\n\n- \u201cThey are just generally flattering and casual and I dig it.\u201d\n\n- \u201c**It\u2019s the difference between beauty and hotness**. The **beauty** of a woman in a sundress **tugs at the soul of a man**. The hotness of Victoria Secret tugs a bit further south. The feeling of the sundress is like appreciating **fine art**, you can just stare at it and get lost for hours and the feeling of the lingerie model is about as short lived as the perceived action that the guy wants. Not to be so redundant but it\u2019s true, the sundress expresses the perception of **fun, playful, comfortable, and being all around approachable**. Couple that with a set of flats and it\u2019s a winner for sure.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIt\u2019s because they are light and flowy, a few thing happen - 1) they **hint at the figure** underneath, without being too \u201cin your face\u201d about it like a tight dress does 2) when the sun hits it, you get a silhouette without actually being able to see anything 3) when the wind catches it, it will press against that section of the body and it shows off the figure underneath, again without showing anything, and usually in a blink it\u2019s gone as the wind drops. Basically it\u2019s an **outfit designed for the \u201ctease\u201d**, the \u201chint\u201d at what lays beneath, whilst still being able to maintain **massive levels of modesty**.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI straight up go non-verbal when faced with a pretty girl in a sundress.\u201d\n\n- \u201cSundress makes a woman appear to be very **low maintenance** and **down to earth**.\u201d\n\n- \u201cThe first time I saw my wife in one I honestly thought she looked like a beautiful angel from Heaven. Had butterflies just looking at her.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI've never seen a woman in a sundress look anything but **happy**. But more importantly, they look **present**. Like **in the moment, they're just enjoying being themselves**. If you're just rocking a look and feeling yourself, that's **attractive as hell** on its own.\u201d\n\n- \u201cThe thing about club dresses, is that I associate them with a negative stigma. While all girls in club dresses aren't superficial, high maintenance, and entitled, it seems entitled, high maintenance, and superficial girls often dress in that manner. And I admit that it creates contradictory feelings when I see these girls. They're sexy, but they remind me of the stereotypical superficial girl. On the other side, when I see a girl in a sundress, she looks **much more approachable and less superficial, and therefore sexier**, even though the dress doesn't emphasize her assets as much as a club dress. Personally, I find them both sexy. But I'm much likely to hit on a girl with a sundress than a girl with a club dress.\u201d\n\n- \u201dIt is hard to put to words, but there's something about the **suggested airspace between cloth and skin**. It is partly why many women are very cute in oversized sweaters or big dungarees too.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nSo making the sundress into a wardrobe staple was the final change I consciously made in my transition from being blue-pilled to red-pilled. The sundress wasn\u2019t the only thing that changed my romantic life for the better, by a long shot. It was so much more important for me to fix my attitude and outlook. Still, they hold a special place in my heart because they became the symbol of what femininity and RPW meant to me, and what I gained from this little community of ours. (Plus, my man goes gaga over them, so that helps :P) \n\nIf it feels like too far a shift from your current style, or you feel attached to the aesthetic you have now, there are plenty of ways to incorporate sundresses with your own personal style. Perhaps grunge-SunshineSundress would have started off by wearing it in [darker colors\/serious prints with combat boots or ripped tights](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/b9\/db\/c8\/b9dbc85974f080af616783ef856e2415.jpg). Hypebeast-me would find inspiration in [what the Kardashians have been rocking](https:\/\/image-cdn.hypb.st\/https%3A%2F%2Fbae.hypebeast.com%2Ffiles%2F2021%2F07%2F2021-summer-dress-trends-4.jpg?w=1600&cbr=1&q=90&fit=max) and pair it with some statement hoop earrings. When I age out of the mini-dresses I wear today, I can find inspiration from the sundresses that [Kate Middleton](https:\/\/www.usmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Duchess-Kate-Middleton-All-Time-Best-Summer-Dresses-Slide-3.jpg?w=900&quality=86&strip=all), [Meghan Markle](https:\/\/www.hellomagazine.com\/imagenes\/fashion\/hfm\/20210603114591\/meghan-markle-fashion-staples-summer\/0-554-1\/meghan-summer-style-t.webp?filter=high) or [Melania Trump](https:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/1s\/2019\/08\/25\/04\/17659016-7391729-Melania_looks_illuminating_in_this_650_sold_out_Calvin_Klein_dre-a-2_1566704778345.jpg) wore in public office. While the compliments from women about me being fashionable or trendy have declined, men have noticed me MUCH more, in a more romantic, wholesome way.\n\nWill this work for everyone? No. There were a few comments in the threads from men who said they felt indifferent to them. If your SO tells you he prefers you in jeans and a t-shirt, turtleneck sweaters, preppy office-wear, or even the grungey\/street style outfits from my blunder years, throw this post in the trash. His opinion is the only one (outside your own) that you should really bother to take into consideration when it comes to being attractive to him. If your current style brings you more joy than all the male attraction in the world, then this post isn\u2019t for you either, and that\u2019s completely okay. But if you want to appeal to A LOT of men\u2019s protective instincts and tug at their heartstrings from the first impression because you\u2019re still single and looking, the sundress is a fantastic place to start.","title":"A Love Letter to the Sundress","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/qu7ual\/a_love_letter_to_the_sundress\/"}

Given that I am freshly engaged to a man I swiped right on four years ago, I'd say no! The men we are looking for, the serious and commited ones with classical masculine values are out everywhere, looking for a good woman to invest their time into. They might try OLD out of curiosity, or perhaps some of them are too busy to go out and meet people IRL and hope somebody good will get caught in their online net. You never know, so here it goes:\n\n1. **How you should present yourself**\n\na) Your pictures. Have one very good looking picture of yourself looking your best; you might think men love a laid-back woman of low maintenance, but valuable men also like ladies who can steal the spotlight at an event. DO NOT USE FACE TUNE - they can tell. Have one candid picture of yourself with minimal\/no-make-up ... let there be no surprises as to how you look into your day to day life. Have one picture of yourself head-to-toe or at least down to your knees. Men do not like overweight women (deal with it!) and you achieve nothing by tricking a man with high angles and close shots. Your purpose is to build a lasting relationship, not to score a one hour date.\n\nb) Your description. This one should be about your passions or hobbies; jokes or memes that men can latch onto to start a good conversation. By God, do not write that you love pizza and cats! Do NOT write that you are RP\/ a trad wife\/etc; Do NOT write that you are looking for a man that is traditional\/RP\/X, Y and X. Instead of going \"bazinga! I am the man for her!!\", men read it as an expectation; besides, lots of men have no time or little interest in Reddit or RP theory.\n\n**2. How a valuable man presents himself**\n\nIf you pay close attention you will see that us women are too pretentious about the things that don't matter and not pretentious enough about the things that do. We latch onto false flags and we make lists about how our future imaginary husbands should be. But how do valuable men, the ones who are good for us, look like online?\n\na) Their pictures will be meh. *Men are not like us*, they do not know their good angles and they don't ask their friends to take pics of them on their night out. Also, what makes a man attractives consists of his posture, his attitude and his voice, things which do not manifest in a photograph. If he looks \"meh\" in pictures, then there is a good chance he could be amazing IRL, so give him a chance!  If he has shirtless pictures or an instagram with 150 pictures of himself, then he is a self-absorbed individual with too much time on his hands who needs to be avoided like the plague.\n\nb) Their descriptions. **Men who are traditional often do not see themselves as traditional, but \"normal\"**. As long as his bio is not empty and consists of a description, a joke or some movie refference, you can safely assume he is fairly traditional (unless you see some other red flag like too many clubbing pics ). Avoid men who list their height or income. Avoid men who tag themselves as RP or say they want a RP\/trad wife\/etc. It's women who make the imaginary boyfriend lists, not men. Those who do have something wrong with them and are waiting for women to fall at their feet.\n\n**3. Once you match**\n\na) The man NEEDS to message first AND have some sort of pick-up line or ice breaker. If he cannot be bothered to think about something funny\/interesting to get your attention for the first five minutes, then *he will not be bothered further along in the dating process*. It does NOT matter if the pick-up line is cheesy, it does NOT matter if his grammar is incorrect. Any man who raked his brains to try and make a good impression is worth at least chatting with for a little while.\n\nb) Everything needs to move to real life quickly. Men who know what they want and who know what they like want to get to see you quickly; only teenagers and f-boys like messaging 10 girls for weeks at a time. Not only do you expect him to be the first to take the conversation to other types of messanging and to ask you out, **but you need to not keep them waiting for weeks**. Men who have their stuff together will drop it if they feel like they need to orbit you before getting the \"privilege of taking you out for a coffee or a walk in the park.\n\n**4. General advice**\n\na) Beware of false flags! **You are looking for a man who is attractive (to you), reponsable, serious, caring and protective**. Anything else is temporary and subject to change, especially if you are young. Do NOT vet out men because they don't have a college degree, because they are of a different religion, because of their politics, their taste in music. You will end up alone and regret letting good men go.\n\ne) **Do NOT ask men if they fit your list.** Do not ask a man in your first interactions if he wants kids\/wife\/a house, how much he earns or anything like that. Men want their dates to be fun, spontaneous and passionate and every subject should come natural to the conversation. Men know and feel when we take out our mental check list and start ticking their \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers.

For me, this felt like a very long time when I couldn't find much RP advice on how to deal.\n\n# My background (feel free to skip)\n\nI went to a women's college and was a hardcore feminist in the past. I spent my 20s focusing on my career and moving around and being an introvert lone wolf. I found RPW in my late 20s and first came here to mock it, then came here to learn. \n\nI had to admit to myself that yes, I did want a husband, I did want to have babies, and I even would love to stay at home with the babies. I spent time in nun mode and did a lot of RPW reading (Fascinating Womanhood - both books, Laura Doyle's Surrendered Single, this sub, etc).\n\nMy man and I met each other through OkCupid last January, when we were both 31. We connected right away. Even though we met so late, we feel like we are high school sweethearts because both of us were inexperienced before this. So, I doubt my story is typical, but it can happen.\n\nAt my age, this felt like my last chance. I have some advantages that helped me still have a high SMV at 31:\n\n* A baby face. I look young and still get carded. I recommend getting a good skincare routine down. I'm obsessed with Korean skincare for that youthful glow.\n* Low N-count. \n* Good body (Normal BMI range).\n* Naturally feminine and childlike. \n\nSkipping ahead, he proposed a week ago and I'm still feeling that just-engaged glow. We moved in together in October and I was emotionally ready to get engaged then. So that was 8 months of waiting for him to pop the question! \n\n# Here are my tips for navigating the period when you are very committed but waiting for the ring.\n\n**Let him decide on his own terms that he wants to marry you.**\n\nYou want your man to feel like he is deciding to pick you. It works best if he is leading the relationship and you are submitting.\n\n**Let him bring up engagement if possible.**\n\nIf your man is high value and he loves you, he should not shy away from commitment. My man first said something like \"I could see spending my life with you\" and later, we talked more concretely.\n\n**If you move in together, make sure you are on the road to get engaged.**\n\nI know moving in before marriage may not be very RP, but in these times, men may expect to do so. My man was ready to move in before I was. When we had our conversation, I made sure that we were planning to get engaged before I agreed to move in.\n\n**Never be a nag.** \n\nIf you man wants to be nagged, he can call his mother. Never fall into a nagging, motherly role. You are the fun and cheerful girlfriend.\n\n**Especially don't nag about a ring.** Discuss engagement and marriage as little as possible. Trust that he remembers the few, special conversations you have about it. Give him the space and time to make these decisions.\n\n**A few months (yes, months!) after you've established that you want to get married 'someday', have a talk where you establish your expectations on a timeline.**\n\nAround the winter holidays, we had a discussion about when we wanted to get engaged. I told him I wanted to in the next six months. \n\nBoth of you agree on the timeline. Make sure he knows you will be disappointed if he doesn't meet this. Be high value and know what you deserve, which is to be engaged and not waiting years for a ring!\n\n**Trust your man.**\n\nImagine he was the captain and you were the first mate of a real boat. He told you that you were headed to Engagement Island within a time frame. Would you constantly harass him wanting to know if you were still headed there and if you would make it in time? No, you would trust that you were on course. \n\n**He should come to you to discuss your ring preferences too!** And that's when you can reveal your secret Pinterest board detailing exactly what you want (lol).\n\n**This time takes a lot of patience.**\n\nDo not lose hope. Be patient. Manage your own anxieties and mental health. Journal out your feelings. It is feminine to be flexible and go with the flow. \n\n**As Laura Doyle puts it, be the Goddess of Fun and Light.**\n\nThe more feminine and playful you are, the more he is drawn to you. Be a tease. Be fun. You want him to daydream about you at work and smile to himself.\n\nKeep expressing gratitude and joy. This way he is fully confident he can make you happy, and making you happy makes him happy.\n\n**Stay the course.**\n\nEven if you are moved in together, don't get complacent. Keep up your beauty routines. Cook for him. Keep your sex life active. Find time for cuddles. He is getting a preview of marriage with you, so make sure he likes this preview.\n\n**Let go of certain expectations.**\n\nDo not get set on it happening in a certain way, on a certain special date. If there is anything that Covid-19 has taught me, it's that you can't predict what disasters may strike.\n\nAround January my man told me he would take me to Hawaii for a dream vacation in March. I knew he would propose then and we were both excited. He even hired a photographer for the big moment. Obviously, the trip was canceled.\n\n**If you need to do so, reiterate how important engagement is to you.**\n\nMen view engagement completely differently than we do. The truth is, you may have to bring up engagement if you sense he is not leading. Approach it as a problem that he has to find a way to solve.\n\nAfter our trip was canceled, I didn't see any sign that he would still propose, and I was really down. Well, one day I let him know how I was feeling. I cried and was very vulnerable. I told him he could ask me when he handed me my morning coffee as I didn't need any fancy trip. I told him engagement meant a lot to me and the state of 'not being engaged' was stressing me out. \n\nAfter that talk, he proposed within a month.\n\nThis period can be really tough, but most RP advice still applies. If you've properly vetted, your man should step up and get you two there. \n\nGood luck. <3","title":"Getting to the ring in less than a year and a half","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/gzqgml\/getting_to_the_ring_in_less_than_a_year_and_a_half\/"}

I was looking for ways to improve my new marriage by getting back to traditional values and was trying to research ways when a link popped up concerning red pill. Eventually I found my way here and became obsessed. My old ways were mostly easy to give up - or so I thought. I adopted the red pill woman mentality relatively easily. When I read The Surrendered Wife and tried to implement Laura's ideas, I hit some road blocks. \n\nI would literally have to trust my husband with everything; our livelihood, multiple decisions about family and money, stuff I knew based on our two year relationship, he couldn't do. He forgets literally everything I tell him, even if it's multiple times. One weekend I had to work and the kids wore the same underwear two days in a row! I fell apart, came here to try and get my questions answered on how to fix my husband and make him an alpha - and had my ass torn apart and handed back to me. I almost gave up the whole red pill idea right then. But one poster in particular (I'll always remember her!) said something that clicked and it as something to the effect of I was only fooling myself into thinking I had surrendered but by the way I told my story it was obvious to red pill women I had not. \n\nSo I tried again. Things honestly couldn't get worse for my husband and I unless he was to lose his job. We rent a place from his parents, drive cars that are over 10 years old and are financially quite poor and over burdened. So I thought, \"what the hell? Things truly can't get much worse\" and I just let my husband have it all. Do you know what? I have never been more happy to be so completely wrong about something in my whole life!!!!!!\n\nWhat a burden has been lifted off my shoulders to not handle the finances anymore! He's stepped up, created a budget, he gives me a budget I can stick to and as long as I'm under it I know we have money. He goes after sales bonuses like a lion after prey because he now sees the money in our account directly - I haven't looked at our bank account in months! Just recently my husband needed to replace his car and we had money saved because he had begun a car fund. He was talking up a real storm about a car I was worried would cost too much  in upkeep and insurance and isn't practical for our family - do you know he gave up on that car himself?! He asked me my opinion on the car and I was DYING to give it to him but instead I did as Mrs. Doyle instructed and replied \"whatever you think.\" He instead changed his mind and bought a 4 door sedan and actually came in under budget! And our insurance dropped $25 a month! The change has been incredible! \n\nThe best part is that my husband noticed my changes and thanked me the other day. \"I've never felt more in charge of my own life or family and I've never felt more like a man in any relationship.\" That's what he said to me. I'll always be red pill and always be a surrendered wife. It truly does work.","title":"Surrendered Wife - 4 months in and unbelievable improvements","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/3jnove\/surrendered_wife_4_months_in_and_unbelievable\/"}

I'm not going to lie; I came here to judge what I thought would be silly, man-obsessed, insecure women. Boy was I wrong.  \n  \nI must have spent a whole afternoon devouring the top posts, tutting as I went along because I was purposely seeking out 'extreme' views to validate my preconceptions. I kept coming back because I was fascinated! A few weeks in, I started to really think about what you were posting and how a lot of it made sense. I realised that so many women on here are brilliant and interesting and that are diverging from what we're told we should be doing as 21st century women and that it was making your lives all the better for it.  \n  \nWhile I believe I will never subscribe to the RPW philosophy 100%, I wanted to let you know that this sub has made massive changes in my life over the past 3 months. Before, I thought that even though I was about 30lbs overweight, a man should be interested in who I was. Now I've realised, why should he? I've lost 12lbs lately and started dressing more feminine which makes such a difference in the way people seem to view me. I've started acting more feminine and listening to men more, rather than getting super drunk all the time and trying to act like I'm \"just one of the guys\" which is what I thought guys wanted. I've started trying to make myself the sort of person a good quality man would want to be with, not just for the sake of an LTR, but for myself. I can't even describe it here (especially since I'm on my mobile) but the whole way I view the world is different.  \n  \nWhen I find the right person for my next LTR, I have so many plans for how I'll do it differently than before. I'll do more sweet things for him, I'll keep working at trying to be attractive to him, I'll be sexually available to him, I'll let him feel like he's a man! It's all thanks to you wonderful women. I feel so guilty for judging you all so harshly before.  \n  \nLike I said, there are many elements of TRP that are not for me, but what I've learnt from this sub is invaluable. I think a lot of women could benefit from RPW like I have and I want to thank you all for sharing your insights.","title":"Came here to judge.

She said that her husband was impressed with how fast my husband was. \n\nI took this as an opportunity to brag about my husband a bit. I admitted, that after so many years, and three kids, and an all around busy life, I had forgotten how athletic he is. It makes me blush to see him now that he has rededicated himself to his athletic hobbies and be reminded what a beast he is! I love it! I can't believe I have ever been so distracted that I didn't take notice of how incredible he is. \n\nWe all smiled and laughed and move on with our conversation.\n\nA few weeks later, my very best friend, who was also present, and is also pretty red pill herself (although I doubt she knows that term) brought the conversation back up. She and I know each other independently of the group we were with, and I had only just introduced her to many of these women. \n\nShe said that when I bragged about my husband it completely caught her off guard because she's so used to being around groups of women who are complaining about or just being generally condescending about the men in their lives. It's almost unacceptable to brag about how awesome your husband is, because husband bashing serves as a type of sick female bonding. That afternoon made her rethink how she talks about her own husband and how she's going to respond when the women around her start the eye rolling and griping about their own husbands. \n\nI just wanted to share this experience with everyone. It reinforced my own good behavior, which felt pretty good, but I was also glad to to be a positive influence in how someone I love thinks about their own relationship. I also wanted to remind everyone that when you approach your relationship from a place of gratitude and appreciation it shows up not just with your SO, but with everyone you interact with!\n\nEdited to add: Also, who you choose to spend your time with is a big influence on your own attitudes!

I used to be hyper independent and thought that I did not want a relationship. Once I found this community, I became totally dedicated and read everything I could find. \n\nMy favorite was going back to the old posts on theory and reading everything on the wiki page. I also read some of recommended books - Fascinating Womanhood, For All Women, Marry Him.   \n\nNow, I\u2019m about to be engaged with the man of my dreams who treats me like a queen, and I have an incredible loving and happy relationship.   \n\nI just wanted to come here and share some of the things that I believe changed my life the most and got me here. This is nothing that hasn\u2019t been said hundreds of times on this sub, but I just wanted to make a post about my experience!  \n\n1. Be pleasant. In my observations, men envy other men whose girlfriends\/wives are happy and pleasant and sweet. This doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t have boundaries and should be a pushover and ignore your feelings. It means that you should never direct your anger or stress about life towards your man. If you are upset, say that you are upset and hurt, but do not get short with him or rude. Sometimes when I have a negative thought that I want to express to him, I change it around in my mind to become a pleasant one. For example, if I have a negative thought such as, \u201cI hate my job,\u201d I could instead express to him: \u201cI\u2019m so grateful I get to come home to you after a stressful day at work.\u201d This keeps the tone of our relationship positive instead of bringing negativity. If you do have a moment of weakness (it\u2019s ok, we\u2019re only human) and let out your negative emotions on your man and are short with him, make sure that you catch yourself quickly and apologize and say something nice to him. A huge part of being pleasant is making sure you\u2019re happy and comfortable with yourself, so make sure to do things that make you happy, whatever that is (yoga, hobbies, spend time with friends, etc.). \n\n2. Allow him to lead you. This one is big. Empower your man to be the leader that you want. When he does take action to lead you, express how grateful you are and how happy it makes you when he takes charge and takes care of things. Tell him that you love how much he takes care of you and makes your life easier. Never criticize him. It makes him feel like crap and he will stop trying to do things for you\/lead you. Don\u2019t try to control him and mother him. If you think that he\u2019s doing something wrong or if you think that you know  better way of doing things, then just let him make his own mistakes. If you give up this control, he will likely show you that he is way more capable than you ever expected! I think that a big part for me about allowing myself to be led, is to STFU. just STFU! Keep it to yourself, and you will give him the room to lead and you can relax and enjoy it. :)\n\n3. VET VET VET!! Read the vetting series on here, and then read it 5 more times. And read it every time you meet a new man and are interested. Just because you have a connection with someone doesn\u2019t mean that they are the one for you. You need to make sure they will be a good long term partner and you need to know what to look for. None of these skills will help if you choose a bad partner. \n\n4. Look your best. Men loving having a beautiful woman on their arm. Do what you can to improve your looks, and it will make a difference. Get your eyebrows done (micro blading is great), do your lashes (perm), dress for your body type, do your hair nicely (even if it\u2019s just a slick back bun), and put on a bit of makeup when you go out, and obviously watch your weight. I really liked the looksmaxxing info that I could find on Reddit, and gave me ideas on how to look my best. \n\n5. Be affectionate. This is another HUGE one. Keep your sex life exciting and spontaneous and make your partner feel that he couldn\u2019t get better sex with anyone else! Be excited about participating in sex, and give him kisses and hugs often and unexpectedly. Be open to new things and accepting of his desires. I know this one is controversial for people \u2014 but I rarely rarely ever reject my partner for sex. And he has expressed how much he appreciates and loves this about me. You should never do something you are uncomfortable with, but you should find a man that you do want to be sexual with! This one is key. If a man is going to commit to you, he is giving up having sex with other people, and you\u2019re his only source. Therefore, you need to provide this to him (unless there are medical reasons, etc.)\n\nLong post, but thanks for reading. I love this community so much, and like I said, it changed my life. So I wanted to give back and hopefully help some other ladies out there that are looking for their dream man \u2764\ufe0f","title":"Be pleasant + Allow yourself to be led + VET + Look your best + be affectionate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/19asu4z\/be_pleasant_allow_yourself_to_be_led_vet_look\/"}

Now, on to the field report.\n\nBackground: I didn\u2019t have a 16 week appointment at my OBGYN due to a scheduling error on their part\u2014they called me to tell me they had to cancel my 16 week appointment, then on the day it was originally supposed to happen they left me a message a 2 hours before the original time saying \u201cactually, it\u2019s back on\u201d then labeled me a no-show when I didn\u2019t go. They then discharged me from their practice. When I called about it, they berated me about it a bit and then said the doctor would be kind enough to \u201clet me back in if I don\u2019t miss any other appointments.\u201d This upset me, as it wasn\u2019t my fault, but I agreed anyway. Also important, I am in recovery from an eating disorder which I disclose every appointment, I grew up in a verbally abusive household, and I very much dislike conflict.\n\nSituation: I went to my 20 week appointment with my fianc\u00e9, the intake nurse brought up the \u201cno show\u201d appointment and was very snippy to show she disapproved. My fianc\u00e9 was unhappy, but I told him, \u201chey, maybe she\u2019s just having a bad day.\u201d \n\nThen the doctor shows up and tells me I\u2019ve gained 10 pounds (which really isn\u2019t okay, as my eating disorder is documented in my file). This was very upsetting to me, and my fianc\u00e9 said coolly, \u201cwhich is good, right doctor?\u201d And the doctor dismissed it saying, \u201cyeah, it\u2019s fine going in the second trimester.\u201d \n\nThe doctor then proceeds to berate me over the \u201cno show appointment\u201d saying I missed the deadline for checking on my baby\u2019s spine and that he doesn\u2019t want to be held responsible for my inaction on my baby\u2019s behalf if anything goes wrong or my baby is deformed. I feel my fianc\u00e9\u2019s anger at this, and he steps in front of me protectively and tells the doctor with anger tenuously suppressed that I wasn\u2019t a no show, that we have voicemails with dates and times to prove it, and that he is being extremely disrespectful to me. \n\nThe doctor refuses to listen and gets angry saying, \u201ceven if that we\u2019re true, which it isn\u2019t since I have it in my notes what happened, we had to call her to reschedule which she didn\u2019t respond to (*note, I was sick for a week and wasn\u2019t able to call during that time).

While anyone here is of course free to believe what they want and follow whatever movement they like, it\u2019s unproductive for us to constantly defend feminism *here* of all places, particularly when using choice feminism as a justification.\n\nThe thing about \u201cchoice feminism\u201d is that it has never been a part of the feminist movement, from its \u201cnoble\u201d first-wave origins to today\u2019s third- and fourth-wave radical feminism. There *IS* an explicit hostility and condescension towards women wanting marriage, children, and families in feminism, and to deny that as just \u201cextremism\u201d is to pretend that those sentiments aren\u2019t built into the foundations of the entire movement.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir, who in 1949 wrote \u201cThe Second Sex\u201d aka the book so foundational to the feminist movement that some call it \u201cthe feminist bible\u201d, has said:\n\n> \u201cNo woman should be authorized to stay at home to raise her children. Society should be totally different. **Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one.**\u201d\n\nBetty Friedan, who in 1963 wrote \u201cThe Feminine Mystique\u201d aka the monumental book that kicked off second-wave feminism, has said:\n\n> \"I am convinced there is something about the housewife state itself that is dangerous\u201d\n\nand\n\n>\u201dthe women who 'adjust' as housewives, who grow up wanting to be 'just a housewife,' are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camps. . . .'\u201d\n\nand \n\n>\u201dA woman today who has no goal, no purpose, no ambition patterning her days into the future, making her stretch and grow beyond that small score of years in which her body can fill its biological function, **is committing a kind of suicide..**\u201d\n\nBefore ending her own life, Sylvia Plath wrote \u201cThe Bell Jar\u201d, a roman \u00e0 clef novel that went on to become \u201crequired reading\u201d for feminists and gender studies, which said:\n\n>\u201d\u201cSo I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterward you went about as numb as a slave in a totalitarian state.**\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much \u201cchoice\u201d in these quotes and positions if it doesn\u2019t align with \u201cfemale liberation\u201d from the \u201cshackles\u201d of marriage and childrearing. There\u2019s also a clear disdain towards the women who choose to prioritize marriage, children, and homemaking, as well as the institution of marriage and the nuclear family itself - we are often seen as unenlightened Uncle Toms (or I guess Auntie Tommies?) who are willing perpetrators of our own \u201coppression\u201d, simply for deciding to live the way we want to, and for having the audacity to feel good about it.\n\nWhen these are the sentiments that are engrained within the core of the movement, it is incredibly hard, and I\u2019d argue impossible, to move away from them. Even today, just a simple google search of the words \u201cchoice feminism\u201d alone has these articles as the first- and second-page results:\n\n- [Choice Feminism: New and Hip, but Not Necessarily Good](https:\/\/upennfword.com\/2019\/11\/04\/choice-feminism\/amp\/)\n\n- [It's Time to Move Past Choice Feminism](https:\/\/www.34st.com\/article\/2021\/01\/feminism-choice-liberal-patriarchy-misogyny-bimbo-capitalism) \n\n- [Do Women really have a \u201cChoice\u201d in Choice Feminism](https:\/\/sayfty.com\/the-choice-in-choice-feminism\/)\n\n- [Choice Feminism: a Self-Imposed Barrier to Progress?](https:\/\/feminisminindia.com\/2019\/09\/17\/choice-feminism-self-imposed-barrier-progress\/?amp)\n\n- [No - feminism is not about choice](https:\/\/theconversation.com\/amp\/no-feminism-is-not-about-choice-40896)\n\n- [The Problem with Choice Feminism](https:\/\/whitmanwire.com\/opinion\/2021\/04\/01\/the-problem-with-choice-feminism\/)\n\n- [Choice Feminism and the Fear of Politics](https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/perspectives-on-politics\/article\/abs\/choice-feminism-and-the-fear-of-politics\/E6BD4B851D564D34312391F8F9692FCE)\n\n- [The Failure of \u201cChoice Feminism\u201d](https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2017\/03\/i-am-not-feminist-jessa-crispin-review\/)\n\n- [Choice Feminism: Time to \u2018Choose\u2019 Another Argument](http:\/\/feministing.com\/2015\/05\/07\/choice-feminism-time-to-choose-another-argument\/)\n\nUnless we choose to do the things that the feminist movement actively endorses, it\u2019s clear that choice feminism has ultimately failed to create a safe space for marriage- and family-oriented women within feminism. It is not taken seriously within the larger movement, and we continue to be treated with hostility and contempt for living lives the way *we* want to. To say you are a feminist because you are a choice feminist is to give credit to a larger movement that does not support women\u2019s freedom to choose.\n\nBeyond think pieces and essays and novels about choice feminism, it\u2019s also clear that there are everyday micro-aggressions and condescensions from feminists towards women who choose to prioritize marriage and their families.\n\nFeminist political strategist and commentator Hillary Rosen said that Ann Romney \u201chas not worked a day in her life\u201d in an attempt to invalidate her ability to speak for women\u2019s issues as a potential First Lady. When asked about her law career and the priority she and her husband placed on her law firm, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies, and had teas,\u201d as if stay-at-home-motherhood is as frivolous as that. Jill Filapovic, a regular contributor to mainstream media like NYT, CNN, The Washington Post, Time, and The Guardian, has said:\n\n>\u201dMore mothers at home makes for worse, more sexist men who see women as mommies and helpmeets. Men with stay-at-home wives are more sexist than men with working wives\u201d\n\nand\n\n>\u201dMarriage confers tangible benefits to men, and far fewer to women.\u201d\n\nand\n\n\u201cHaving children is one of the worst things you can do for the planet. Have one less and conserve resources.\u201d\n\nThese are **not** weird, fringe, radical, or extremist views. These are far from the only instances of this kind of resentment of mothers and marriage. This **is** feminism. This is why, among other reasons^1, RPW is **explicitly** an anti-feminist community. The only thing that is true of all RPWs is that we all want male-led relationships, and that we are not afraid to prioritize (or at least realize the importance of) said relationships in our lives. As a result, we have MANY women here who are happy to be wives, to raise children, and to stay home to prioritize their families. RPW is and will always be an anti-feminist community because we want to foster a safe space for these women to REALLY be able to choose what path they want, without the mockery, the condescension, the disdain, and the wrath.\n\n*****\n^1: This post couldn\u2019t even **begin** to tackle how anti-male sentiments are incredibly pervasive and commonplace in the feminist movement. That would turn this already long post into a book-length essay. Feminist anti-male rhetoric is obviously unproductive here as well, because we want male-led relationships and recognize that men *complement* us in many desirable ways. In order for that to happen, we have to work *with men* as [teammates](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6hkgqv\/you_are_a_team\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and not *against them* as adversaries.","title":"Does feminism really mean \u2018the right to choose\u2019?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/u9rxmt\/does_feminism_really_mean_the_right_to_choose\/"}

And although there is truth to this concept, I think the root cause is not that female beauty rapidly decreases from 30+ but that most women never learned to compete (for HVM) in their 20s.\n\nI'll elaborate: Women in their late teens\/early-mid twenties are a very highly sought after 'product'. It's not particularly hard to get into a LTR with a decent guy their age, especially if you're a young woman above average in attractiveness you hold a lot of leverage in the sexual marketplace.\n\nThe necessity for women in this age bracket to cultivate other traits like femininity, cooperation, submissiveness is low because they don't need it to keep a man\/men around. By the time they reach their late twenties\/early-mid 30s their beauty starts fading and these traits become more important. (Men will gladly go down in looks to go up in cooperation) Not having developed these skills, suddenly they cannot hold the attention from the quality of men they dated in their 20s any longer. \n\nAt the same time men their own age start gaining more leverage as they become more successful in their careers, better social skills, more maturity etc. This is what TRP refers to as 'The Wall' the revelation that as a woman the quality of men you can get goes down as age goes up. To me however, it's more so about never having learned to compete for men, never having to have had put in effort to keep a man around. Not having learned to cook, massage, be sweet, cooperative, feminine, not having a good gym routine in place etc. These things are essential to learn in your 20s because *you want to learn things before you need them, not after.* \n\nA question I think is worth pondering; '*How would I keep my man if another (objectively more attractive) woman set his eyes on him?*' You should have a good answer to that question differentiating yourself from other women if you want a high quality man in your life and keep him long term.

If anyone out there has (or had!) a bad picker, would like to hear your thoughts on how you selected your mates, and if you've ever consciously or subconsciously changed it. Anyway, here's the deets!\n\n\n**Change Yourself**\n\nMake a list of everything about yourself you are unhappy with and pick a Top 5 to tackle. Make sure they aren't nebulous - e.g. \"I'm not very nice\" is a terrible goal. Set something *measurable* and achievable. If the goal seems impossible after a month, reduce the goal and try again. E.g., do x new hobby on Wednesdays, run 5km on Saturdays and Sundays, etc.\n\n\n**Self Moderate**\n\nStop consuming bad media. Including trashy song lyrics, trashy TV shows, trashy social media, trashy experiences, anything that makes you go \"Hmm, this will probably rot my brain if I consume enough of it\". Eventually you'll catch yourself saying things you don't agree with, and that's fine! It means it's working. You'll begin to change the way you think and speak. But it must start from removing bad outside influences.\n\u00a0\n\n**Change your friends**\n\nSimilar to avoiding bad influences. Get rid of all the ones you don't really like. Make up an excuse 3x in a row when they want to hang out and it should be enough. Additionally, stop talking to such people even as casual acquaintances beyond a polite \"Hello, How are you?\"\u00a0\n\n\n**Start actively looking for positive traits in people and telling them**\n\nBoth men and women, everyone. Start recognising what individual aspects make them good (and bad). Don't be afraid to judge people, very critically, and figure out what it is exactly that makes them bad and good. Figure out where your feelings of admiration and repulsion come from, and explore them, and test them. Finally, say them out loud: \"Hey <friend or acquaintance or family member>, I really like how you _________. I admire you very much for it.\" And keep noticing good things! Bad things don't need to be said out loud. You can write those in a journal instead, but it's important to at least find out why you think they're bad.\n\n\n**Discover what makes men masculine**\n\nYou're going to fall for them, so figure out what makes men different to women. What are men better at than women? Why? What do you admire in a man but not in a woman? What do you admire in a woman but not in a man? The biggest BP lie is not that men and women are the same, it is that *they can be the same*. Why do men thrive on danger, but women avoid it? Why do women dislike STEM subjects, even when they're good at them? Why don't men care about the difference between cool red and warm red? Hint: [it's not upbringing.](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Reimer)\u00a0\n\nSimply noticing these differences is enough to begin with. Eventually you'll notice some amazing things about masculinity and learn to appreciate it and seek it out.\n\n\n**Define three things you want in a man and compare men you know against these traits**\n\n*Don't* make these superficial characteristics like looks or sexual attraction. Instead, make them characteristics, i.e. \"intelligent, brave, good leader\" etc. Aim high, but only three traits. Then go through men you know and honestly compare them against these traits. Come up with specific examples of their actions that show they meet them\/don't meet them. I started with three that were most important to me, and it seemed impossible to find men that matched all three. My current boyfriend, however, does, and I wasn't even conscious of it at first.\n\n\n**Background**\u00a0\n\nSince doing the above, I have changed the kind of person I am attracted to. I used to dislike masculine men, and liked feminine or dandyish men, which was a problem if I want to feel safe and protected. I used to feel a great connection with misanthropes but now I instinctively avoid them. I also aimed low and didn't quite know what I wanted. I liked men that would be too distant from me, whereas I need affection and affirmation. I used to crush on people that I knew were not good enough for me to be with. So it's quite a big jump from that to my current boyfriend, who is everything I admire, respect and need.\n\nI believe the above steps helped me the most and I wanted to share here, because vetting is useless if you're attracted to the wrong type of person in the first place.\u00a0\n\nAnd remember,\n\n***Attraction is not negotiable!***","title":"How To Change The Kind of Man You Are Attracted To","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/l2ixof\/how_to_change_the_kind_of_man_you_are_attracted_to\/"}

Everything was my fault (or my dad's if that poor soul is at home) and anything less than perfect is not good enough. Without trauma dumping too much, it was basically the perfect breeding ground for a girl who finds safety in instability, craves control and needs others to be wrong in order to feel okay.\n\nEven then, persistent self-improvement and applying the following strategies helped me achieve the best relationship I could possibly ask for. I am still definitely a work in progress, and everything below is just my personal experience. It may not work for you the same way it worked for me, but I hope it helps a little!\n\n# Pre-requisites\n\nIf you come from a background like mine, I think you need the following before even getting into a relationship:\n\n* You have recognised that the way you want to treat men and the relationship modelled for you is not okay. It's hurtful to both you and him. It's fine if you don't know what it should look like quite yet, as long as you're open to learning.\n* You understand there is value in stability, even if you are uncomfortable with it. Childhood instability is the whole reason why I was like that, why would I want it to continue? (i.e. please don't go for alpha chads who treat you like shit while vetting, break the cycle!)\n* Most people are good, decent people. If you treat them well, they will try their best to treat you well.\n* Understand that you can learn healthier coping mechanisms\n* Ideally, have a good therapist and great friends.\n\nIn short, be willing to improve and have faith that things could be good.\n\nMost importantly, understand that treating people badly will result in a bad relationship (what a concept right), even if you have good intentions deep down! In other words, if you love him, sound like it and act like it. Love & be lovable <3\n\n(p.s. I'm not writing about vetting here. This advice is assuming you have found a good, reliable man and you two love & respect each other.)\n\n# 1 - STFU\n\nThis literally saved me so many times. Regardless of how hurtful and vile your thoughts are, you can't hurt anyone if you don't say them!\n\nThe two situations I default to STFU are\n\n**He is doing something and I have \\~opinions\\~ about it**\n\nUnless the opinion is \"Wait babe you forgot to unplug it\" (i.e. literal danger), it's usually pretty rude and disrespectful to say anything. I ask myself these questions before saying anything:\n\n1. Has he done this before and does he seem capable of doing it? If so, STFU\n2. If he (or god forbid my mum) said this to me, would I be mad? If so, STFU\n3. Do I want to start doing this instead of him? If not, STFU. \"You can ask me to do it or show me how it's done, but not both.\"\n4. Had this been when we first started dating, would I have had the same complaint, or just found it sweet? If it's sweet in the first 3 months, it's sweet now, STFU.\n5. Does it matter at all? Is what I'm about to say important? Is saying something worth a potential argument? No? STFU\n\n**I will sound like I'm attributing blame.**\n\nI still struggle with this at times, because this only happens when there is already external stress. For example, if we are about to miss a flight and I start going \"omg I can't believe this is happening, how would we recover, we should have left earlier, blah blah blah\" - great, I sound like I just blamed him in 3 different ways and he feels even worse. I think this type of behaviour is what men mean by \"it feels like everything is my fault\".\n\nMy best strategy is if I *really* need to express something, then I should dig for the base emotion and express that instead. In the above example, what I am actually feeling is fear that it's my fault and fear that the vacation is ruined. All I want is some reassurance that it's going to be okay. If I said the above, he would have been sulking or annoyed, and I would not have gotten any of that reassurance. Instead, I should just say \"Aah I am worried this is my fault, I hope I didn't ruin the vacation\". Chances are, instead of being annoyed, he would go \"It's not your fault baby, it will be okay\", which is all I wanted.\n\nAlso, if something is indeed his fault, also STFU. He probably feels horrible about it already, no need to make it worse.\n\n**Obviously, STFU if you are about to pick a fight or say something you know is going to cause a reaction**. The urge will pass and one day it will never come again. Trust me. Some women just want to feel good right this moment, right now, and they don't care about the damage that could cause in the long term. It's seriously not worth it. \n\n\n\n# 2 - Express Gratitude + Compliment Him\n\nMy mindset around it is this: if he does something (no matter how mundane), and you want him to keep doing it, thank him and compliment him for it. Sometimes I tell my husband I'm so grateful the lights are on even though I never paid a single utility bill in my entire life. Other things I thank + compliment him for include:\n\n* Any chores he does. This might be why he forbids me from doing the dishes so he can do them sometimes.\u00a0\n* when he pays the bill at restaurants, or anytime he buys me stuff\n* making me laugh (\u201comg how did I marry the funniest man alive I love you so much\u201d)\u00a0\n* any time he is extra patient with me\u00a0\n* any time he compliments me\n* sex\n* gifts, dates, and vacations. Please don't be that person who tells off their partner for giving them a gift, a good way to guarantee no more gifts again. Receive graciously!\n* general things like my lifestyle, happiness, and mental health, \"if it weren't for you, I'd never been able to do ...\"\n\nSometimes I manufacture silly little opportunities to thank him too, like asking him to open a jar even if I could myself.\n\nI want to bring up a very toxic mindset I grew up seeing: the idea that if you compliment someone, they will think they are doing enough, and thus stop trying(??) It makes no sense and people don't work like this. They will only want to do more, not less.\n\nIf it's something I'd thank a stranger for, I will also thank him. Some people treat people the closest to them much worse than how they treat strangers. That, again, makes no sense.\n\n\n\n# 3 - Apologise when you're wrong\n\nA good apology has these parts: 1. I did \\_\\_\\_ and it was wrong\/rude\/disrespectful, 2. I am sorry, thanks for telling me, 3. it won't happen again + how. What I found when I did this was:\n\n* it undoes the failure to STFU. A lot of times not STFU is disrespectful. Apologising reinstills that respect.\n* he feels comfortable apologising to me\n* we grow closer because of it\n* we can fully resolve the issue, meaning resentment won't build up, and old issues are never brought up in new arguments\n\nScary stuff, I know. I think the central fear I had around this was that he would somehow use this as an opportunity to gloat and hold it over me, making me lose all control in the process. If that's a genuine fear, I suggest using it as a vetting strategy.  If he doesn't the first time, he's probably not going to do it in the future either.\n\nThe first time I apologised to my husband, maybe a month or so into us dating, he was in so much shock that the issue was immediately forgiven and resolved. He was so used to girls making everything his fault. Honestly, my heart broke a little for him, and I fully realised just how much damage I could do to him if I wanted to. It made me more certain of my resolve to work on these mental issues.\n\nSomething I realised is that my inability to take responsibility and apologise & my tendency to lash out had a lot to do with self-hatred. Anything I perceived as my fault sent me into a self-protective overdrive. My self-esteem was so low that I couldn't possibly accept any more blame. This improved as my mental health gradually got better, but I also realised what I actually wanted was to be told that it's okay and this mistake does not make me unlovable. Apologising and being forgiven actually gives me that.\n\n\n\n# 4 - Surrender control\n\nEven scarier! However, I found that this is so important to help my partner \"lead\" and be engaged. If you read my previous post, I am incredibly taken care of and provided for, and my husband almost always puts my interests before his. I think surrendering some control has a lot to do with that.\n\nOther benefits include being much less anxiety-ridden and stressed out because you know someone who loves you very much has got your back. It also creates a lot of opportunities for gratitude and bonding.\n\nDo note that I am not talking about being a doormat and having no clue where the family money is going and no emergency savings. For example, I have my own credit, savings, and investments. All of our family finances are on joint accounts I have access to, etc.\n\nThis was a slow, step-by-step process for me, looking something like this:\n\n1. Practised not controlling \\*his\\* life, i.e. what he does with his time, how he does things, etc (STFU is a part of this) I say \"whatever you want\", \"whatever you think is good\", \"whatever makes you happy\" a lot, when he is clearly looking for validation and not advice.\n2. I made room for him to \"step up\" and be an engaged partner. I don't plan everything despite the urge to do so and I ask him for his opinion in an accepting way.\n3. I asked him if he could be so kind as to take over some of the things I am really bad at, I'd be \\*really\\* grateful. He is in charge of stuff like finances, navigation, and throwing out the trash, and he seems really happy to do it.\n4. I do everything he asks me to, as long as I can handle it. If he's sitting on the couch and he asks for a drink, you bet I'm getting that drink and coming back all excited. I think to some extent this makes him extra considerate of how his decisions and actions affect me.\n\nMindset shifts that helped me implement this process:\n\n* It's a trauma response and not normal to want to control someone else's every move. It's ineffective and will likely lead to the cycle of abuse continuing.\n* Men, at least this man, actually want to provide and make women happy. My happiness and gratitude make him happy too, so our interests are fundamentally aligned here and I have nothing to worry about. \n* This guy is objectively intelligent and capable. \n* Understood that a lot of things are not that big of a deal compared to the general health and happiness of my relationship.\n* I told myself that if I couldn't trust my husband, then I should at least trust my own taste in men.\n* If I get really, really in my head, I just tell myself that giving up control is an [effective manipulation tactic](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/80ryqx\/submissive_behaviour_as_strategy\/). If I had to be crazy, at least be crazy in an effective way.\n\n\n\n# 5 - Take care of yourself and your mood\n\nMy mood affects the mood of the whole house. My relationship definitely improved as my depressive episodes lessened. Eating well, exercising, and going outside really do wonders. If you like science-based self-improvement content, I enjoy putting the Huberman podcast in the background.\n\nA valuable lesson I learned in therapy is how to regulate my emotions in a healthy way. Instead of seeking safety in control and winning fights, I can seek safety in cuddles, music, a good show, and other positive interactions. Once I refrained from those insane highs and lows, I found my tolerance of it went way down and I no longer seek it out.\n\nAlso, I am in a much better mood when I am intellectually and aesthetically fulfilled. If I give myself time to pursue my interests, read, do my projects, and indulge in pretty things, I am so much happier.\n\nOne of my husband's favourite things about me is how I find so much wonder and joy in the little things in the world, like a particularly pretty birdsong or a cute puppy. My delight seems to directly translate to his delight, so I try to be delighted often. \n\n\n\n# 6 - Never get angry (childlike anger and response)\n\nI want to touch on anger as the most unattractive and useless emotion. For me, anger is rarely the \"real\" feeling, but rather sadness, fear, or hurt in disguise. Expressing anger instead of those actual emotions never results in what I want. Time and time again it is proven to me that being mad will only make things worse. \n\nIn my experience, harsh tones and impatience are always met with equally harsh tones. If all I want is an apology or to be comforted, my husband getting agitated or annoyed by how harsh I'm being is the last thing I need. If it's a serious issue and he has hurt me, I will digest it and STFU until the anger has cleared and I can see how I am truly feeling, and convey that.\n\nIt was daunting at first to abandon anger because it feels like a good \"shield\" from those uncomfortable emotions. However, I remind myself that it's ultimately ineffective and has literally never helped in the past, so why do it again?\n\nI'm a pretty cutesy person in real life, so if I really had to express frustration, expressing anger in a childlike way always worked well for me. It releases the frustration and it gets me the comfort or validation that I'm seeking in the first place because he thinks I'm being super cute.\n\nI lean into my cutesy nature a lot. My husband really likes it (in that I am very lucky). Some men may not so your mileage may vary. It's a really good way to de-escalate situations and make us feel closer immediately.\n\n[Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/c10eob\/book_club_fascinating_womanhood_introduction_to\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/o8wgu3\/playful_bashfulness_my_secret_weapon_to_melting\/) are great resources on this idea.\n\n\n\n# 7 - Sex!!\n\nIn the 5 years we've been together, I have never turned him down even once (aside from health concerns). We have done everything we're into or curious about, and we continue to spice it up every now and then. This is mostly because my sex drive is pretty high, and I have a more libertine view of it than most. \n\nI have always felt like you don't need to be in the mood for sex to have sex. My husband takes me to the mall when I ask him to and I doubt he is in the mood for the mall ever. Personally, I also found it pretty easy to get into the mood once it starts. I am somewhat lucky that I grew up in a very sex-positive place, so even though my first time was with my husband (then boyfriend), I never struggled with being too conservative about sex.\n\nHere are some of the things I do:\n\n* Always say yes when I am physically able to\n* I make it easy for him to initiate (e.g. asking for massages and cuddles before bed)\n* I am an incredibly enthusiastic and active participant, both physically and verbally. \n* I put up a good show to keep it fun - sometimes I go full slut mode, sometimes I act a bit coy, etc\n* I try to improve and learn (practice new tricks, and new positions, & ask for feedback. r\/sex is a good resource)\n* I am grateful for his effort and participation and I let him know, it's a lot of work!\n* I also express a lot of admiration for him (you can imagine how)\n* I am pretty open about my kinks and fantasies and I am very accepting of his, even if I'm not super into them\n* I try to keep it sexy in everyday life by always being a little flirty\n* I try to keep it sexually dimorphic when possible, for lack of a better term. I've found the stronger the contrast between us, the better the sex. I won't get into any kinky stuff here, but there are ways to make him feel extra masculine and strong, and me extra feminine and \\~weak\\~, so the sex is extra fun. \n\nThe way I think about it, it's literally a zero-cost way to show *deep* appreciation for your partner in a way you know he would like. It should also be comfortable if not equally as pleasurable for you (or else go see a doctor). It's also a great way for you to feel closer to him and make your feelings for him stronger.\n\nI remember one day I was being extra attentive, and he just went \"Wow, you must really love me\". Hehe, yes I do.\n\n\n\n# 8 - Basic Attractiveness and Skills (homemaking, appearance, etc.)\n\nMy personal experience (which might not be entirely in alignment with this sub), is you only need to be decent enough at these things such that\n\n1. There are one or two things you're great at\n2. Both you and your partner find the rest acceptable\n3. It's makes you happy and gives you confidence\n\nThere is no need to twist yourself into a knot trying to looksmaxx or something like that. I take care of my appearance but I am not a model by any stretch. I love cooking and I'm great at it, but our place is not spotless. If I'm hotter and the house is cleaner, would he love me more? Probably, but it's certainly not a hard requirement for a good relationship. Most of my issues were clearly personality-based, so I spent most of my time on that instead. There is definitely room for improvement for me here.\n\nHere are the things I personally focus on to make myself more attractive:\n\n* Cooking & baking - it's a hobby and I love his reactions to my food every time.\n* A great skincare routine + a pretty no-makeup makeup look that emphasises my features\n* pretty hair + smell nice\n* a good wardrobe with durable, high-quality pieces that complement my personality\n* relentless self-improvement. Once I'm fully done with mental health issues, I think I will move on to fitness.\n* my own career + interests. Men do want to provide but I don't think they want dead weight. \n\n\n\n--\n\nThat wraps up most of what I do. It's preventative maintenance - most of these things came easy during the honeymoon period, and I am determined to keep doing them regardless of how long we have been married. It has worked so far, and I hope it will work for the rest of my life. One of my biggest flexes is nothing changed when we got married - I kept doing all these things, and he kept being amazingly loving and nice to me. (My second biggest flex is probably his enthusiasm to wife me up ASAP haha.)\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far. Sorry for how long this post got. I hope it provided something of value.

When you had intense feelings for each other? A time when you couldn't let go of each other, and you were constantly on each other's mind. Perhaps you are in that stage right now. Everything about your partner is exciting. Like most things, that does come to an end. That however is not the problem, the problem is, some people get stuck in that period, thinking it is meant to be like that forever and to feel the excitement that they first felt, they get caught up in a never-ending task of trying to relive or recreate that moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe honeymoon stage while dating is important. It keeps you interested in someone long enough to know them and decide whether you want to pursue something long-term or not. It's in this period that you catch yourself thinking about what a future with the said person might look like. When the thoughts are promising, you might find yourself actively becoming more involved in their lives and wanting to start a life together. It's also during this time that we realize that the said person might not be good for us, but some people choose to ignore that (and choose to convince themselves how people can change, or they can accept the flaws in them) in pursuit of the emotional happiness that they are getting at the moment, but that is a story for another day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the honeymoon stage is over, at some point you'll have to make a conscious decision to commit or let go. There will always be happy moments where you'll find loving your partner more than you've ever had or having deep contempt for them, but it is important to know that you might never feel the same excitement or emotional high you did while you were dating. Some might think that is bad, but it isn't. After you realize that trying to chase that feeling is like trying to go back to the Garden of Eden, which is impossible, you are left with the choice to grow and explore. And therein, lies your joy and wonder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeyond the Garden of Eden, there is a lot to explore, a lot of things that will make your mind wonder with joy, and land to grow and create beautiful crafts together. Or you can choose to get stuck, unable to grow and move on and instead remain at the edges of the garden looking into what was, hoping to get back in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd therein lies the difference between people with successful relationships and people with a multitude of failed relationships. After the excitement is over, some people, knowing that they can have a future together, decide to explore the unknown and nurture their love and compassion for each other while creating new memories and getting even new feelings they didn't even get to feel before. This requires commitment and hard work, constantly having to check with each other and comparing notes. But you work through that, and you'll always be in a safe and happy garden no matter the circumstances because you choose to toil and grow. While this might be less exciting, it usually evolves into a meaningful and intimate relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other couple on the other hand, having lost the excitement of the honeymoon stage, will try to do things that made them happy repeatedly hoping that it'll get them emotionally attached again. But that'll never happen, and unable to take the time to scratch below the surface and make a commitment despite knowing that a person might be right for them, they'll walk away to go find someone else who'll make them feel alive again. Someone who'll make them feel that excitement that they once felt. For those unable to move on, they find themselves stuck in an unfulfilling, emotionally unhealthy or toxic relationship. And the cycle continues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it's only often in dire times that people realize that they didn't allow themselves to grow and connect with people beyond the surface of what was seen and what was. It's at that time that one realizes that all they have is a list of people they spent moments with, without really connecting. All that held them together was the pleasure that brought them together, and after it was gone, so was the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what can you do differently? Avoid superficial connections. During and after the honeymoon stage, it is important to let people know who you are and also allows people to express who they are. If you can love them, and they can love you and still feel safe in that space, the world opens up to endless possibilities. Connecting and forming relationships takes time. It involves shading your skin and breaking down the walls that guard you and letting some people in. If all you share with people is a facade, because you are scared of what people might think of your flaws, you'll never really feel like you belong. You'll never connect because a part of you will always be in hiding.","title":"Stop Chasing the Honeymoon Phase","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/110ihtf\/stop_chasing_the_honeymoon_phase\/"}

While they seem pretty in line with traditional relationships where the man leads, there is one BIG pitfall with this mindset.\n\n\u2014\n\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss what a HVM even is.\n\nIf we just look at the words, a High Value Man has to be a man worth high value. Does this mean he has to have a lot of wealth? Or that he\u2019s highly coveted by other women in the sexual\/dating marketplace? Or do we take the word \u201cvalue\u201d to mean morals and character?\n\nWhile the general consensus does have *something* to do with his [resources](https:\/\/youtu.be\/eb8NfHHPMh4), [demand](https:\/\/variety.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/bach-4.jpg), and [character](https:\/\/www.azquotes.com\/vangogh-image-quotes\/67\/77\/Quotation-Aristotle-It-is-our-choice-of-good-or-evil-that-determines-67-77-80.jpg), an individual\u2019s definition of a HVM is gonna be pretty different on a case-by-case basis and will vary in her stances\/expectations on these three things. A bohemian woman might see a zen [yoga instructor](https:\/\/imgix.bustle.com\/rehost\/2016\/9\/13\/e9bfeddc-0416-4147-a889-662fba58433d.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;crop=faces&amp;amp;auto=format%2Ccompress) who\u2019s done a lot of work building his community as a HVM, but a woman who works in finance looking for a hardworking [superstar on Wall Street](http:\/\/cdn.totalfratmove.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/0ec0bb5d156fd76f8ecd490118c7c0c4.jpg) with an assertive and pragmatic outlook will probably not. A Christian woman may fawn over the God-fearing [pious man](https:\/\/websterunitedmethodist.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/iStock-613021846.jpg) with little to no sexual and dating experience, but an atheist sorority sister going to school in a liberal state might pass on him for the exciting [student body president](https:\/\/www.refinery29.com\/images\/8482890.jpg) who has a strong network and vibrant social life (and extensive sexual history).\n\nI firmly believe that all these women and everyone in between could benefit from RPW strategies. From my observations, the common link between these seemingly disparate kinds of men are the **desirable masculine behavioral traits** responsible for the success they found in their different lifestyles. While we may not all love the yogi, we *do* admire stoicism and a mastery of emotional control. While some might think the finance bro is a douchebag, we *can* all appreciate passion, drive\/dedication, and cleverness. While we may not share the same beliefs as the Christian man, we *do* respect men who are unwavering what they believe in. And while we might not necessarily be interested in the student body president, we *are* drawn to those with strong leadership skills and magnetic personas. \n\n(Some food for thought: what are some other desirable masculine behavioral traits that the vast majority of women look for in a man?)\n\nThat\u2019s how we all want different types of men, but still have SOME shared understanding of what a HVM is. **At the end of the day, a HVM for the intents and purposes of YOUR RPW journey is simply a man with DESIRABLE MASCULINE BEHAVIORAL TRAITS that manifest in a way that fits your goals, lifestyle, morals, and preferences.**\n\n\u2014\n\nSo now that we know what a HVM is, let\u2019s break down why those sentiments I mentioned earlier are fallacious and unproductive.\n\nWhat do all those statements, and anything else along those lines, have in common with each other? **They all place the onus on the HVM to do something that would benefit YOU**. Why is this a bad thing? Isn\u2019t RPW all about finding men who have a protective instinct towards you? Hunting down a man who wants to take care of you?\n\n*Kind of.*\n\nYes, we absolutely **want** men to protect and provide for us, to lead us through times of hardship and prosperity. But trying to **find** a man who\u2019s automatically ready to protect and and provide for you? Who\u2019s chivalrous and caring from the get go? With that definition, we\u2019re not looking for a man\u2019s *desirable masculine behavioral traits* anymore. The definition of a HVM from those statements at the top of this post is more akin to a Buzzfeed listicle of what constitutes a \u201creal man\u201d (i.e. a man who does stuff that **I** want him to do for my benefit) than it is RPW strategy. With that mentality, you might as well add \u201cHVM don\u2019t care about your n-count\u201d or \u201conly HVM are willing to step up and become a step-father.\u201d You\u2019re more likely to end up single and alone with that list of demands that solely benefit you if you don\u2019t put in any work to make those demands into a reality. \n\n\u2014\n\nSo how do you create committed relationships with men who have a protective instinct for you? With men that want to prioritize you and provide for you? **You have to *inspire* him to want to commit, protect, prioritize, and provide.** This means that you don\u2019t go looking for men with innately chivalrous or protective or providing tendencies, but that the onus is on YOU to inspire commitment, protection, prioritization, and provision from an HVM (aka a man who shows *desirable masculine behavioral traits* that manifest in a way that fits your goals, lifestyle, morals, and preferences). \n\nHow do you do this?\n\n- [The bare necessities: keep his ego happy, balls empty, and stomach full](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/a6scr8\/3_simple_steps_to_keep_him_smitten_forever\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Be small, be cute, and stay close when danger is around](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/lzo0e1\/learning_about_the_male_protective_instinct_from\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Be childlike, not childish](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6k7y4y\/childlike_vs_childish\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Be a multifaceted RPW](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/75nj15\/how_to_the_multifaceted_rpw\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Be malleable](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/911iht\/malleability_and_you\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Use submissive behavior as strategy](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/80ryqx\/submissive_behaviour_as_strategy\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Use dread for women](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8lb51u\/dread_for_women\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Be nurturing](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/dannja\/the_power_of_chicken_soup\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Know the difference between appreciation and gratitude, and show both](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5swy8y\/appreciation_vs_gratitude\/)\n\n- [Have happy thoughts, use happy talk](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/dsr9ah\/happy_talk\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Cultivate a receptive spirit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/iauqvt\/cultivate_a_receptive_spirit\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Be his safe place to land](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/a497yc\/being_his_safe_place_to_land\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [Let him be the Captain...](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/69pi24\/the_captainfirst_mate_dynamic\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n- [...but also be a good First Mate](https:\/\/www.trp.red\/p\/fleetingwish\/795)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cBut what if I want a man whose *morals* dictate that he\u2019s marriage-minded and that he\u2019s chivalrous and that he protects and provides? Don\u2019t such men exist?\u201d\n\nSure they do (though they\u2019re rarer by the day). Some men were raised to always pay the bills, whether it\u2019s at the restaurant or for your house. Religious ones are actively looking for wives. Other men will choose to go to war or sacrifice their spot on the rescue boat simply because they believe that women and children need to be protected and prioritized.\n\nIf you\u2019re tradcon or religious, you\u2019ll probably be looking for these men anyways even though I told you not to, and in your circles, you might even find him! However, here\u2019s why you should work to *inspire* his commitment, protection, provisioning, and prioritization anyways: even though the sky would fall before these men stop picking up the bill or start thinking with an every-man-and-woman-for-themselves attitude, they still respond to a lack of feminine inspiration like all other men would - with resentment and contempt. \n\nSo sure, he\u2019ll continue to do all the things on your list of demands simply because he was raised that way. But you\u2019re gonna have to deal with a lot more fights, conflict, anger, and hostility from him because of your lack of effort and refusal to hold up your feminine end of the bargain. Continuing down this path is a surefire way to end up divorced or in a loveless marriage. \n\nSo if you MUST include this strategy of finding men whose morals make them protective of women, DON\u2019T lead with it. Instead, focus on the work YOU need to be doing to inspire him to stand by those morals. Wouldn\u2019t you rather he WANTED to do those things for you instead of feeling burdened or obligated to, by **inspiring** him with your girl game?\n\n\u2014\n\n**TLDR**: The term \u201cHVM\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201ca guy who does things for your benefit\u201d - it means a man who has desirable masculine behavioral traits that manifest in ways compatible with your goals, lifestyle, morals, and preferences. Knowing that, working to **inspire** a HVM\u2019s commitment, protection, prioritization, and provisions is the best way to get those things, and more importantly, to keep your HVM.","title":"This Definition of HVM Is Flawed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/p56val\/this_definition_of_hvm_is_flawed\/"}

I was friends with the guys and they all had secret crushes on her but were too scared to approach her. But when people complimented her or mentioned how good looking she was, she was incredibly humble about it and said that her looks didn\u2019t make her feel confident. She didn't have an ostentatious social media presence, which baffled me because if I had her face, I would\u2019ve been all over social media with it. But it was always the average to slightly below average girls who kept plastering their selfies on Instagram or Facebook or whatever. The good looking ones kept themselves low-key (a few of them waited until after high school to start a social media presence) And it was always the average to slightly below average girls getting boyfriends (who all had a secret crush on my friend) because I suppose those girls seemed more attainable to them. My friend wasn\u2019t popular and didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, but a lot of people (both guys and girls) would gush about how good looking she was behind her back. The \u201cpopular\u201d girls hated her though, probably because they would never be as good looking as her despite their popularity.\n\nAfter high school: I have dated around, both attractive and (conventionally) unattractive guys. What confuses me is when an incredibly attractive guy opens up to me about his insecurities and how he wants to improve his appearance... like what?! You look like you could be a model or movie star! Why the low self esteem??? And these attractive guys are less superficial about their choice in women than the unattractive guys. They would tell me that they like women of all sizes, women in all sizes can be beautiful and a good heart is what matters. But the unattractive (or conventionally unattractive) guys I have dated have ALL been so confident and comfortable about themselves and how they look, to the point of arrogance. They would even confess that they are happy with how they look. They would tell me that they could never date an ugly or fat woman and have confessed that they are incredibly superficial about appearances. These men would warn me that becoming fat and unattractive is a dealbreaker. But like bro... have you seen yourself?! I mean it would make sense if the attractive guys I date had this attitude because they are attractive and probably want someone equal to their attractiveness, but it\u2019s never them - it\u2019s always the less attractive guys with this attitude.

A little background on how I started working on making the most of my looks. I\u2019m pretty average looking in general but my face isn\u2019t the prettiest and I\u2019m not in great shape so I really started feeling down on myself a few months ago when I started reading about TRP and discovering how important looks are to men.\n\n\nSince then I\u2019ve started making just small improvements here and there, and I\u2019m already feeling WAY better and I\u2019ve been getting more attention\/compliments too! I thought I might as well share about what\u2019s worked for me, so here it is:\n\n*Please note that I\u2019m super low maintenance, I barely wear makeup or do much to my hair and I am not someone who can consistently go get her nails done every two weeks. I needed to find ideas that didn\u2019t involve too much fuss, and would look natural without much daily effort.\n\n\n1) gym. I am super inconsistent with exercise, but I realized a while ago that I have just enough time on my lunch break to go quickly to the small gym at work. I lift dumbbells and do short (10 minute) HIIT sessions which have been really helping me to tone up and lose fat. I only work out about 20-30 minutes, but doing that 3-4 times a week when it\u2019s already built in to my day (lunch hour) has really begun to make a difference. It also helps a lot with my mood!\n\n2) eyelash serum. There are a bunch of these you can buy online. I got RapidLash and it works great. Takes a few weeks of consistent use but my eyelashes are now WAY longer and thicker and people ask me if I have eyelash extensions when I wear mascara. You can also use it to fill in the hair growth in your brows!\n\n3) high end shampoo\/conditioner. I really did not want to do this one because I\u2019m generally pretty frugal and will buy the cheapest ones on sale at the drug store. But I went to get highlights a few weeks ago and the colourist told me that I needed to start using good quality (sulfate free\/silicone free) stuff so I saved up and bought some Davines brand. It has actually worked wonders and my hair is way healthier\/shinier.\n\n4) SKIN CARE!! I don\u2019t wear much makeup so I realized it\u2019s really important for me to have good skin. I started a consistent routine with a benzoyl peroxide face wash, aha\/bha exfoliant, retinol, rose hip oil and weleda skin food moisturizer. My skin has honestly never looked better and I almost think I reversed some signs of aging if that\u2019s possible?\n\n5) silk pillowcase. Hair is not as tangled and doesn\u2019t feel so dry\/breaky in the morning anymore. Helps a ton with frizz and shininess.\n\n6) press on nails. They have some really cute neutral ones for $15 at the drug store. You can cut them and shape them like real nails, and mine stay on for at least week at a time. There are some good videos on YouTube for how to make them last longer. Way more cost efficient than getting shellac or gel nails, and they don't chip so I don't have to redo them every other day like polish.\n\n8) hair bows\/scarves. I started experimenting with hair scarves and bows. There are a ton of different simple ways to wear them on Pinterest that are really classy and feminine and don\u2019t look tacky or overdone.\n\n9) \u201ctan-touring\u201d. This is basically contouring your face using a self tanning lotion and a makeup sponge. That way it stays for days even when you\u2019re not wearing makeup and it looks really natural. Some great tutorials on YouTube!\n\n\nI think that\u2019s it!! If I think of anything else I will come back. Feel free to add your own tips!\n","title":"A few ways to enhance your looks & femininity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/an8e2s\/a_few_ways_to_enhance_your_looks_femininity\/"}

I was always critiqued in school for only talking in class when I had something to say. \n\nThe idea of intelligence these days is often linked with cutthroat competition, corporate climbing, debating and shutting down the opposition, mic drop, etc.  \n\nBeing that competitive isn\u2019t conducive to love or friendships. \n\nIntelligence as valued by mainstream culture also is divorced from life wisdom, street smarts so to speak. \n\nI\u2019m certain men are very much interested in women who are practical and can handle life well, making wise choices that make things easier for the family.  \n\nSo far cry from sitting in an ivory tower insulting people\u2019s intellect.  Imagine having a PhD but no idea how to be frugal, negotiate, or judge character.   \n\nAs you can see, the modern idea of intelligence is divorced from femininity.   \n\nThink of a stereotype like a sexy nurse, librarian, or secretary.   Men are clearly aroused by these roles that all require being very smart.  But what they share in common is feminine demeanor.  Nurses nurture, librarians assist, secretaries are helping a superior, traditionally male in the stereotype. \n\nSo I think men are not in fact turned off by smarts.   They are turned off by aggressive competitive arguing, or intellectual pride showing off but detached from being a woman.   Would you want to be friends with anyone like that?  You might read their blog, but hang out with them?  In fact several studies say that men admire that intellectual quality from a distance, but not up close and personal. \n\nMen also don\u2019t require intelligence as a top priority the way women require in men. \n\nSo, being smart is no excuse for trouble with men. \n\nThe good news also is that if you have areas where you aren\u2019t as smart, (I know I do,) it\u2019s not a dealbreaker for most guys.   And if you\u2019re smart, you don\u2019t have to hide it, just don\u2019t make that your main personality trait; be agreeable, and don\u2019t assume your intellect is going to impress him the way respect and femininity would.  \n\n\nEdits for typos.  \n\nEdit: I fully support competition in fun things like arcades or board game dates.

That ends today, I hope.\n\n\n**Definitions and Explanations**\n\n\n *The Wall*: A metaphorical term for a physical manifestation of a woman\u2019s gradual or seemingly overnight decline from her sexual peak.\n\n [The Rational Male](https:\/\/therationalmale.com\/2012\/07\/18\/the-wall\/) defines it as \n> the threshold at which most women realize their lessened capacity to sexually compete with the next generation of women in their \u2018actualized\u2019 sexual peak (22-24).\n\n We all can agree that this is the loose definition most of us use, yes? So if you define your peak as 22-24, it makes sense that many would (wrongly) assume that 25+ is The Wall. Not so. In fact, RM goes on to describe what I believe is a much more important factor in The Wall for women and defines their fear of it: \n> However, there is a male part of the Wall equation that needs to be understood. 30 is also the general age at which men (should) become aware of their own, longer-lasting sexual market value and potential. This affects women\u2019s interpretations of the Wall. Once a Man is aware that he has the capacity to attract the sexual attentions of the younger women he\u2019d previously had limited access and understanding of, his actions and imperatives define the Wall for women who are approaching that threshold.\n\n [Notes From a Red Pill Girl](https:\/\/notesfromaredpillgirl.com\/2015\/09\/08\/the-wall-gets-us-all\/) explains it well when she says, \n> What is taboo to say in society today (but women should know) is that a woman\u2019s most valuable assets are her beauty and youth, not her education, money, or career (that would be men.) \n\n**What This Means For You**\n\n Is there a wall? Yes. Will you hit it? Yes. Should you be aware of it? Yes. Should you obsess or be afraid? *No!* \nIf you obsess about The Wall or are afraid of it, you will most likely settle down with the first chump that comes along because you\u2019re afraid you won\u2019t get anything more. Now, recently the argument was made to me that ugly girls have to settle and that marrying for love and passion is a new-fangled thing. Wonderful. Follow your own advice and enjoy your boring and stale marriage, plus the fact that you most likely will be divorced when your chump realizes there\u2019s a woman out there that will love him the way he deserves. I\u2019m aware there are ugly people. This isn\u2019t a post about that. I\u2019m talking today about The Wall. \n\n **Things that accelerate your ETA to The Wall**\n\n\n * Excessive drinking\n * Smoking of any kind \n * Being a single mother\n * Being overweight\n * Sun exposure or tanning lights\n\n\n I tell you these things not to scare you but to motivate you. Don\u2019t delay in looking for a husband. Don\u2019t settle or marry the first guy that doesn\u2019t repulse you. But look for a man while your SMV is at its peak. This varies woman to woman and your SMV, depending on what a man likes, will vary man to man. However GENERALLY you\u2019re at your highest 22-25. You have the greatest chance of attracting what you consider to be the highest value male when you are also at your highest value. Find out what makes a high value man to you, keep yourself in top condition and go after it. \n Stay fit, stay healthy, dress feminine, up your girl game, hone your skills. These are all highly controllable things we can all do (pre or post wall) to ensure we land the highest value male available to us. \n\n\n**Preparing for Impact**\n\n Save it. We all know there are exceptions. We all know women who have gotten pregnant in their 40\u2019s (Michelle Duggar, anyone?) or women who are 35 and crazy hot. These are *general* rules which is why I hate to see ladies obsess over The Wall. \n\n I want to see you ladies stop saying \u201cI\u2019m about to hit The Wall\u201d when I see from your flairs or your posts that you\u2019re 22, 25, 23, NINETEEN. You never know when or how badly you\u2019ll hit The Wall. If you\u2019ve taken care of yourself, you\u2019ll wake up one day and realize you\u2019re past your prime. If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ll most likely smash into it and you\u2019ll be the chick everyone is looking at TimeHop photos on Faceboook of and laughing about how good you looked 2 years ago compared to the train wreck of today (Tara Reid, anyone?) \n\n \n If you\u2019re married, a fantastic added benefit of your matrimony is that you will no longer fear The Wall. As *Notes From a Red Pill Girl* states,\n> Married women who are happily so will benefit from \u2018wife goggles\u2019 which is a term that means her husband\u2019s love blinds him to how his wife is aging and he still sees her as in her youth. You want those wife goggles firmly in place prior to the wall.\n \nMy MIL is 55 and my FIL is so in love with her and smitten by her he\u2019s never even aware of other women around him. She treats him like a king, and he is obsessed with her, five kids and thirty-one years later. \n\n\n**Post Wall**\n\n What if you\u2019ve hit The Wall and you\u2019re still single? There\u2019s still hope for you. You can still find a man, he just won\u2019t be as high a caliber as you could have snagged if you were 20. You aren\u2019t doomed to a life alone or a life of unattractive shlubs and bad sex. You still have worth. I think that is something a lot of women feel is that after The Wall they are worthless. Not true. There are men that don\u2019t want children or who have children from previous marriages and don\u2019t want more. Your fertility won\u2019t matter to them. Maybe it will be an older man. My dad is 59, his girlfriend is twenty years younger than him but is still over The Wall. \n\n\n The Wall is a thing and should be taken seriously but don\u2019t let it rule your life. And for God\u2019s sake, *stop saying you\u2019re about to hit The Wall*. Women my age and older, when we hear you lament about it are literally rolling our eyes and I\u2019m worried mine will fall out of my head the next time I read it. \n\n\n If my post is lacking in a specific aspect or if you have a comment or suggestion to add, please do so below. I like to have my posts be as complete as possible so people reading them are completely informed. Any and all discussions are welcome, obviously, but please lets be mindful and courteous of one another. \n\n\n All the best,\n\n ~Sadie\n\n\n Edit: 999 edits to get formatting correct","title":"The Fear of the Wall and Why I'm Sick of Hearing About It","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5qi7l6\/the_fear_of_the_wall_and_why_im_sick_of_hearing\/"}

Here it is:\n\n In our home my husband's one regular job is to take out the trash. He was getting it all ready to go and when he put a new bag in, as soon something was tossed into it, one side started sliding into the can. I didn't fix it and somehow I got it in my head to \"see if he'll fix it\". \n\n The can kept getting more and more full and internally I was shaking my head thinking, \"I can't *believe* he hasn't fixed it yet!

Why am I the only one allowed touch it? If you needed permission you could have just asked.\" (He's the king of amused mastery without knowing what it is.) \n\n That's the point! Why *didn't* I just fix it? I don't have an answer. I got it in my head that he should do it and never stopped to ask myself why. That's a shit test. Here's why: there was no right answer. If he ignored the bag or didn't notice the problem, he fails because he didn't fix the problem. If he *did* fix the bag, I wouldn't have been happy because it's something he \"should be doing anyway\".

I believed that men\u2014or at least Christian men\u2014wanted a Madonna: a woman who was virginal, demure, and \"wife material\". But I observed time and time again that this wasn\u2019t true. Being that kind of woman didn\u2019t make me more desirable; instead, it made me invisible and undateable. I learned that being demure and modest often came across as being asexual or frigid.\n\nMen would complement my modest dresses, but then turn around and date women wearing skin-tight, cheeky leggings. I even observed a religious man I respected swiping right only on scantily clad women on Tinder. Still, I convinced myself it must've been because those men just weren\u2019t \"Christian enough.\"\n\nI was still stubborn and unyielding in my approach until I finally received a wake-up call. I spoke with several women older than me\u2014some in their early thirties\u2014and realized that they acted and dressed like I did, and they still hadn\u2019t met their \"Man of God\". They were still waiting for marriage and for their \"Boaz,\" but there seemed to be no end in sight to their wait. I then reflected on the girls from my childhood church\u2014the ones I once looked down on for dressing more secular and having a constant flow of boyfriends from a young age. When I looked them up on Instagram, I noticed that those were the girls who ended up with a ring. Some were even younger than me\\[f20\\], yet they were already married and stay-at-home moms.\n\nI had misunderstood what men want. I was mistaken when I approached Girl Game as giving men a taste of the pious Wife Experience. I was even further mistaken when I thought femininity was wearing a dress and being shy. Girl Game is giving men the hot Girlfriend Experience and Femininity isn\u2019t simply wearing dresses\u2014femininity is flirty, attractive, and subtly sexual. Even devout men want a woman who is fun, flirty, and exudes unspoken allure.\n\nUltimately, I've learned that being averse to flirting and covering myself from head to toe doesn't leave any opportunity to pique a man's interest beyond friendship. Men need a reminder that you\u2019re a woman with sexual value in order to inspire romantic interest and move you out of the asexual-undateable-girl-from-church zone.","title":"I've gotten Girl Game all wrong.

You may wonder why that is. Well, here are 3 concepts\/factors that illustrate why:\n\n1) The best, most effective way for us to get commitment from men is to provoke their innate [protective instincts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/lzo0e1\/learning_about_the_male_protective_instinct_from\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that they have for things that are smaller and cuter than they are.\n\n2) The best, most effective way for us to provoke men\u2019s protective instincts (because for the high-quality men we want who have enough options, being small and cute is mandatory but not enough) is to use [submissive behavior as strategy](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/80ryqx\/submissive_behaviour_as_strategy\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).\n\n3) While submission is indeed a powerful tool in our RPW toolbox, it is important we don\u2019t use it on men who A) are so out of our leagues that no matter what we do we cannot get anything more than sex from him, B) are completely incapable of having protective instincts for women or *anyone\/anything*, C) do not inspire very much attraction\/dedication\/respect from us, and\/or D) have major red flags along the lines of violence, addiction, extreme mental health disorders, etc.\n\n\u2014\n\nSo, with all those factors in mind, here\u2019s why [**Incremental Reciprocation**](https:\/\/assets.rebelmouse.io\/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xMDU1NzY4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MjU2ODc5NH0.JrlAda1v0b4IDd-tyEXzLecTp_DILDDaZgXGVQJoSbk\/img.jpg?width=1200&height=628) is the best way to address ALL of these factors. We know how powerful submission is to inspiring his protective instincts, and therefore his commitment. But we ALSO know that **submission means vulnerability**, and while feminine vulnerability can be the catalyst of immensely fulfilling love from a benevolent protector of a man, it also could land us in a lot of trouble *if we are vulnerable to the wrong men for us*. But with Incremental Reciprocation, we get to take away A LOT of the risk factors in the early stages - while we are still vetting - AND use that Incremental Reciprocation as a *form* of vetting in and of itself.\n\nTo execute Incremental Reciprocation, you start off by doing a small\/insignificant, but nonetheless thoughtful, gesture for a man you\u2019re seeing. If he\u2019s a worthwhile partner, he will reciprocate with a similar gesture or one on a slightly bigger level as a thank you. Every time he reciprocates, so do you, on a slightly bigger scale. You incrementally increase your level of investment in him as he continues to increase his investment in you. If he stops reciprocating, you also stop doing these gestures. That way, you won\u2019t be bled dry by a parasitic partner.\n\nYou start with things that, while they definitely provoke the protective instinct in men, are relatively risk- and vulnerability-free in the grander scheme of things. For me, that meant doing small, submissive gestures that really didn\u2019t take any skin off my back. When I was a few dates in with my current SO, I did this by telling him that I wanted to cook him a big dinner with all the foods he mentioned he loved as a thank you for how well he had treated me thus far. It was something that my feminist peers gasped at (\u201cCook for him?! You barely even know him! What are you, a Stepford Wife?!\u201d), but it showed him that I was feminine, submissive, kind, thoughtful, and caring in one fell swoop. And really, all it cost me were a few hours of cooking, under $15 of groceries, and **absolutely none of my control over our very new dynamic\/relationship.**\n\nNot only was this a good way to show him that I was interested and willing to invest in him, but it also allowed me to **watch how he would react.** If he was not appreciative, and never reciprocated my investment with an investment of his own, then I would know that he wasn\u2019t into me enough to reciprocate my kindness and care. For the very low cost of 15 bucks for groceries and a couple of hours of cooking that I would have done for myself anyways, I would know that it\u2019s time to move on, with no skin off my back. But since he was floored by my small act of kindness and has treated me amazingly in return ever since, I knew that our relationship was worth my future efforts and investment. \n\nYou can **incrementally** up the ante and slowly start to do more acts of submission, each time allowing for a little more vulnerability on your part. You start to let him lead by following his plans for a date, then for a weekend getaway, then eventually for an actual trip together. You slowly start to incorporate the facets of [what makes a good First Mate](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9qknix\/the_essential_duties_of_the_first_mate\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) into your budding relationship. **Each time, you continue to check that he is responding positively with more investment on his end.** Eventually, you add so many +1s to his likelihood to commit that it\u2019s pretty darn clear this man is wholly committed and invested in you.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe trick to make Incremental Reciprocation work is understanding that **sex does not count as an Incremental Reciprocation.** At the end of the day, Incremental Reciprocation is a way to showcase your RMV, while simultaneously vetting him for his. Sex is not a thoughtful gesture of investment because it requires no actual work. We literally just have to say yes to it and succumb to our animal instincts. It does not demonstrate your kindness, thoughtfulness, nurturing spirit, or **any of the qualities that make men want to commit to you**. Because of this, it also doesn\u2019t incentivize men to reciprocate and invest back into you, because offering sex and sex alone does not sufficiently demonstrate that your RMV is far above the pack, and will not make him feel like there\u2019s any favor to return.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m telling you not to have sex at all. I\u2019m of the [somewhat controversial opinion](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/qh9xsa\/why_buy_the_cow_when_he_can_get_the_milk_for_free\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that some of us should not withhold sex until some arbitrary date as a means to secure commitment because it might not be the most optimal strategy for all of us. What I *am* saying is that **your investments always needs to be something OUTSIDE of sex**, if you want him to see you as more than a f*ckbuddy or an FWB. It should incentivize him to want to spend more nonsexual time with you, and make him want to invest in nonsexual ways in you.\n\n\u2014\n\nThat\u2019s my guide to using submission and vulnerability as a strategy to get what you want, without constantly worrying being taken advantage of or used or manipulated. By using Incremental Reciprocation as a way to inspire his commitment AND to vet for healthy and functioning partners, you minimize your risks while maximizing your reward.","title":"Incremental Reciprocation: How to Minimize Risk While Being Vulnerable and Submissive","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/sc0f8l\/incremental_reciprocation_how_to_minimize_risk\/"}

It's my lack of self-love.**\n\nEven though I want to be in a loving relationship with a high value man, and even though I know I need to be slim and look healthy in order to achieve that, on a deeper level, I don't love myself enough to feel like I deserve those things.

He keeps talking about moving to San Francisco and seems like he's serious about buying a large house there. He's bought a lot of stupid stuff\/guy toys in the past 3 weeks, and he got me a new Tesla for my birthday. \n\nLast weekend we went out for dinner with some of our mutual friends from college and I noticed that there was a really weird atmosphere of jealousy and strangeness I've never seen before. One of my friends kept subtly hitting on my boyfriend and dropping him hints. It was making me really uncomfortable and he didn't seem to care or think about how I felt. I told him afterward and he apologized and reassured me but ever since then I've had this sinking dread in my stomach.  I think he really loves me and we are very comfortable around each other, but I'm not as smart as he is and he has always needed other people to talk to about esoteric things with. I'm scared that now that he is successful he is going to dump me for some 150 IQ model from SF that makes me look like a used paper towel. I used to be higher SMV than him but I can feel how women treat him now and that I'm hated by women who think they are better than me and think \u201cWhy does this bitch deserve a good man\u201d. \n\nTo make it worse he has always disliked serious discussions about marriage and family, even though he claims that his goal in life is to have a beautiful family that he provides for. I try not to be over-jealous and controlling but it's impossible to not see every attractive woman he talks to as a potential threat to our relationship. \nI have a horrible image in my mind of me turning into a jealous bitchy wreck that eats my own best shot at a successful life from the inside out and then has to watch my SO start a family with a prettier girl while I die alone with 9 cats. My greatest fear is that I will be discarded. \n\nI'm not sure if this is the right sub for honest advice but I need to vent and organize my thoughts at least because the pressure of the situation is making me feel insane. What do I do? \n","title":"My boyfriend made it big and I'm worried I'll get dumped.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/awnpi5\/my_boyfriend_made_it_big_and_im_worried_ill_get\/"}

She seeks to be one of the guys, and is drinking and smoking weed to ridiculous amounts. She sleeps around, rejects female friendships, and calls herself a feminist because of it. She's angry and scared, fat and depressed. Her grades are pathetic and her eyeliner is constantly runny. She's a mess who refuses to change. She dates guys who are losers and disrespect her, because she thinks that's what she deserves. I wouldn't recognize that girl today. \n\nMy feminist ideals almost destroyed me. They made me blame men and desire to distance myself from \"other girls.\" They told me it was okay to be masculine and aggressive, and that my mental disorders weren't my fault and I shouldn't have to take responsibility for them. I could do whatever I want and behave however I wanted, and if anyone didn't like it they could suck my dick. (Seriously. This is a phrase I used. Major cringe.)\n\nAnd then I discovered RP. I've done a 180 and I have never been happier. I started to respect myself. I began to lose weight, wear cute, feminine clothing, and got my makeup situation on point. I stopped hating men and thinking they were monsters, and recognized masculinity as something I could appreciate without claiming it for myself. I stopped seeing other women as lesser beings or competition, and instead admired their femininity and welcomed sisterhood. I realized that I was squandering my life and began to take my studies seriously and to pursue new hobbies and interests to enrich myself. I repaired my relationships with my mother and sister. \n\nI was raised to hide my emotions and to always be emotionally strong. I struggled with the idea of true intimacy and trust. But then, I found a wonderful man. A man who respects me and the journey I have taken, and who refuses to let me sell myself short.  When he saw I was hesitant to seek treatment for my mental disorder, he accompanied me to the psychiatrist and paid for my visit and medications without a second thought. He called me out when I hid my emotions, and refused to let me shit-test him or get away with passive-aggressive behavior. He demanded that I be my best self with him. \n\nA RP relationship is just that - demanding the best from your partner, and giving them your best in return. Love is not passive. Love doesn't let you get unhealthy or unhappy, love doesn't let you morph into a harpy or a bully, love doesn't sit and watch you fail. Love is respect. Love is not tolerating your partner holding themselves to anything less than what they are. Love is a partnership, and partnerships only work if both parties are giving 100%. \n\nHe is my captain. I don't know if it's biology or what, but our dynamic works. I spent my whole life alone, hiding my emotions and hating myself. I was exhausted until he came. He is my rock - my emotions and trust are safe with him. To know that he is there, to know that I don't have to always be the strong one... I can never describe the overwhelming gratitude. And I am his first mate. He has someone who is devoted to him completely, who trusts him and is always on his side. Sometimes, I am the strong one. When he lost his home in a fire, I comforted him and let him lean on me. And sometimes, he is the cheerleader. He encourages me to pursue my degree and tells me how proud he is everyday. \n\nI know some outsiders might think so, but I don't see RP relationships as being unequal. We are all seeking stability and fulfillment, and we've found a way to have that. We've found a community that values honesty, communication, appreciation, loyalty, compassion, and balance. RPW encourage one another to be happy, to be less selfish, to be women of character and charm. We don't guilt one another or tolerate those ridiculous, catty attitudes. We're honest here, and it's so refreshing. \n\nI know I'm not the only one who has has an experience like this, and I hope this resonates with someone. I hope a young, lost girl sees this and decides to look into what TRP is about some more. So if you're a lurker out there looking to change your life, come say hello. We're happy to have you.

It is spoken by Sir Kay, who was once a great knight, now reduced to a coward. He explains why to Lancelot. \n\n>\"What happened, Kay? What happened to you? Why are you mocked? What crippled your heart and made you timid? Can you tell me - do you know?\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n \n>Kay's eyes still shone, but with tears, not pride. \"I think I know,\" he said, \"but I wonder whether you could understand it.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n>\"Tell me, my friend.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n>\"Granite so hard that it will smash a hammer can be worn away by little grains of moving sand. And a heart that will not break under the great blows of fate can be eroded by the nibbling of numbers, the creeping of days, the numbing treachery of bitterness, of important littleness. I could fight men but I was defeated by marching numbers on a page. Think of fourteen xiii's -- a little dragon with a stinging tail -- or one hundred and eight cviii's -- a tiny battering ram. If only I had never been seneschal! To you a feast is festive -- to me it is a book of biting ants. So many sheep, so much bread, so many skins of wine, and has the salt been forgotten? Where is the unicorn's horn to test the king's wine? Two swans are missing. Who stole them? To you war is fighting. To me it is so many ashen poles for spears, so many strips of steel -- counting of tents, of knives, of leather straps -- counting -- counting of pieces of bread. They say the pagan has invented a number which is nothing -- nought -- written like an O, a hole, an oblivion. I could clutch that nothing to my breast. Look, sir, did you ever know a man of numbers who did not become small and mean and frightened -- all greatness eaten away by little numbers as marching ants nibble a dragon and leave picked bones? Men can be great and fallible -- but numbers never fail. I suppose it is their terrible puny rightness, their infallible smug, nasty rightness that destroys -- mocking, nibbling, gnawing with tiny teeth until there's no man left in a man but only a pie of minced terrors, chopped very fine and spiced with nausea. The mortal wound of a numbers man is a bellyache without honor.\" \n\nThere you have it, that is How you Bring Down A Hero. You take him away from his calling and you force him into something important and necessary yet deadening. Kay used to thrive on fighting and swordsmanship and riding and hunting - but now he is a numbers man. \n\nIf your Hero is a mathematician - force him to teach schoolchildren. An athlete? Give him a desk job. An engineer - why it couldn't be easier, promote him to management! A farmer? Public service. If he wants to fly to the moon, get him to dig for oil underneath the ground. \n\nAnd if he ever complains or holds out hope for his true calling - tell him - \"That will never do! How will we afford the house? How will we pay for the children's school! You must dig for oil underneath the ground, there is no other way! I have expensive tastes you know - and saving up for years will never work. We'll have holidays to take and a mortgage to pay. Any savings will be used for everything else!\" \n\nOnce you've done that, you've already Brought him Down to Sir Kay's position. He should be demoralised. You can make it even worse.\u00a0Even Sir Kay, though he was reduced to meekness, still persevered because he had purpose. When Lancelot said:\n\n>\"Then burn your books, man! Rip your accounts and let them take the wind from the highest tower. Nothing can justify the destruction of a man.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n>\"Eh! Then there would be no feast; in war no spears or food to make the battle possible.\"\n\nAnd Sir Kay slept gladly at night, because he was still needed to keep the feasts going, the spears ready and the battles fought.\n\nLet's say your man, like Kay, settles into his new groove. The work, while completely ill-suited to him, he unexpectedly excels at, and performs capably, and begins to feel a little proud of. Even if he is not living the dream - at least he's good at supply chain management, and mining is an important industry! Hundreds of people depend on him, more if you think about the downstream uses! He begins to feel necessary and irreplaceable. It would take them half a year to train a replacement - and everyone looks up to him and respects him because he is great at his job. \n\nThis will not do; let's figure out How To Bring Him Down even further. If he ever complains about hardship at work, repeat it back to him. Start pointing out how stressful his job is, how bad the hours are. His boss is a jerk. He could get paid more somewhere else if he quit.\u00a0 \n\nWomen and men differ in that a job is not just an income for men. **Men derive their worth from their actions and work. Women derive their worth from who they are \u00a0loved and cherished by**.\n\nSo, to make him feel worthless, all you have to do is demean their work. \"What is that job good for anyway? Don't you know the mining industry is evil? You're not helping anyone! Go into another industry, something better for the environment. Your boss can deal with it himself, imagine if it all fails without you! Ha! Serves them right!\"\n\nIf he balks and refuses and holds onto his manly pride as a provider of the family, you can deliver the crushing blow. \n\n\"Don't worry honey, we don't need your income anyway. Take a few months off, we have plenty of savings and I will still bring in an income.\"\u00a0 \n\nThis will surely Bring Him Down! After suppressing his nature, and dismissing whatever status he has earnt, you now strike his own sense of importance as the man of the family. If he can so simply quit, it means the family *doesn't need him.* He will feel utterly useless to the people he loves the most. He would rather be worked to death and appreciated by his loved ones than relaxing, unappreciated, unneeded. **Men need to be needed**. Without that, they lose purpose.\n\nAs for How To Bring Down A Heroine, Bring Down Her Hero.\u00a0","title":"How To Bring Down A Hero","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pkl7hr\/how_to_bring_down_a_hero\/"}

I did the julia childs green beans like someone suggested (delicious and the only way I will make them from now on!), blanched early on in the day and sauteed with butter lemon juice and salt 10 minutes before serving, had three crock pots of chuck roast going all day and took out the bones and fat around two hours before serving to consolidate and shred the meat into one crock pot on low, made the rice casserole the day before and had it warming in a 250 oven for 45 minutes before serving, cubed 10 pounds of potatoes the night before, and boiled them 30 minutes before serving, drained, and seasoned with fresh rosemary and thyme simmering in a cup of butter, salt, and a splash of cream a few minutes before serving, had prepped the romaine earlier and tossed the salad a few minutes before serving (6 heads of romaine and an entire jar of caesar and fresh parm) and made my great grandmother's rolls from scratch the day before (48!).

Dating is a game where men want to get sex from a woman and women want to get commitment from a man. The higher quality the target, the better the rewards.  Being consciously aware of alpha and beta tells can give you a big leg up in vetting men.\n\nDifferent women don't necessarily want the same exact things out of a man in the long run, but there are some common things that virtually all women either do want or should want from a man for the sake of maximizing the chances of a happy, successful, long-term relationship. One framework for thinking about all of this is looking at a combination of how alpha and how beta he is in general. Being just a little conscious of what you're looking at with these characteristics can really simplify a lot of the confusion that some people have with the vetting process.\n\n**Red Flags and Green Flags**\n\nThese can fall into Alpha (attraction, masculinity, dominating his environment, etc.) and Beta (comfort, financial stability, importance of family, commitment) categories. I want to point out that one red flag doesn't necessarily mean that a man is a bad choice, and one green flag doesn't necessarily mean he's a great choice. However, if you're stacking up a few red flags, you'd better have some pretty incredible green flags to go with it if you want a chance at a long-term, successful and happy relationship with the guy.\n\n\n**Alpha Red Flags:**\n\n* Regularly flirts with other women in front of you\n* Makes it clear that he doesn't care about your needs or feelings\n* Uses fear\/intimidation\/anger or other negative actions to get his way\n* Cavalier attitude about long-term consequences and externalized costs\n* Lack of stable long-term relationships in his life; all the people in his past are considered *assholes*\n* Expresses \"Dark triad\" traits that amount to Narcissistic, Antisocial, or Borderline Personality Disorder manifestations\n\n**Alpha Green Flags:**\n\n* Takes care of his appearance and looks attractive and presentable\n* Organically *draws* flirting from other women, but responds in a way that saves face for them *and* you\n* Has his \"own life\" with hobbies, things he does for himself, etc\n* Uses positive reinforcement and charisma to get his way; people *want* to follow his lead\n* Picks battles well; respectful toward legitimate authority figures  (Has anyone *ever* AMOG'd their way out of a speeding ticket?)\n\n**Beta Red Flags:**\n\n* Acts needy\n* Bad hygiene\n* Poor diet, lack of exercise\n* Won't lead- in your relationship or anywhere else\n* Lacks drive, passion, and purpose in life: dead-end job, lack of stimulating hobbies and interests\n\n**Beta Green Flags:**\n\n* Financially secure and responsible\n* Future-oriented, has long-term plans and goals in place\n* Treats people well in general (without overdoing it to the point of supplication)\n* *Reasonably* responsive to your needs and the problems you bring to him\n* Healthy, stable relationships in his life: family, friends, colleagues\n\n**The Alpha\/Beta Mix**\n\nThe ideal mate for a RPW is going to be a guy who has a relatively balanced mix of alpha and beta. If he's got too much alpha and not enough beta, that means he's just going to want to hit it and send you on your way. If he's got too much beta and not enough alpha, then he's going to be so unattractive that it's going to feel like someone just dropped a dog turd in your lap when he tries to hold your hand. What this basically means is that you need to make sure you're dealing with a guy who has green flags for both alpha and beta, and not just a lack of red flags.\n\nMany RP women describe their excellent spouses\/LTRs as \"Soft Alpha\" or \"Greater Beta.\"  These gray area classifications show one of the limitations of the somewhat simplistic Greek Lettering System for Men.^^TM  The takeaway point is, Red Pill Women have reported over and over that a healthy blend of leadership and provisioning traits is a proven formula for a good life partner.\n\n# Vetting a new partner is the most important point of control in a woman's love life.  Use your advantage in the sexual marketplace to carefully CHOOSE from among your suitors the best man possible for you individually, by using a well-thought-out vetting plan.\n\n____\n\n**About the author** \/u\/RedPillWomen *is a composite user ID for posting the collaborative works of the RedPillWomen Mod and Writing Team.*\n\n*This article was written by u\/VigilantRedRooster; the section on Alpha\/Beta traits builds upon [this framework](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4r7s7r\/a_red_pill_framework_for_rpw_vetting_men\/) by u\/RedPillNobody.

Although I figured out early on that he liked me, neither of us could really act on it because we were living in different states, and have been dating since mid-August when I moved. We went to NYC because he was running in the marathon and had been training for a massive PR, and I came along as his cheerleader. I can't tell you what his time or time goals were, as I don't want to dox him, but I can tell you that both his previous PR and the PR he achieved in NYC were very fast times (e.g. within the top 1% of runners in the race).\n\nHere's what I focused on doing throughout the trip not just to stand behind him as he tried to achieve this athletic goal, but also to make the trip a positive, romantic bonding experience for the both of us.\n\n* **STFU and let him talk** **(especially about running\/the race)**: We're both runners, so this has always been easy for me. I've learned early on in our relationship (back when we were just friends even) that when he's feeling nervous about a race  or concerned about an injury\/possible athletic issue, it doesn't really show in his mannerisms or his tone of voice. He can talk about an injury, a possible stumbling block, etc., completely calmly, and over time I realized that he did it because he trusted me. So I made it my goal to be a safe place to land by **getting good at listening to him and validating him\/actually following what he says.**\n* **Be physically affectionate....like, more than you think you should:** Obviously I didn't do anything he wasn't comfortable with. We've been pretty conservative sexually (i.e. nothing past cuddling or kissing, we haven't even had a hot makeout session yet), so I had to work within some unspoken boundaries. I basically took the affection displayed when we've gone out in the past and cranked it up a notch: more random hugs, more random kisses on the cheek\/neck\/forehead\/hairline\/lips, more random caresses, standing\/sitting close on the subway, etc. And I of course cranked it up to eleven after he finished his race, both when we met up after and throughout the remainder of that day. To me, he was a freaking superhero Viking man , and I literally could not have kept my hands off of him if my life depended on it. Us ladies have a lot more leeway than guys do when it comes to physical touch, so I took advantage of it.(Note: If we were further along physically, I definitely would have given him an enthusiastic blowjob (or two) after the race when we were back at the Airbnb and going to bed, just letting him lie back and experience some lovely pleasure. And I'd be lying if I said that didn't cross my mind. We definitely need to have a more explicit conversation about our respective sexual boundaries\/expectations soon, make no mistake).\n* **Let him navigate\/take the lead on plans:** With one exception, I let him lead the entire trip. There were times where he asked me what I wanted to do that day -- instead of giving him a laundry list of places and times, I suggested a few places and asked where we should go when. If we were walking around outside, and he wanted to go into a shop to look at running shoes or buy a coffee or look at vitamins (we're both very health conscious), I followed him in. He even insisted on asking his cousins again if I could stay with him at their apartment on our final night in New York instead of me staying with a friend of mine in the city like we had originally planned, and I didn't try to stop him. The only exception was when we had to get to the airport for our flight back: He wanted to take the subway, which would have gotten us to the airport 40min before our flight was supposed to take off. I pushed back, called an Uber, and got us there 60min before our flight was supposed to take off. Turns out, the TSA lines were so busy that we would have missed our flight if I hadn't taken over. My Captain is much less experienced with flying and didn't realize we needed more time, so he didn't know.\n* **Expressing yourself**: If I saw something beautiful\/cool\/cute\/funny, I said so. Looking back, I was almost childlike in how I explored New York and looked at all that was around me. I already have this mindset because that's just how I am anyway, so it was just cranked up to 11 in New York.\n* **Anticipate his needs**: This was mainly for race day, but I made sure to plan ahead so that all he had to worry about was running the race, not how I was doing. We picked out a couple of locations where he would see me along the course, and I made sure to get there and embarrass myself by cheering extra loud for him when I saw him. I texted some of his family members beginning at 5am that morning when we were headed to Staten Island for the start, letting them know how he was doing. This way, instead of him remembering to call them after the race to say what his time was, he was fielding calls from his mom\/dad\/brother telling him how great he did. I had wet wipes ready for him at the finish so he could wipe the dried sweat from his face, as well as plenty of water and a bagel with tofutti cream cheese so he could hydrate\/eat something. I also did little things that I always do on our dates like refilling his water glass at dinner when it's nearly empty and making sure he doesn't have to wait ages for me to get ready (e.g. by doing my makeup while he's in the shower).\n* **Giving him space**: The day before the race, he wanted to go to our Airbnb and take a nap\/relax. I still wanted to explore, so we separated while I did some more exploring. Just because you're traveling together does not mean you can't take a few hours to go your separate ways and take in the new place on your own.\n\n**THE RESULTS:**\n\n* **He also could not keep his hands off me.** My Captain has been less forward than me with his physical affection, but he's figured out over time that I'm a touchy lady. This vacation was the first time that he gave me spontaneous kisses, even in public\/on our plane. We were also holding hands as we walked everywhere, which has not happened before. He got even bolder and cuter\/goofier after a couple of cocktails one night when we were playing shuffleboard, and there was even MORE kissing. I also learned when we shared a pullout couch at his cousins that I love morning breath kisses and sleepy cuddles (we had separate beds at the Airbnb).\n* **He's definitely turned up the romance.** He gave me a napkin from this tea place that says \"I love you so matcha!\" which I am not taking as an \"I love you\" declaration but rather a romantic bit of cute. He knows I love the city lights at night, so he took me to a Brooklyn pier, Central Park, and the High Line on multiple nights so we could walk around and enjoy the beauty of the lights. During those walks, he sat us down in a couple private spots and initiated a little spontaneous kissing.\n* **He (seriously) said we would go to Tokyo together in five years**. He's joked a few times about us getting married early on, mainly because when I first met a few of his running\/biking friends, they asked if we were engaged or married -- presumably because we're both Christians. Anyway, we went into this Japanese kawaii beauty store just for random fun, and he said it reminded him of what he thought Tokyo would be like and how he'll go there in probably about five years for the Tokyo Marathon. I (jokingly) said I would be his cheerleader there too if he hadn't murdered me in five years -- I've got a dark sense of humor, and we joked before the trip about us hopefully not killing each other while traveling together. He came up behind me, put his arm around my waist, said, \"What are you talking about? Of course we'll go together -- nobody's going to be murdering anybody in five years,\" and then gave me a kiss.\n* **He's bragged about how supportive I've been and how much it means to have me as his \"number one.\"** I've lost count of how many people he's bragged about me too, be it strangers, fellow marathoners we struck up conversations with later on in the city, or even his parents. It really made my heart melt just how much my coming along and taking care of him meant to him. I'm sure his dad wasn't particularly surprised, considering he knows me very well already, but him expressing this really meant the world to me.\n* **While we were still on the trip, he invited me to his friend's wedding and Thanksgiving\/Thanksgiving weekend at his place.** Actually, I think it's more his dad's friend than his, since his dad was invited to perform the ceremony. I don't know how big a deal it is for a new boyfriend to invite you to a wedding as his date, particularly if he knows some of the people there already, but these are definitely positive developments! Thanksgiving day is not definitive, as he and his dad may be traveling, but the weekend sure is. (Edited 11\/18: Thanksgiving is a go!)\n\nOverall, this trip went well!","title":"New relationship: Our first vacation together","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/dt4xjw\/new_relationship_our_first_vacation_together\/"}

But the major qualification to do intervention in a profoundly unhealthy relationship is *physical presence and ongoing involvement*... neither of which we are able to provide you. \n\n**This isn't the \"when you should leave\" list. It's the \"we can't help you\" list**. You might leave even a serious relationship for many more reasons than this. But these are specifically things where internet advice is inappropriate. \n\nHere are some situations which might be severe enough that you should seek in-person help, or consider ending the relationship, even if it is an ongoing long-term one with a lot invested in it: \n\n.1. *Physical abuse*. \n\nWhile the stereotype of unilateral evil-man-beats-innocent-angelic-woman is not the typical abuse situation, *any* type of relationship violence is a severe problem, whether it's him striking you, you striking him, both of hitting each each other, or anyone hitting the kids. This level of relationship conflict is not something we can defuse with internet advice. You should seek expert help, and consider ending the relationship if that does not work... patterns of this level of conflict can be difficult to break.  Seek help in person. \n\n(Note: this doesn't apply to kinky sex. If one of you is hitting the other, not out of anger, but because you both get off on it, that might be considered \"violence\", but it isn't *conflict*. Just be careful not to get too enthusiastic and put someone in the Emergency Room.)\n\n.2. *Severe emotional abuse or conflict*\n\nThe real damage in abusive relationships often results from living in fear or a constant state of vigilance, rather than simply injuries. This same effect can be created with words. Like physical violence, this can go either way, or in both directions at once, but is not something anyone can simply \"live with\"... it can cause severe mental and even physical health problems.  Seek help in person. \n\n.3. *Severe addiction*\n\nWhile our culture is slowing coming around to the idea that addiction is a health problem, rather than a moral or criminal one, addict behaviour can be very destructive, and the consequences of living close to an addict can be severe. While the choice to stay or leave is ultimately an individual one, we can't provide advice for that choice here, because it's simply too hard to get insight into the situation over the internet. Seek help in person. \n\n.4. *Prolonged physical separation* \n\nWhile this one may seem harsh, as it isn't really anyone's \"fault\", relationships *are* close personal contact, and prolonged separation is not something they can necessarily survive. The decision to end a relationship because someone cannot be available enough to make it work is a painful one, but sometimes it is necessary to do so, so that both people can be free to find another that *can* fulfilled their needs. Discuss this with your partner, and seek advice from friends and family who have known you a long time. \n\n(*When this is initially posted, I will leave the comments open so that readers can suggest amendments. The intent here is to have a permanent list of \"this problem is beyond the scope of RPW situations\" that we can link people to, instead of randomly saying \"leave him, gurl, You Deserve Better^(TM)!\"*)","title":"Problems that are beyond the scope of RPW.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ktbi3l\/problems_that_are_beyond_the_scope_of_rpw\/"}

I felt like when my dad was the breadwinner, and she wasn\u2019t so focused on her career she was much more present and nurturing in my life. However when she switched roles with my dad, she became much more absent.\n\nUnrelated to her role as breadwinner.....She would be so nice to me and in seconds snap at me or a family member over something so trivial.

This made me feel very violated and unprotected in my household. \n\nWith her being more aggressive, unreliable, absent, and unpredictable, I think I have subconsciously internalized that all women are like her. I think the my mommy issues that have revealed in me are: \n\n- I have a hard time making female friends, and tend to connect better with men. \n\n- I generally distrust women. \n\n- I grew up very tomboy and felt very \nuncomfortable being feminine (May or may not be related). \n\nI want to work on these and be a much better woman and mom.

Blue Pill wants to answer this one. \n\n **Blue pill:** *We are complex individuals, each of us is unique, everybody likes something else, nothing is simple and we re nothing alike.*\n\nThere I was, out of college, understanding absolutely nothing about what was around me.

I was confused and scared. \n\n\nTRP lays us some universal rules by which us, as humans, think and behave. \n\nTRP says we're not that damn special. We're mammals, we have instincts, we have needs. We're weak, but by accepting weakness we can build strength. **Redpill is all about the factual, observable reality.**\n\nPost-TRP I understood my place as a woman in society, what I am  valued on, I understood why I was attracted to \"douchebags\" and not \"nice guys\". I understood why girls I considered \"stupid and boring\" (I was jealous of them) were getting guys that would not look at me twice. \n\nI made sense of things in retrospective. Look back on your teen\/young adult years through Red Pill lens, isn't it all just so simple? \n\n-----\n\n\n **Reduced social anxiety**\n-----\n\n\nMaybe this deserve its own post but I will say this: I dropped out of college because I could not handle social anxiety. \n**Since I started reading TRP I have no social anxiety anymore & here's how it worked for me:**\n\nI was hyperventilating reading on TRP  how men rate women on scales from 1-10.

I was disappointed. \n\nTo me personality was the most important thing men valued in girls. *\"C'mon, there must be some mentions about strong women around here!\"*\n\n\n**Mindblown.**\n\n\nI realized the lies. I realized that my social anxiety didn't matter. Its source was my inability to meet imaginary expectations in terms of \"my personality.\" I was stressing that I was boring and that I was stupid. \n\n*Should I be witty? What should I say?*\n\n*I don't want to seem dumb, nobody likes a dumb girl. Oh, I must seem fun and bubbly!*\n\nI realize no matter how stupid I am or how boring I am, it just doesn't matter. My role as a woman is not to lead the conversation and be the witty entertainer. If you have social anxiety focus on looking good and polished and getting rid of bitch face (if you posses it). Now relax. Nobody is going to judge you, disqualify you or criticize you based on anything else. \n\n**The lesser you speak the better, it makes your word valuable.**\n\nDon't ramble like anxious people do.

They are angry, they post passive-aggressive quotes and surf the web for articles to be offended by. \n\nSounds exhausting to me. \n\nA RPWoman knows for example that \"f*ckboys\" just follow their interest. Why be angry at biological instincts of mating with as many women as possible?  Why be angry men are attracted to youth? If they weren't, they would have mated with old infertile women. \n\n**In this subreddit are in a much better place mentally then our blue pill counterparts.** Ever since I understood the rules of nature I cannot be angered by petty things and so should every RPWoman. \n\n-----\n\n **The ability to make choices wisely**\n-----\nIf somebody asked my N-count before TRP I would have lied about it saying at least 5. It's...way lower. I didn't want to seem like a loser. \n\nYes, I was that programmed. I was that beta that I believed a low N-count is detrimental to my value so **I was willing to say that I slept with at least 5 men, even though I did not.**\n\nI'm sure even some BP women know that a high N-count is unattractive but I didn't. This is called \"projection mentality\". Because a man who sleeps around increases his value, I believed this applies to me also.  Now you can see how easy you can make a bad choice while under blue pill spell. Imagine what kind of choices that mindset would make me do. \n\nLuckily I took TRP in time and I maintained my integrity.\n\nBlue Pill screws up your choices, your ability to discern things correctly and gives you a set of values that are not real in application. Riding the CC is one of blue pill's main attractions and we know how that turns out. \n\nIn a climate of confusion\/ambiguity anything goes, there's no right & wrong (because everybody's different, right?).\n\n **On the pill the lines are clear and the hamster is silent** - this always leads to better choices.  \n\n\n-----\n\n**TLDR;** There is so much more to RP than a sexual strategy. Read what I wrote in bold. We're lucky we're out of the matrix. ","title":"Red Pill is power.

I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of posts lately from ladies struggling with their view of men, RP theory, and individual men in their lives. It got me thinking of all the ways I\u2019m grateful for my man, and men in general. \n\nNote: This is my first time posting from this account (made a new one for pregnancy-related stuff)\n\nHere\u2019s just a few of the many things I appreciate about my man:\n\n- He is a natural problem-solver\n\n- He is an *incredible* listener and always encourages me to come to him if something\u2019s not right\n\n- The way he grabs me and pulls me in for a passionate kiss while I\u2019m cooking for him makes me absolutely melt, oh my goodness\n\n- He is a fantastic provider and always makes sure my needs are met. Before this relationship, I always put my needs last in order to take care of others. He doesn\u2019t let me do that anymore!\n\n- He has a strong moral character and his countenance is steady. I can rely on him to lead and provide stability.\n\n- Family is very important to him, and he\u2019s very traditionally minded. We\u2019re expecting our first child in December and he\u2019s been so excited from the start!\n\n- I have full faith and confidence that he\u2019ll make an excellent head of household. He\u2019s the first man I can truly envision growing old with, surrounded by a gaggle of grandchildren.\n\nThere\u2019s honestly so much more - I could go on for hours about how lucky I am to be with him. RP really does work, and I\u2019m so grateful for the guidance and support of this community. For reference - I\u2019m 31 and he\u2019s 29, so not the \u201cstandard\u201d age pairing you\u2019d expect. \n\nFor those ladies that are struggling - don\u2019t give up! Keep focusing and working on yourself. There are plenty of good, strong, loyal men out there.\n\nAnd to the traditional men - thank you for staying steady in a misguided modern culture.","title":"Men: An Appreciation Post","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/13muf4u\/men_an_appreciation_post\/"}

Some whinyness, prone to silence and being cold when I'm upset. And that's gross. My bf is so very patient and sweet. Literally the personality of a golden retriever. Just sweetness wrapped up in beauty. \n\nSo he's training for work and asked me to come see him for a 3 day weekend. His family was also visiting him so we were sharing him over the 3 days for the most part. And honestly, the trip wasnt perfect but *he* was perfect and I think I'm finally making that distinction. So I wanted to tell you guys how I altered my behavior for certain situations.\n\n1- I invited him to take a walk with me while we were at his family's party. He's a relatively quiet dude and I think I would typically just have stayed yapping with his family, which of course is fine but I wanted to focus on *him* more. So I politely asked if he'd like to take a walk with me and he looked surprised and said of course. We went on our walk holding hands the whole time while he showed me things in the neighborhood. I got emotional at a certain point because I missed him so much so typically I wouldve caved in inwards with silence but i forced it out and cried to him. That I missed him so much and  I just loved him so much. And let me tell you, he held me like I was made of glass and honestly I felt like I was. Then I made us stop to look at a bunny in a bush and a cool beetle on the ground. He just stood there smiling at me while I crouched and tried to communicate with the bunny. \ud83d\ude02 That was an exercise in childlikeness! We stayed out on our walk until his parents called him because they were getting ready for bed at midnight.\n\n\n2- He was supposed to come to my hotel at a certain time but was late from dropping his family off at the airport and traffic. I had already felt an attitude bubbling because I have had issues with patience. My texts were a little short and he asked me if something was wrong. I redirected my energy and said no and asked him how he was doing instead of voicing my frustration. I let him tell me he was upset because he just wanted to see me. I was still a bit frustrated but once he got to me I held him and told him to get in the bed. Then I redirected that frustration in a way that made us both happy \ud83d\ude02 I can't get mad at him being late because he was fulfilling his obligations to his parents! Airports are just finnicky! We cuddled afterwards and he told me nothing feels better than laying in bed with me.\n\n3- he told me he had a blister on his foot and I think before I would've just been like well you need better shoes. But I told him to let me see his feet and I held them and actually drained it!! Gross. But he was thanking me and giving me forehead kisses so I didn't mind. I'm happy I could alleviate his pain with action instead of telling him something he knows. Duh, you know you need better shoes if these give you blisters.\n\n4- He had taken me and his family out to dinner and the cuisine basically included shrimps with head on. After he got rid of my shrimps heads for me he started teasing me with the severed head (I know \ud83d\ude02)  but I just giggled and acted scared because I kinda was but not like a horrified scream and yelling, like a shocked \"baby, why?!\" Kinda situation. His family laughed and teased us. It was immature but like, why not? Why can't a man tease his woman for 30 seconds? Fun is fun is fun. I'm glad we're still lighthearted and if a shrimp head keeps us playful I can deal with that!\n\n\nSo that was my trip and the ways I've tried to become a better woman for him. I'm trying to put my emotions out more because I have a habit of keeping it in and shutting down. He loves when I laugh until I snort and I think it's wrong of me to not try my hardest to make sure he gets snorts often lol. I'm happy I'm finally finding a way to deliver even negative emotions in a sweet way. In a way that makes him want to keep me safe and happy and precious!","title":"Just wanted to share some happy developments from a crabby gf!!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/c7otw1\/just_wanted_to_share_some_happy_developments_from\/"}

The advice I've gotten from here is beyond valuable though, I genuinely feel happier in my life and my relationship and I credit it to RPW. Cultivating a feminine frame a mind has made my man more rabid for me than ever. I was always sort of confused about how RPW establish a C\/FM dynamic but once I started implementing the advice here, it established itself quite quickly. I realized that for the length of my relationship I'd been pushy, bitchy, and annoying and that the reason we were fighting so much was because of ME and my entitled mentality. \n\nQuick background on my guy. He's 3.5 yrs older than me, I'm 25, he recently got out of the military after serving for ten years. He's very much a good man, a natural leader, strong, tall, intelligent, pretty much alpha. which I love. But I honestly was at first kind of intimidated by, because it went against all the leftist indoctrination I'd be force fed from university, culture, etc. \n\nAbout four months ago I found RPW and made changes immediately. Some of the first things I did after reading RPW:\n\n* Started going to sleep one hour earlier to ensure I could get 8 hours of sleep. \n\n* Waking up early enough to where I could make myself look good(and by extension feel good!) and start making breakfast for my man and I \n\n* Instead of telling my guy what I want to do, I started asking him \"I really want to know what you want, love, what do *you* want to do?\" This was from advice I found here, because I had been pushy it seemed he started second guessing his instincts to lead...\n\n* No nagging, at all, ESPECIALLY before he goes to work, no fighting about the unimportant stuff with the idea that as I fix these behaviors the bigger issues will work themselves out\n\n* Made sure that before my SO gets home I've made our bed, had dinner ready, and the house was cleaned, just so that when we're together *we can relax* and that this would also stop the bigger fights from bubbling up. \n\n* In an effort to save money, I began packing all of our lunches, and writing little love notes with super girly bubbly writing just so my guy will feel loved \n\n**The results**\n\nGetting 8 hours of sleep has made me sexier. It's not in my head, I took pictures of before\/after, I noticed that my skin has more radiance, it has a youthful glow and flush to it, and my laugh lines are almost invisible, late nights and little sleep really DOES take it's toll. It's also made me incredibly more relaxed throughout that day, and I feel like it just helped me be more stable between emotional peaks. \n\nWhen I started making breakfast for my guy he was a little confused, mostly because he was used to waking up by himself and eating cereal, but he's come to love me waking up with him. I notice that he's so much happier when he goes off to work because of *this little change* and that he can't help but tackle me when he gets home. It's taken stress off of both of us. It lets him sort of relax and wake up in the morning time while I fix us something to eat, he even will do sweet little things like embracing me while I'm working, or making us tea. \n\nWith packing his lunches, it was something I could do in between fixing breakfast, and after cleaning up dinner the night before. I've been writing him small notes and packing homemade baked goods for him in his lunch, for the first month or so it was pretty normal, it didn't seem to make a huge difference, but months after the fact he proudly will come home now and talk about how his co-workers make comments about how he should \"marry that girl\", and that his friends at his office are envious that he has great food to eat. Sometimes I'll pack him extra stuff and he gives that to the people around him and they rave on my baking ability! This has had such a huge effect on our relationship that I can't believe I never did it, he seems really proud to be with me, if that makes any sense. The added bonus to this is the money we've saved... Ladies, we've saved SO MUCH by doing this, that this has greatly reduced random financial stress as well. Lately I've noticed that he will randomly buy me little gifts and he isn't worried about money so much anymore. \n\nWhen I say no nagging, I mean that I never ask him to help me clean up after he's worked all day, or I know he needs to relax. I notice instead that after a particularly great day, he'll just start helping me clean up after dinner unprovoked, I praise him and love him for this and as a result we are both happy. I've also made sure not to tout my efforts as something he should be grateful for, for example I don't say things like, \"I worked so hard today to make this food; You're so lucky you have me, most guys would want a woman that takes care of them like this\", I've seen women do this to their men before, and no one seems happy. I've noticed that *I don't need to anyway*, because it wasn't long before he will do it for me, he'll compliment my efforts and I just smile and kiss him and cuddle him and it makes us both happy.\n\nBy asking my man what *he* wants really helped establish the C\/FM dynamic that I don't know how I ever lived without. I got this little piece of advice from here in a thread one day and started using it the day I found it. After a few weeks he began to just say what we were doing, and I would just go with it. I've noticed that when doing projects together, like assembling IKEA furniture, I just default to his ideas, and let him go. For some reason I never did this before, I guess because I didn't trust him? \nBut I've discovered that by trusting him we are better off than ever. He seems to have SO MUCH more confidence and the ideas he comes up with and decisions he makes are really good *for us*, he seems accomplished and happy doing this, it's natural for him. Where before I was reluctant to give up that control of a situation he would second guess himself and then projects would turn into fights, by letting him make the calls he now will ASK me if he is unsure and request a suggestion, it's improved everything!!!! No more stupid fights about these things! Another thing is when giving my captain(I can call him that now!) a suggestion, it's always a suggestion, I'm sure to never tell him what to do, or undercut his decisions, but instead just contribute to them, and now we work completely together, it's for the best. \n\nSex. All of these little things have added up to one huge critical factor. My man is hungry for me. I feel desired like I never have before, it honestly feels like that since taking care of these things, it's cleared up so much free time for him to not worry about these silly household things and now that intensity has been directed at me... in a good way ;) I'm terrible at talking about sex, but basically, ohhh myyy goddd. Good stuff. :)\n\n---\n\nThis is literally the longest post I've ever written, but I HOPE that maybe some other lurker out there will see this, I WANT the ladies here to critique me and give me more advice or tell me what I can to do ever better, and I have to say THANK YOU, RPW... Thank you. \n\nI know that this man is the one who I want to spend the rest of my life with and the other day I glanced at him on his computer and noticed he had a tab on his computer that was titled \"wedding proposals\", if he proposes to me I will be the happiest lady ever. A month ago he randomly asked me about ring sizes... so. I need to stop rambling but yeah, it seems like the RPW philosophy *does work* because I'm happy, he's happy, and I'm finally getting the commitment and fulfilling relationship I've always wanted. \n\nbest to all\u2764\ufe0e","title":"Hi RPW, long time lurker, first time poster(long), field report about the effects of my behavior changes since finding the RPW.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2mba73\/hi_rpw_long_time_lurker_first_time_posterlong\/"}

I felt like women could be doing something different in these scenarios. I felt like this was a communication issue. I felt like it was all off, but I didn\u2019t know what or how.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen \u201cYou should\u2019ve asked!\u201d then here is a little run-through. It opens with a woman preparing a meal and trying to take care of her children at the same time, resulting in a kitchen disaster and a fight between husband and wife where the husband says \u201cYou should have asked for help!\u201d\n\nThe narrator brings up this concept of \u201cThe Mental Load\u201d - which, in short, is the belief that women are the \u201chouse managers\u201d and are expected to be in charge of the home, even in the modern age of women taking on careers. The mental load is having to remember laundry, dishes, appointments, cleaning, and what-have-you. The comic proceeds to say this isn\u2019t fair, and men aren\u2019t helpful enough around the home, and when women ask them to do things for them around the house, men either don\u2019t do enough or they do it wrong.\n\nSome of the scenes include a woman upset that her husband didn\u2019t do the dishes and he responding with \u201cWell you never asked!\u201d Another is three women complaining about things their husbands didn\u2019t do right. The next is explaining why it can take 2 hours to clean a coffee table because cleaning the coffee table entails so much more than just the coffee table, and if she asked him to clean the coffee table, that's all he'd do, and it would be messy again in a couple hours. After that, an example of asking her husband to get a baby bottle out of the dishwasher, and being frustrated that he didn\u2019t empty the dishwasher.\n\nTake the coffee table example from the comic. She is distressed, and he notices, and instead of explaining her problem, she asks him to do one thing on a list of 20, so of course, her husband sees she\u2019s distressed and believes that all he needs to do is clear the coffee table and all will be fine. She tells him to get the bottle out of the dishwasher, so he gets the bottle out of the dishwasher, because she didn\u2019t tell him about the dishes or anything else she needed help with.\n\n**The comic fails at its core because it places the woman as the head of the household, declares her as the expert, and outlines her failures with communicating to her partner about her needs as if it is HIS problem. In other words, she's setting him up to fail and getting mad about it.**\n\nAs a baseline, the entire concept is somewhat demeaning and insinuates men are so helpless when it comes to household economics that they are unable to think or do things around the home for themselves, and they only will do things around the house if they are instructed to. If that were true, no man ever in the history of society would ever be capable of living alone, or amongst other men. Another big fat red flag about this complaint is that the women in the comic expect their significant others to be able to read their minds, and then get upset when he doesn\u2019t do what she didn\u2019t tell him to do.\n\nOkay, Stripe, so it\u2019s demeaning to men. These women just picked bad men. Get over it. *Right?*\n\n*Wrong!*\n\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, I toiled over this idea for a few weeks after the first time I saw this comic pop up on my social media feed. It didn\u2019t hit me until just a few weeks ago that much of the \u201cmental load\u201d problem outlined by the author is selling herself and her husband short, and here\u2019s how I figured it out:\n\nMy boyfriend and I came home late from the gym one night and I was getting ready to prepare dinner. I was just going to reheat some leftovers, but the sink was full of dishes, and the dishwasher was full of clean ones. The countertops had food debris from breakfast, and I noticed the floors were sticky. It was late. I was tired. I took a deep breath and tried to figure out what exactly I *could* get done before the microwave timer went out. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d My boyfriend asked.\n\n\u201cI want to get to bed early tonight but the dishwasher is full of clean dishes and the sink is full of dirty ones and we won\u2019t have anything to cook with tomorrow if I just leave it and the countertops are messy and I still have to make dinner.\u201d I huffed. \u201cI just wish I could be done with it by the time dinner is done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re eating leftovers.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s going to take like 5 minutes at most.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I know, I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s more important to me right now.\u201d I told him, figuring I\u2019d deliberate while I got things ready. I decide to take out the food to reheat, remember there\u2019s something in the freezer I want to add, and I start prepping food and strategizing. Next thing I know, he tells me he\u2019ll handle the clean dishes if I handle everything else. Can\u2019t argue with that, right? So I got right to it, got out the broom, started replacing the clean dishes he\u2019d just removed with dirty ones, and managed to get the counters wiped off in-between sweeping.\n\n**By the time my microwave went off, my boyfriend and I had completed everything I had wanted to get done.**\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I was overtly appreciative. I was blindsided by his kindness and generosity with his time. Work follows him home more often than not, and he just took time out of doing that to help me. This made a light switch go off in my head. What did I do here that was *so* different from that comic that my boyfriend was very in touch with my mental wellbeing in that moment and helped me *without my asking?* \n\nI thought back to this moment through the night and through the rest of the day. I remembered like nine things from RPW literature somewhere. I used an I want statement, and I had let myself be vulnerable to him\u2026 what else did I do?\n\nEver since that first night, I\u2019ve been experimenting with this. He\u2019s the type to kick off his shoes and leave the living room covered with work related items, his bag, his coat, etc. One day, we were expecting company, and I said \u201cI want to try to keep the living room area clear so we\u2019re not scrambling to clean it every time you have guys night.\u201d Next thing I know, he started putting his work things on his computer chair and desk in the bedroom instead. The second time I tried it, we were about to go out for drinks, but again, dishes and laundry! \u201cI just don\u2019t want to have to worry about our laundry rotting in the washer overnight but also I need to do dishes again.\u201d Then he tells me he will handle the laundry if I do the dishes, and then we\u2019re done and gone out for a night of fun in less than 15 minutes.\n\n**I shared my mental load with him, and he helped me aleviate my problem.**\n\nI ended up sharing these experiences with some of the fine ladies here, and we all debated on what was going on, what was at work, etc and I thought it worthy of a post.\n\nWhy does sharing your mental load instead of delegating tasks work?\n\n\n1. You are bringing your problem to your captain. *The REAL problem, not just a task at hand. You\u2019re admitting that sometimes, running the household stuff is hard work, and everyone needs help.*     \n2. You are putting your captain in a leadership position. *You tell him the issue, he decides what he is the most comfortable with doing and what he thinks you can handle. He becomes the delegator, not you.*     \n3. You are demonstrating that you respect his opinions and value his input. *He\u2019s getting an opportunity to save the day and you\u2019re cementing the fact that he is a respectable and needed member of the household.*     \n4. You are asking him for help without emasculating him or nagging him. *Everyone knows men don\u2019t like being nagged. We are not his mother!*     \n\n\nSo what does effectively sharing your mental load look like? First of all, this is not a way to shirk your responsibilities in the household. If you were playing on your phone all day, and suddenly you have all these things to do and you want his help, if he\u2019s worth his salt he\u2019s going to call you out on your time management, and rightly so. This also has potential to not work with certain captains, especially if the relationship is rocky and you\u2019re just starting out implementing RPW strategy. If you have an otherwise functional RPW type relationship, however, I think this has is a great way to attack the household issues as a team.\n\nHere are the steps I\u2019ve identified.\n\n1. Use \u201cI want\u201d statements to explain the situation to your captain. Citing the coffee table example: \u201cI want to get the groceries in the fridge but the laundry basket is full and the living room is a mess and I keep running into things that need done while I\u2019m trying to do those.\u201d\n2. Let him decide the best course of action moving forward. Respect his decision to help or not help, but if he delegates a task to you, respect him by doing that task. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you handle the groceries and I\u2019ll round up the laundry and we can figure it out from there.\u201d\n3. Express your appreciation to him in the form of affection, compliments, etc. \u201cMy hero! Oh my gosh thank you so much! I couldn\u2019t have done it all without you!\u201d If he has decided that you can handle it on your own and you felt that you couldn\u2019t. Tell him about it playfully. \u201cI just did the dishes and the laundry and I cleaned out the fridge and deep cleaned the bathroom, vacuumed, got that stain out of Sally\u2019s shirt, and I\u2019m dead tired.\u201d\n\nWith a little practice, this should come easy to you when high stress situations arise at home. Adopting the mentality towards \u201cthe mental load\u201d in \u201cYou Should\u2019ve Asked!\u201d is an extremely unfair way for anyone to treat their significant other and avoiding this pitfall can easily improve communication in the household. \n","title":"FR: The Mental Load: Why we shouldn't follow it and what to do instead.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/akwzit\/fr_the_mental_load_why_we_shouldnt_follow_it_and\/"}

As a woman it might be hard to understand this. **Regardless of whether or not they want it, the wiring of the male brain creates a instinctive pull to visually consume the image of an attractive woman. These images can be live or recollections and are just as alluring either way.** \n\nThis comes up for men in two ways. The first is when a woman who is dressed to show off a great body. This woman is an eye magnet and it is difficult for a man to avoid noticing her. Even when he he doesn\u2019t look, he is *acutely aware of her presence*. The second is through mental image files that every man keeps. Even when an eye magnet woman is not *present* every man has a mental file of images that can intrude without warning *or* be called up at will. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n###What every woman should know about the visual wiring of men. \n\nBoth looking and remembering are related to a type of brain wiring that is almost universal among men (*some women may have it too, but not most*). \n\n**A man\u2019s brain structure and chemical mix wire him to be visually oriented**. This makes him more likely to perceive attractive images as sexual. **It triggers an initial reaction that is instinctive and automatic**. From there he can chose to apply willpower on how he will behave. \n\nThe response comes from the part of the brain that controls unconscious processes such as digestion and breathing. It is the part that lights up when you are hungry and see a buffet. In this scenario, you will notice and be drawn towards the food on a gut level *then* your conscious thoughts and will power kick in *from a different part of the brain*. Clinical studies show these same processes at work when a man sees a woman dressed in an attractive manner. **He will be automatically drawn to her before having the conscious thought to pull away.** \n\nThis is hard to understand because women do not activate the same part of the brain at the sight of an attractive man. When *we* see an attractive man, our *thinking* centers light up. And we *think* \u201che\u2019s an attractive man\u201d. From the onset, ours is a *thinking* response. This makes it difficult for women to understand the automatic and reflexive nature of a man\u2019s response to sexy stimuli.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Compulsion One: A man can\u2019t *not* notice\n\n> From the surveys: Imagine you are sitting alone in a train station and a woman with a great body walks in and stands in line. What is your reaction?\n\n98% of men respond that they cannot **not** notice. While only 4% say that they will openly stare and drool, 76% are drawn to sneak a peak and 18% are acutely aware that the woman is there and struggle not to look. Only 2% of men have no reaction. \n\nThese results are the same across demographics. **Nearly all men describe having difficult not looking when they are exposed to a sexy woman**.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Compulsion Two: A man has a mental photo file of sensual images\n\nWe know from chapter 6 that men think about sex a lot. What we might not realize is that they aren\u2019t thinking about this in words (\u201cI\u2019d like to have sex tonight\u201d) rather they have a sensual picture in their head. \n\nThese pictures can be of us, their loving wives and girlfriends but not always. Sometimes, these can be images that are burned into their brains from what they\u2019ve seen out in the world. \n\nAt times these mental pictures can be memories of you. Other times they are memories of a woman he saw walking down the street three weeks ago. Still other times it can be a Playboy magazine he read three months back. *One man claimed to have an unending supply of pictures in his head stretching back to his teens.* \n\n> From the surveys: Many men have a set of sensual images that rise up or can be conjured up in their minds, does this apply to you?\u201d  \n\nOnly 25% of men say that they do not have a set of mental images. The remainder claim that they do have those pictures in their head and they can either be recent or from years gone by. **A full 87% of men say that these images regularly pop up in their minds**.  \n\nThis is so different from how women experience the world that the author\u2019s husband didn\u2019t believe her when she told him this doesn\u2019t happen to her. He thought she was embarrassed to admit the truth, and couldn\u2019t believe her until a group of women shared her denial. *We truly are wired differently!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Why these pictures pop up\n\nThere is a shortcut for certain types of memories that bypasses the thinking centers of the brain. It is traced to the amygdala which is the part that acts as a repository for the memories that are tied to gut level responses.  The instinctive reaction to a provocatively dressed woman is exactly the sort of gut level memory that is stored away in the amygdala. **These visceral images are able to bypass thinking and simply pop back up in his mind.** \n\nWe, women, might experience something similar with emotions which is what our brains are wired to process. If you\u2019ve had emotional memories pop up unexpectedly (or unwantedly) then you understand what these picture-memories are for men \n\nNow, imagine what the sex saturated culture must be like. The act of living today can be a minefield for a man who doesn\u2019t want these images in his brain or a smorgasbord for a man who does. Husband listened to this chapter with me and jumped in at this point: \n\n> Yes! It\u2019s all over. I mean, YOGA PANTS! And at the gym, some women don\u2019t even wear underwear!!\n\nMen told the author that these sexual thoughts or images barge into their brain *all the time*. Of course, we want to know what \"all the time\" means and one man describes it like this: \n\n>If you are talking about a teenage boy all the time means **all. the. time**. It can be every few hours and last for a half hour before the thought passes. For a 20 something man it is still pretty frequent. Once men reach their 30s an onward  it is less frequent and more often triggered by something. Once those thoughts are triggered, the man has to make a great effort to tear them down if he wants to. The longer he entertains the image, the harder it is to get rid of. \n\n**These thoughts are both normal and have no bearing on a man\u2019s devotion to his relationship**. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###How it works\n\n**Step 1**: *For every man sensual images & thoughts arise involuntarily.* Men have the thoughts whether they want them or not. If the stimulus is there so is the response. It might not even register to the man that he had the thought until a second or two after it occurs. \n\n  *Try this thought experiment to understand how it works*.\n\n >Imagine walking into a classroom and seeing these words on the board: *Don\u2019t Read This*  \n\n > I tell you, \u201cno really, don\u2019t read it, just look at the letters\u201d. Did you not read it? \n\n > That is what it\u2019s like for a guy. His brain reads \u201cNice Body\u201d just like you read \u201cdon\u2019t read this\u201d.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 2**: *Every man\u2019s involuntary physical impulse is to enjoy the feelings associated with the thoughts and images*. Because men are hardwired to be sexual hunters, every thought & image associated with that pursuit comes with powerful feelings. \n\n **When a sensual image enters a man\u2019s mind, it brings a rush of temporary pleasure. This initial physical sensation is involuntary.** \n\n The author relays a story. When her son was 4 years old, he stopped in front of the Victoria Secret store and he stared in awe. When his parents asked him what he was doing, he pointed and said *\u201cI like those ladies, their bare tummies make my tummy feel good\u201d*. At four, he was *obviously* too young to understand sex, but he still had a male brain and thus the same reaction as all men. \n\n A married man describes the physical sensation to the author: \n\n >When an image plays on a man\u2019s brian or he gazes at an attractive woman, it\u2019s not just pure lust. There is a thrill there. A man can go back to that adrenaline rush by entertaining those images. \n\n **The feeling is both enticing and difficult to resist.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 3:** *Every man can make a choice to dwell on the images and thoughts or dismiss them*. Many men make the decisions to strike down these unwanted mental pictures. The biggest factor in whether a man made this choice was whether or not he regularly attended religious services. Because religion\u2019s demand mental purity, those men disciplined themselves to stop looking. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Reassurances for the wives and girlfriends\n\n* **ONE** He probably wishes he could reserve his visual nature just for you. Most men said they enjoy being visual but would reserve it entirely for their partners if they could. They don\u2019t love the distraction that today\u2019s images regularly throw at him. \n\n* **TWO** He can see a beautiful woman without *sexual* temptation. The temptation to look often isn\u2019t sexual. A lot of it is about admiring beauty. \n\n* **THREE** Every man is different and discipline makes a difference. Each man experiences a different level of temptation. For some it\u2019s a small nuisance and for some it\u2019s a stumbling block. Have you ever struggled to not eat a piece of cake?  Some women will have an easier time turning away while others will have an internal struggle.\n\n* **FOUR** It\u2019s not because of you. Some of us may wonder, *What is wrong with me? Am I not attractive enough?* This truly is something that every man experiences and has little to do with you. Love your husband as a man. This is a part of what makes him a man. Even if you were a model, your husband would still experience these images. \n\n* **FIVE**. This doesn't impact his feelings for you. The biological temptation has no impact on a man\u2019s feelings for his SO. There is no competition between his wife and the woman who catches his eye. It is truly just an observation of the other woman. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###What\u2019s a woman to do? \n\n**In short, nothing. Do not be alarmed and try to change your man**. Do not hound or punish your man for his wiring. Just as we expect our men to not dwell on these thoughts, he should be able to expect us to not dwell on our insecurities. If you feel worry rising up remember that this is one of element of male-ness. **You will not find a man who isn\u2019t wired this way**. \n\n\n> A churchgoing man speaks: \u201cI wish my wife would accept the struggle I have with lust and encourage me rather than freak out and conclude the worst about me. The more I can reveal my weakness without being judged or accused or without a major crisis in our relationship resulting from my transparency the more I know I am loved for who I am and not for who she wants me to be\u201d. \n\n*Do we love the men in our lives for who they are or for who we want them to be? Do we want to support our men or change them?* \n\nThe only person you can change is yourself. If you find your man noticing other women, handle it with maturity and grace *even if it makes you uncomfortable*. **It is destructive to become hurt and suspicious when it\u2019s not warranted. Be a support and a soft place to land.** If you aren\u2019t safe to talk to, he won\u2019t talk to you. \n\nNotice and appreciate his efforts to not look. If you pay attention, you\u2019ll see how often he is exposed to attractive women and sexy images. Love him for the effort he makes not to look. Sometimes, commenting on the woman (*\u201dHey, she was pretty*\u201d) will relieve his stress at the effort not to notice. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe author, coming from a Christian background, recommends that now that you understand how men view the world, you consider respecting *men* by dressing in a  modest manner. Men find it hard to believe that women don\u2019t realize what they are doing when they dress in a provocative manner. Because our brains are not wired in the same way, *many women do not realize*. The imagines in men\u2019s heads come from somewhere and we can help not provide those images to men who do not want them. We may think we look cute but he\u2019s instinctively picturing us naked. Religious men in particular struggle to keep their thoughts pure and you in a short skirt isn\u2019t helping. \n\nWhile *I* don\u2019t personally ascribe to her beliefs, I *do* believe that if you are going to dress in a sexy and attention grabbing manner (and ladies this includes anything from downright trashy to the pencil skirt that hugs your butt at work), then you *cannot* get upset with your man for taking a peak at another girl on the street. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Love and understand your man rather than letting your own insecurities punish him for something he cannot control**\n","title":"'For Women Only' - Men are Visual - Chapter 7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/90u0kb\/for_women_only_men_are_visual_chapter_7\/"}

Use essential oils to clean a place aromatically. Spritz a little lavender on the bed sheets, put sage oil in the doorways, lemon-eucalyptus in the entryway\/bathroom\/kitchen. It's an immediate & total refresh on the energy of the space if you don't have time to do a full clean.\n\n- Lacking sex\/romance or stuck in a rut: Again, use smell \/ muscle memory. Put an outfit together with perfume that conjures memories of an awesome romantic day together. Take a walk outside or dance to your favorite music to brew up joy within yourself. Wear something sexy that doesn't \"require\" sex as a response (not spendy lingerie, but maybe nice sweatpants + a crop top or a silky robe + panties). When he does give you that good dxck, tell him how good he was & give him the pets he likes immediately afterward. Train him how to treat you.\n\n- You are not communicating well or have \"nothing to talk about\": Do something new on your own. Listen to your old favorite album. Put on something sexy just for yourself while you do self-care. When you are with him next, tell him a story about how you are\/were feeling: What does the weather smell like? What does the fabric of your dress remind you of?\n\n- Sweetie had a bad day, or you have fallen down on your duties: Thank & compliment. Thank sweetie for patience & giving you space while you are not doing your best. Thank him for how hard he works. Compliment him on how sweet he is during your hard times. Compliment him on how impressive he is at what he does.\n\n- Dude is pissed: Don't defend; if you defend, you are attacked. Listen, apologize, keep an open stance - physically & mentally. Stand your ground by vocalizing your wants & needs. Don't voice what you want as a solution (\"I want more time with you\"), voice your problem (\"I'm feeling lonely, I want to feel connected\").\n\n- If you feel like a raisin: STOP GIVING OR DOING TOO MUCH. If you aren't feeling juicy, stop putting yourself there. Yes, it's great to be caring & supportive & provide comfort - but you can't authentically do this if you don't already feel juicy in yourself. Work yourself back up into a juicy state, & then you can go back to being a love-bug. You don't have to be mean, but there can be a storm over your waters - without you blaming it on anyone else - so buckle down, protect your resources, & be a weather reporter about the conditions on your island if asked.\n\nAlso, never do this shxt for someone who is not a Good Man.

After dinner, we were hanging out at the bar, listening to a musician who was playing that night.\n\nIt was just a quiet, chill time, until I had the idea to do some doodling on bar napkins. (I admit that I already had a drink in me and was sipping the second.)\n\nSo I made a big show of hiding my work from my husband, and in the meantime I sketched a penis and a vagina and revealed them with a big flourish. Then I turned the sketch into a cactus and a flower. My husband was looking at me, kind of smiling and shaking his head, like, \"okay, you goofball.\"  I studied his face very carefully, drew his \"portrait\" and dramatically signed my masterpiece. \n\nAt that point, my husband was laughing and got into it too. He grabbed some napkins and totally negged me with a caricature that had me squealing \"I don't look like that!!\" Then he drew me naked. And so on. We were laughing hard and having a blast. \n\n**Enter the Manic Pixie Dream Girl**\n\nOn RPW, we often talk about the virtues of being childlike (as opposed to childish). Childlike qualities include being playful, sunny, carefree, whimsical, lighthearted and a bit crazy--the good crazy.\n\nNow, I personally *don't* like the term \"childlike\" in this context. I get it. I also get why people find it confusing or gross (is it childlike to draw funny penises at the bar? Eh..)\n\nIf childlike works for you, run with it. However, for me, a better and more culturally resonant comparison is the trope of the **manic pixie dream girl** (MPDG).\n\nThe MPDG is a female fictional character who's playful and fun, who makes the brooding male protagonist catch the feelz. The film critic Roger Ebert described her as \u201ca girl who is completely available, absolutely desirable and really likes you\u201d (in regards to Natalie Portman's character in Garden State). He also called her an \"unbelievable movie creature.\" And, of course, feminists hate hate hate the MPDG.\n\nSo. Forget childlike if you don't like that term. Take up the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.\n\n No, not all the time, as that would make you annoying. And not just for any man, but for the right man. Do it consciously, using the right dose. Add dashes of the MPDG to your dating, to your relationship, to your sex life.

Although films and fictional books are generally not discussed here, I think the culture around us is a huge force that shapes us with blue pill beliefs. For example, the character, Maggie O'Connell on the TV series *Northern Exposure* ruined me for years. Based on the sexual tension between her and the male lead character, I thought that men liked abrasive, sassy women, and that sweet women were boring doormats. It took years to rectify this misconception, and I certainly don't want my children to fall into this trap.\n\nAlso, picture is worth a thousand words. Film moments can convey to concepts in ways that reading words on a screen can't. So, having said all this, I'd like to explore some of the red-pilled concepts and examples in the movie Groundhog Day.\n\nThe premise is that Phil (played by Bill Murray) a weather anchorman is stuck in a time loop where he re-lives the same day over and over in a small town that he's visiting with his co-workers.\n\nThe love interest, Rita (played by Andie MacDowell) is a good example of a **strong feminine woman**. These are some of the things I want my daughter to cultivate.\n\n* **She's kind, compassionate, sweet, and playful**. She may admonish Phil's bad behavior, but she is not abrasive.\n* **She is** **a woman with a career, not a career woman**. She wants to do a good job as a producer, but she is not overtly masculine in the way she goes about doing her job, or overly aggressive. She get's it done in a feminine way. I also got the impression that she would want to be a wife and mother.\n* **She has** **strong boundaries**. Although she is sweet and kind, she does not hesitate to put her foot down when Phil pressures her into sex. And when he crosses a line, she slaps him.\n* **She also has a good vetting filter**. She is repelled by him when he is a jerk and suspicious when he games her. When he finally changes into a HVM, then she is attracted to him.\n\nPhil undergoes his own transformation from a jerk to a HVM. Starting out as a cynical, not-so-nice guy, he looks down on the small town folk. Initially he uses the time loop to engage in debauchery. Then he tries to game Rita over and over, using accumulated knowledge from her to help his game. After being rebuffed repeatedly, he becomes destructive and tries to commit suicide unsuccessfully.\n\nIn the last stage, Phil decides to undergo a process of improving himself and to help the people around him. He begins to exhibit the traits that I want my son to have:\n\n* **He works on himself.** Phil decides to take piano lessons, learns how to sculpt ice, reads literature.\n* **He is internally motivated.** He's improving himself not to get some girl, but for himself. That is something I often see in MRP, where guys are embarking on self improvement to gain approval of their wives, only to be told that they need to refocus the frame on themselves.\n* **He finds his own mission.** He decides to use his knowledge of what's going to happen to help the townsfolk. He goes around town changing a tire for old ladies, catching a kid who falls out of a tree, and saving the life of a man who's choking.\n* Rita is not his mission: When Phil delivers a heartfelt speech during his news segment, Rita beginning to feel intrigued by him and asks if he wants to have coffee. Instead of jumping on that opportunity, which his old self would have done, he responds that he would love to but he has some errands to run. These \"errands\" are his mission of helping out the townsfolk. He has a responsibility and an obligation to do good, and that takes precedence over chasing skirts. He maintained frame.\n\nAt the end of the film he becomes a HVM. Rita finds him playing jazz piano at a party. People are constantly coming up to him and thanking him for something he's done. There is a bachelor's auction where Phil is auctioned off and women are fighting over him, outbidding each other. The red-pilled would immediately recognize that this is a demonstration of social proof: **women want men that other women want.** Seeing that other women are bidding on Phil, Rita outbids them all and gets him for the night. She is now intrigued and attracted to Phil. At this point, I casually commented to my son that chasing women and trying to convince them to be with you is a weak strategy. Rather, it's a much better strategy to become an amazing man, and then women will more attracted to you.\n\nAll in all I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. I hope you get a chance to watch this with a red-pilled lens and see if you can apply some of these concepts to your life. I certainly will.","title":"Red-pilled concepts and lessons from Groundhog Day (useful for red-pilled parenting)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/huvlmo\/redpilled_concepts_and_lessons_from_groundhog_day\/"}

In modern times, it becomes increasingly difficult for women to settle because women nowadays want a man who has higher level education, higher salary, higher social status. \n\nI have noticed a trend in a handful of my girlfriends. They are attractive women who have postgraduate degrees, working in white collar jobs with middle to upper middle class salaries, and they have chosen to marry\/date a man with traditionally masculine qualities.\n\nBy traditionally masculine qualities I mean that these men may not have as high of a salary or even the same level of education, but he has physical strength, street smarts, hands-on skills, social skills, athletic ability, a sense of protection. Typically these men can be found in jobs of law enforcement, military, emergency services, aviation, vocational trades or sports\/fitness, essentially jobs that are not so academic but require a different set of skills. They tend to be more \"rough and tumble\" types of men. They have jobs that utilize their testosterone - jobs that require physical strength, aggression, stoicism, or adrenaline. \n\nI have also noticed with these more traditionally masculine men, they could care less about women's intelligence and appreciate her femininity, domesticity and companionship. For certain modern women, this can be a relief in a world of feminized, neutral gender roles - she can utilize her womanhood and not feel like she has to compete with a man, because **he doesn't care and he is not with her because he expects her to keep up. He treats her like a woman and only expects her softness and feminine qualities.**\n\n*And for some women who feel the pressure to be masculine because of \"equality,\" this is a relief.*\n\nHas anyone noticed this trend? It could be among more conservative cultures, but I find there are some liberal career women who DO choose a man with more traditional values, because she actually wishes for this gender dynamic.

This is happening once again and as a frequent poster and EC, I'm extremely tired of answering the same, unoriginal questions and defending the philosophy. I hope this post clears up questions some of you may have out there. If I missed any, feel free to add in the comments.\n\n * *The Red Pill hates women, how could women support it?* The Red Pill does not hate women. The Red Pill explains who we are as humans and as specific genders **in general** at our most base instincts. While some of the harsh truths may not be flattering to women, they aren't flattering to men either. If men were perfect there would be no need for TRP because men wouldn't be beta-ing out (read: failing) at life. TRP helps rehabilitate men and women alike, cut through all the crap the feminist agenda has been feeding us our whole lives and reconnect with our natural instincts and purposes. \n\n The men on TRP have a phase of anger that they go through when they \u201cswallow the red pill\u201d. Women typically have a guilt phase. We encourage women not to visit TRP because the men working through the anger phase obviously can be abrasive and offensive. They need a space to do that in. Let them be! Not every RP guy is like that, it just seems the norm because of the space you\u2019re visiting; in reality it is a small percentage of the population.\n\n * *TRP thinks women are below men* \nMen and women are different and have different roles. Neither gender\u2019s role is more important than the other and neither gender is better than the other. Men are just **better** at certain things than women are and women are **better** at certain things than men are. (**IN GENERAL** Obviously there are exceptions to everything!) \n\n That doesn\u2019t mean women can\u2019t hold jobs to be truly RPW or we can\u2019t handle the finances or whatever. That actually has nothing to do with anything. It does seem to be somewhat normal that many RPW aspire to be homemakers but I believe that has to do with the fact that RPW aligns with traditional\/conservative values\/families and not because it is an RPW \u201crule\u201d itself. \n\n No one ever said men were better than women. Yes, again, I\u2019m well aware that there are some less than flattering posts about women on TRP. I\u2019m sure some of the men over there do think they\u2019re better but they\u2019re the exception and not the rule. \n\n * *RPW don\u2019t want a RP man** \n\n This is another one of those phrases that gets repeated so much it loses its meaning. RPW do not want a guy that is a player. Some of the men at TRP use their RP skills to spin plates, some have decided to never marry, some have decided to just get laid as much as possible. That\u2019s OK! That\u2019s what they have decided to do with their sexual strategy. RPW do not want to do that. Instead we want to vet a long term partner. So when people say \u201cRPW don\u2019t wan a RP man\u201d what they really mean to say is they don\u2019t want the guys who spin plates and sleep around. \n But just as much as an RPW wouldn\u2019t want an RP guy like that, the RP guy isn\u2019t looking for an RPW - he\u2019s looking for a ONS - something he won\u2019t get from us! I was asked a few days ago how and why I would identify with a network where the men are people I wouldn\u2019t date but that isn\u2019t true. I just wouldn\u2019t date one of *those* RP guys. There are a few regular posters here that give great advice and seem (albeit while just on the internet) like they would be solid relationship material. One of our own mods is a man and *gasp!* RP!!!!! But guess what, he\u2019s admitted to being in relationships before. \nThere are plenty of RP men who want relationships. *Those* are the RP men women want to date. \n\nI believe the part that gets twisted in people\u2019s minds is the \u201calpha\u201d part. If a guy is too far alpha one way, he will only be looking out for himself and thus would not make a good long term partner. However even this belief is a generalization because there are some men who sit high on the alpha spectrum that are family men. So the simple answer to this particular \u201crule\u201d and its exception is, vet your men, ladies. \n\n  * *RPW is all about how to improve for the man but what is the man doing to improve?*\n\n That\u2019s a great question. RPW can\u2019t answer that for you though. The only person you have control over in this life is you. *You* have the power to change and RPW (or TRP) can help. The idea is that if you change enough for your SO, you *may* inspire change in them by motivating them to be better. Maybe that will work, maybe it won\u2019t. There is always the chance that the guy you\u2019re dating won\u2019t step up and lead or won\u2019t be motivated by your hard work to change or won\u2019t do anything. Guess what? *Leave him*. He\u2019s not captain  material and your SMV\/RMW is too high to be wasting your time with someone like that. It\u2019s that simple.\n\n In conclusion, TRP and RPW work with the same theories but have many different goals and ways of reaching those goals. But that\u2019s ok! You don\u2019t have to use all the strategies and theories in your life. My RPW journey looks much different than any other user\u2019s. That\u2019s OK! We also have different goals in life and different beliefs. \nNot every RPW wants children or is a Christian. I am. That doesn\u2019t mean the strategies haven\u2019t improved our lives. Maybe there\u2019s a guy at TRP who thinks women suck and are only good for sleeping with. That\u2019s OK! I won\u2019t be his friend and I certainly won\u2019t sleep with him but he can do as he pleases. \nThere\u2019s also men over there that, as I said before, are in relationships. There\u2019s a vast majority of people and ideas across TRP network. If there\u2019s a particular train of thought, idea, theory or tenant you don\u2019t like or don\u2019t agree with, don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bath water. Just don\u2019t use whatever you don\u2019t agree with. \n\n I hope this has cleared up a few popular misconceptions for some users. I expect there to be debate in the comments and possibly even lively debate but can we please all be respectful of each other. You can be direct without being rude. I\u2019ve noticed some people forgetting their manners and being excessively and unnecessarily aggressive lately and I for one have grown weary of it. \n\n ~Sadie  \n\n Edited: formatting and clarity on key ideas\n","title":"Misconceptions","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5jopnk\/misconceptions\/"}

And they can't abide seeing someone doing something differently, or even the same way, who is happy.\n\nThe same feminists can complain that a happy housewife is abiding by a 1950s patriarchal structure that oppresses her and that a happy career woman is sleeping her way to the top. The same feminists can complain that a happy young mother is being hurt and oppressed and that a single woman happily sleeping with a number of men is being used by them. Whenever someone claims to be happy, feminism is here to say \"No, you're not, you're just kidding yourself. REALLY you're sad and hurt and miserable.\"\n\nThe only women feminism seems to like? Sad women. If a woman is an unhappy housewife airing her dirty laundry then that's fine. If a career woman admits to sleeping her way to the top or complains about how hard it is and how lonely she is, then she's encouraged. If a young mother is stressed, overworked and doesn't really like her children, that is admirable. If a woman is sleeping around and having difficulty coming to terms with her feelings on it then she is lauded as some sort of heroine. When you're miserable, feminism is here to cuddle you, coddle you and tell you that it's all men's fault, or the patriarchy's fault if there isn't a man to directly blame. The unhappy housewife is oppressed by internalized misogyny and her husband. The career woman is oppressed by her male coworkers and the glass ceiling. The young mother is oppressed by her children and their father. The single woman is oppressed by these noncomittal men and her own internalized misogyny.\n\nMainstream feminism sets out looking for illness, makes it up or creates it when it fails to find it and presents itself as the cure to these ailments.\n\nAnd in many ways this seeking can actually help. Looking for social illness **when there is an illness** can help. If someone is genuinely unhappy, why shouldn't they look for the cause? It has helped people overcome all forms of discrimination and has helped us craft a world where we are largely free to do as we please, largely without hurting other people. But when the illness is not there, it hurts. Because feminism can't exist without illness. It needs to be the source of a cure, or, when there is no cure, it needs to be the treatment itself. When the children are healthy, feminism needs to feed them rat poison and break their legs so it can heal them again. When the children can't be hurt, feminism needs to lock them indoors and tell them they are ill until it can poison them again.\n\nBecause if people, especially women, are happy, feminism can't do anything. So it must assume everyone is ill, convince everyone they are ill and its followers must make themselves ill so that feminism can keep on curing people.\n\nAnd this is why we need to avoid this sort of thought pattern.\n\nFeminism tries to make you ill or make you think you are ill insidiously.\n\nIt says you are being hurt if you're a happy housewife.\n\nIt says you are being oppressed if you're a working woman.\n\nIt says your male partners can't lay a finger on you even if you beat them black and blue.\n\nIt says that forcing you into sex and denying you sex are both just as violent.\n\nWhen an unhappy feminist, even a normally rational mainstream feminist, or feminist-lite, questions your happiness, that is because they need to find an illness to cure. They want you to be ill.\n\nBut that isn't a healthy mentality. When you are continually dissatisfied, continually looking for the next best thing and continually looking for reasons not to be happy, you are *guaranteed* to be unhappy. No matter who you are, what you do, who you're with or where you're heading, if you are looking for oppression, unhappiness and the likes, it will find you.\n\nBy all means, if you are genuinely unhappy take a long hard look at yourself, your situation and ask why.\n\nBut if it isn't broken, don't break it just so you can fix it.","title":"Mainstream feminism is the Munchhausen by proxy of ideologies.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/3bz4b5\/mainstream_feminism_is_the_munchhausen_by_proxy\/"}

In my role, my job is to give advice surrounding management problems my executives may be facing. They make the final decisions and they lead \u2013 my job is to counsel and help persuade them to make (what I think are) the best decisions, to think through the risks and consequences of various paths, and to provide industry best practice knowledge.\n\nI remember one occasion early in my career where I had upset an executive which is not uncommon as our priorities often conflict (seem similar to romantic relationships between men and women?!). I can\u2019t remember the topic but I do remember I told him \u201cno\u201d in a way that was very blunt and offered him little to no room to move forward in the way he wanted. In a coaching session with my female boss, she told me: \u201cYou need to just be submissive a little bit. I hate to use that word, but I can\u2019t think of a better one. Apologize for the situation even though you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and defer to him.\u201d This was a light bulb moment for me; you can see the similarities with the RPW approach because it works on men in all situations.\n\nHere are some of my key takeaways from working with executive leaders that you can apply to your relationships and vetting:\n\n**1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They want problems solved**.\n\nWhen faced with a problem, men want it solved as quickly and efficiently as possible. They don\u2019t want to spend too much time talking about how\/why it occurred, how people feel about it, who did what, etc. To them, this is drama. They just want to know:\n\na) What is the problem (in simple, short terms).\n\nb) \u00a0What are the options that can solve it.\n\nc) What are the various consequences of potential solutions (positive and negative outcomes).\n\nTo add value as a partner, you should offer various options to solving a problem. As much as possible, if you can appear to be objective in your recommendations rather than being focused on pushing what serves your best interest only (often ignoring his best interest), you will get further and your opinions will be more trusted in the future.\n\n**2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They don\u2019t want to be told what to do and language matters.**\n\nThis seems obvious as no one wants to be told what to do, but men specifically don\u2019t react well to being *told* what to do, especially when faced with a problem or in a situation where they may have asked you for advice which already places them in a vulnerable position. Many men are open to advice, but women often frame it up poorly (or are so excited to be asked, they don\u2019t take a minute to think through what they are about to say) which leads to a negative and defensive reaction from the man.\n\nFraming advice up poorly can include language like:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou just need to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI told you before you should\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have more experience with X\u201d or \u201cI know more about X so you should do it my way.\u201d\n\nThere are many ways you can offer advice or opinions to a man and even influence the outcome you want while helping him save face. These include:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using positive affirming phrases that express empathy and build his confidence such as my favorite, \u201cYou may have already thought of this but what about <my idea here>\u201d or \u201cThis is a difficult decision but you are a great leader and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make the right call.\u201d The latter is quite similar to Laura Doyle\u2019s Spouse Fulfilling Prophecies\u201d (SPFs) which encourage such statements of confidence where you explicitly state the behavior you want to see.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asking questions rather than stating demands. These can include ideas you have such as: \u201cHave you considered\u2026?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think about\u2026?\u201d \u201cWhat are some ideas you have so far?\u201d Get him talking and expressing his thought process and suddenly the whole thing becomes collaborative rather than you against him. You are now acting as a team.\n\n**3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Giving bad news.**\n\nSometimes you have to say no or give bad news to your leader, it\u2019s inevitable, and you know in advance they will be disappointed. Some tactics you can use to soften the blow are:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Share how things will be different next time (e.g. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do X today but I will tomorrow\u201d or \u201cIn the future, we can try to X so this won\u2019t happen again).\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apologize even when it\u2019s not your fault. This is not new RPW advice but I find IS underused. You don\u2019t always have to admit wrongdoing to apologize but can apologize for the conflict in general. In a relationship context, I use \u201cI am sorry, I hate when we fight\u201d when I didn\u2019t make a specific mistake I feel I can call out but just want to say I\u2019m sorry we are having conflict and I love you. Usually the response is \u201cI hate fighting with you too\u201d and a hug.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The absence of a \u201cyes\u201d is a \u201cno.\u201d You don\u2019t always have to directly say \u201cno\u201d to your partner to express you won\u2019t\/can\u2019t do something. If it is not an urgent issue, even if you know you can\u2019t do it, your best bet is to ask for some time to think about it or say something vague like \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d or \"let's deal with it tomorrow\" rather than come outright with a no. Yes you can\u2019t always avoid problems forever but saying no off the bat first thing makes him feel like you aren\u2019t even considering his POV. Giving it some time and just not saying yes but letting it sit is less hurtful to his ego and makes him feel heard. Nothing is worse on a man (and a woman for that matter) than feeling immediately shut down.\n\n**4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The best leaders are open to advice**.\n\nThe best leaders want advice from others and are eager to listen to their opinions, especially when that person is an expert in a certain area they are not (e.g. you SAHMs are experts in homemaking). In the vetting stage, you should see how open your leader is to your perspective. Do they ask for your opinion on things? This doesn\u2019t mean they ask your opinion on EVERYTHING (and we don\u2019t want that!) but do they ask when they can feel maybe you are hesitant about something, encouraging you to speak up if you are shy? Do they seem to actively listen when you are sharing? Or do they get defensive if you offer your opinion? If they get defensive when you offer an opinion, examine the language you are using as in point 2 above and see if the way you expressed it can be modified in order for it to be received better.\n\n**5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keep things fun and light, even in tense times.**\n\nBeing the \u201cgoddess of fun and light\u201d is not a new concept for RPW but can sometimes go out the window in moments of conflict. Every day I use smiling, cracking jokes, laughing, and humor to defuse tense situations and it absolutely works. Even on phone calls, a cheery tone and a laugh can set the stage for a more chill conversation following perhaps a tense email exchange. Have you ever had a tense text exchange with a partner, so they call you, and you answer rudely with a tone right off the bat? I have. Try instead answering cheerfully, even if it\u2019s fake. Make a joke or giggle - it will immediately take the edge off and he\u2019ll approach you more eager to resolve the situation. He'll think \"Ok I was upset at first but maybe it's not as serious as I thought.\"\n\nAnd try as hard as you can not to take yourself too seriously or exaggerate a situation as being more serious than it is. Remember that \u201cfeelings are not facts\u201d and your feelings don\u2019t have to be acted on just because they exist. Furthermore, you don\u2019t have to solve something *immediately* for it to get solved *eventually*. \u00a0Things are not as urgent as you likely make them out to be.\n\n\n\nMasculine powerful men want someone who is agreeable as [this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1dds2z4\/agreeable_women_what_tactics_have_worked_for_you\/) from u\/ArkNemesis00 recently reminded us. However this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t influence a man toward what you want. But you have to approach it strategically, methodically, and with a feminine approach from the start. Much like contributing to your bank account, the balance of your feminine behavior builds over time and this is how a trusting partnership is built.","title":"What Working with Executive Men Has Taught Me About Submissiveness as a Strategy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1df9ewm\/what_working_with_executive_men_has_taught_me\/"}

But I can\u2019t help but notice my face is changing. Just taking on that overall tired matronly look and my eyes are a little baggy and I just don\u2019t look like myself anymore. \n\nIn all honesty I look forward to getting older and I enjoy every aspect of my life, marriage, family life, financial standing, good health (knock on wood) and running our business has been great. I feel like there are some real benefits to getting older that I can appreciate more than other stage in my life.\n\nBut watching my beauty being ripped away from me has been psychologically painful. As a young woman it was part of my identity for so long and now it\u2019s slipping away. It\u2019s been bittersweet because now I like being an average woman but it\u2019s like watching yourself \u201cdie\u201d and you\u2019re seeing your own mortality staring you in the face.\n\nHow have you\/do you deal with hitting the wall? Do you have the support of your older friends? Do you keep having plastic surgery to stave it off? Does it matter to you and\/or do you refuse to give in? Or do you just let nature take its course and understand this is a natural part of womanhood for better or for worse?\n\nThanks for reading and I look forward to any advice you can offer.","title":"Dealing with Hitting the Wall","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/j08e1u\/dealing_with_hitting_the_wall\/"}

Sometimes, however, I think we need a reminder of the most basic vetting parameters and lately, there's been a recurring theme here: The Man Who Won't Work.\n\nI understand that there are extenuating circumstances for unemployment, regardless of gender, and male-dominated fields can be particularly volatile, hence the typically higher rate of pay. In my part of the U.S., many men work in oil, which has its highs and lows and even its debilitating accidents. People get laid off, unfairly terminated, hurt on the job, and sometimes contracts just end. Some fields are seasonal, such as HVAC and construction. Perhaps, you've even made arrangements for your man to stay home and care for the children and household, while your higher earning career pays the bills. If that model works, wonderful... because he *is* contributing. Men in these circumstances are not the ones I'm referencing. End disclaimer.\n\nSome men just won't work and no amount of cheer leading or negotiating will change that, nor will acting the shrew. You can encourage and plead and cry and scream and still, you'll carry the financial burden of your household. This man exists. I know, because at 19, I married one and tried all of these things, until I divorced at 23, a less than ideal history in the dating market. The Man Who Won't Work, though, usually shows his own red and yellow flags. As much as it's your responsibility to vet for anything else, you must vet for this. These are generalizations, as are all dating guidelines, but here are some things to consider:\n\n**He's not financially stable yet.**\n\nFor the most part, if he's a good prospect, he should be financially stable *now*, not eventually. If you're younger and still in school,\u00a0his goals should be attainable and\u00a0provide a sustainable income when the time comes. He does not have to have a college degree or even be particularly intelligent, but you can tell in the way he *gets* his money, the way he *spends* his money, if this man is financially an adult.\n\n**His career aspirations are always vague or tentative.**\n\nIf\u00a0he's working part time at Game Stop, but\u00a0planning to go back to school... eventually... for something... you need to prepare for the possibility that this will never happen. If he's had four jobs since you started seeing each other eight months ago, it's a sign of self-sabotage, through showing up late, mouthing off to his boss\/coworkers, or generally\u00a0poor work ethic.\n\n**He's always the victim.**\n\nThere's always some tragic tale to explain why he can't work. He was fired because the boss wanted to hire his nephew instead. He didn't get the job, because his grandma was sick the day of the interview. He came down with strep the day he was supposed to start.\u00a0He has some kind of chronic illness that keeps him from working. The latter might even be true, but do you want to commit to it?\n\n**He's entitled.**\n\nHow *dare* his dad refuse to pay his way for the annual family vacation? His grandmother *told him* he could have her old car, but now she's changed her mind. His parents cosigned for his *brother,* why not him? His extenuating circumstances entitle *him,* but not others.\u00a0\n\n**He still lives \"at home.\"**\n\nAside from an ailing parent, medical\/law school, or the abnormality of living in an *insanely* expensive area, if you're looking for someone who wants to settle down, he should *not* live with his parents. *I* live at home. That's what home *is.* He lives in his parents' home.\n\nIt truly *is* tragic to choose between divorce and supporting a grown child, so the best approach is to vet well. Are there any other signs of The Man Who Won't Work?","title":"The Man Who Won't Work","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/a58ig2\/the_man_who_wont_work\/"}

I'm fairly new to the community so I might sound awkward and stuff, but I don't really have anyone to ask for advice about this.\n\nTo put it simply, my family is financially disadvantaged. My mother never got married to my biological father, and frankly speaking it was a pretty abusive relationship. Family court isn't help much either. I've made my way into really good schools, and am on my way to a well-ranked university (sorry, I love to humblebrag about this). Pre-tertiary education was severely discounted for me by the school, but even with financial assistance, we struggled financially. University is going to be the most expensive thing, and while school hasn't even begun, my mother has been making suggestions that make me very uncomfortable.\n\nMy mom works 2 jobs, at some points 3. I currently also have a part-time job (probably gonna find a different one because my boss is being very inconsistent). However, these few months she's been bringing up weirder jobs, asking me to work with \"old men\". She won't shut up about this, saying things like \"I know a guy. You just work at his place, let old pervs touch you a bit, talk to them, get them to buy you things. Anyways, this kind of socialising is a skill you need. You'll learn how to talk to men. I used to do it.\" And me, being frustrated with my mother can only think \"Yeah, this skill totally made you successful.\" She doesn't really tell me what exactly the job ***is***. She tries to make it sound like a hostess, but it sounds more like a sugar baby to me??? I've so far given her disgusted faces in response to this, and she just laughs at me. She comes home from work and starts nagging at me for not making enough money, telling me to find a job even though I already have one...but she's right that it isn't making a lot of money.\n\nI'm worried that my image of my mother just worsens as she makes these kind of remarks. It doesn't help me respect her, especially when she recently revealed she was \"around $10,000 in credit card debt\" and \"owe a moneylender $2000\". I don't know if she's pushing me to work these jobs because she's stressed about the interest rates for the money she owes, or if she's trying to financially help me with tuition fees\/dorm\/etc. I know she's in debt and borrowing money (maybe from shady places) for the sake of my education and future, and I'm trying to feel happy about it, but I simply can't find a way to now.\n\nI'm just wondering if there's anyone else here who's been\/is in a similar situation? Having attended such nice schools, all my friends are upper middle class at least, so I feel quite isolated about this. And, do you think I'm being petty for rejecting these job offers? I know I'm young and blahblahblah men are willing to pay decent money, but I am extremely strict about living by my principles, and frankly, do not feel safe working in such an industry. I'm also worried about what men would think of me when they know I work\/used to work this kind of job. I know the decision is mine in the end, but I would like some input.\n\nSorry if this is lengthy and messy, if I find a way to improve it I will. Thank you very much <3\n\n**TLDR:** My family is poor, my single mother is in debt, and I'm about to attend a really expensive university. She wants me to work some night-life job she thinks will pay better than my part-time job. I don't know if she's using this as an opportunity to repay the money she owes, or help me financially prepare for university. Should I do what she says and take up this new job?\n\n**EDIT:** I just want to give the biggest **THANK YOU** to anyone who has read, and even answered this post. Being a new member here, my question originally wasn't posted. I had been considering taking up this job for about a day, and I was ready to talk to my mom about the job, trying to build up the courage to catch her attention after she got home from work and what do I see??? The mods approved the post! I ***SWEAR*** it was the most perfect timing. God or Life or WHATEVER works in mysterious fucking ways.

A competent First Mate can be relied on to take on duties that the Captain is not in the best position to do. These are the tasks that women are best suited for, or duties that the Captain is unable or unwilling to do. If the First Mate performs her essential duties, then the ship will run smoothly and the relationship will be a peaceful and happy one.\n\nI have categorized the essential duties of the First Mate into 5 categories. They are:\n\n* Morale Officer\n* Reporting Ship Status\n* Carrying-out Assigned Duties\n* Supporting Your Captain\n* Ship Maintenance\n\n**Morale Officer**\n\nThe First Mate's main duty is to keep spirits on the ship high. This becomes especially important to keep in mind when there are sources of tension. Being the Morale Officer means you are the soft place to land.

This means we are always searching out the best man we can find to pair off with. RP will tell you that if you are in a room with your partner, you will still be looking around the room identifying the best man present, whether that is the man you are with or not. \n\nOut of this constant looking, comes the concept of \"monkey branching\". This is when you stay with your current partner until you have identified a new, better, mate to jump to. The break up can be clean or there can be a fuzzy line (ahem) where one relationship ends and the next begins. Whatever the situation, the monkey brancher secures a new relationship before she leaves the old one. \n\nRP men *haaaate* hypergamy and monkey branching. Of course they do, it isn't in their best interest and at best a man will view it as disloyalty, at worst we are dealing with out right cheating. From a RPW perspective it is another fuzzy line. \n\nIn my experience, wandering eyes do not occur when the relationship is solid. This is a \"drive\" that can be satisfied and put down for a long sleep. However, when the relationship is not solid, when there is something missing, it can pop back up again.\n\nWith that in mind and in the spirit of Laura Gottlieb, my message today is this: \n\nThere will always be *something* you do not get in a relationship. No one will check all the boxes or align with your hobbies 100%. Some men will have a long list of pros but still a short list of cons. Alternately, they will be everything you could possibly hope for but they are just missing this one thing. However it shakes out, your perfect man will never be perfect. \n\nSo when that hypergamy drive kicks in and before you decide to monkey branch to a new guy, you need to take a hard look at the new guy. He may be an outdoorsy type while your current man is allergic to nature. Before you make the jump, you better be very very sure that Mr. Outdoors is also Mr. Reliable, Mr. Solid in his Faith, Mr. Ambitious and whatever other qualities you are *leaving behind* when you monkey branch. If all you see is what you *don't have* and fail to acknowledge what you *do have* then you risk losing all the qualities in your current man while you seek out *that one thing* you are missing. \n\nWe say that the grass is greenest where you water it. Don't tear up the lawn and put down rocks just because you have a patch of weeds.","title":"Hypergamy, Wandering Eyes and Monkey Branching","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1ccv2rz\/hypergamy_wandering_eyes_and_monkey_branching\/"}

Shame is our fear of not being good enough. This could be in a lot of everyday things like our femininity and what it means to be a woman, how our body looks, age, social status among our peers, education or lack thereof, the number of people we've slept with, mental health, RMV\/SMV etc. Some of these expectations are placed on us by feminists\/patriarchy\/social media whatever you want to call it. You do need to be aware of these silent expectations being whispered into your ear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow there's nothing wrong with having \"standards\" but there's no use in bashing other people or yourself with it. It's not productive and it's not helping you or the people around you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you find yourself judging another woman for her choices in life, ask yourself why?\n\nIt's usually it's because this woman is \"triggering\" one of your deep unconscious insecurity you have about yourself.\n\n* Her n count is higher than mine\/She's not a virgin, what a slut\/ she rode the cock carousel who's going to marry her now.

I wish I could speak my mind sometimes. I wish I could dress the way I want.)*\n* ...\n\nI have exaggerated some of them but you get the idea.\n\nPeople use shame to change others or to protect themselves from confronting their own inner insecurities. And as we all know shaming people to change just doesn't work or bring any lasting change but It does damage your relationship with the other person permanently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\n**Why you should stop:** Because it's not good for you or for the people around you. When you stop shaming\/judging people your relationship with both the sexes improve. You're happier and more care-free and people will want to be around you.\n\n**How do I stop:** Give other women the benefit of doubt, empathize, put yourself in their shoes. I'll cover more in another post if people are interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince it wasn't clear before:\n\n1.

A person of worth who deserves to be cherished, loved, sustained and taken care of. This isn't objectively true. However, it is the way women view themselves and the way men view women. Women deserve to be treated well just for existing. Thus, women are human **beings**. \n\nWomen value emotional reality over objective reality, feelz over realz. Your feelings are 100% valid even if you're objectively wrong. Whereas men tend to evaluate the objective reality and tell you to stop feeling the way you do because you're being ridiculous, women tend to validate your feelings first even if you're being ridiculous from an objective standpoint. The premise behind that is - I exist, therefore my feelings are just as real as the reality of the world around me. \n\nWhen mommy is happy, everyone is happy and when a woman is in distress, everyone comes to her aid. Both men and women reinforce her sense of existence. \n\n**Female bonding desire** \n\nIf a woman is a full on something, what more can she need? The answer is - some of the male's nothingness. A core need of women is to pair and bond with a man. \n\nMen begin from a position of nothingness and need to achieve to become a something, women begin from a position of being a something and need a man to imbue them with a sense of nothingness. Female sexual desire includes being dominated by a strong male (hello fifty shades of gray, a best seller book!). Female relationship needs include men who are decisive and who can lead. Women date up, marry up and have sex up. One way to look at the common thread in all of this is - women need to feel smaller in the presence of their man. They need to feel more nothingness. \n\nThis feeling of nothingness before her man does not contradict the feeling that's at the core of her being - that of being a something. She will always see herself as an inherently valid something who wants to lose herself in the strong arms of the best man available. Thus, she wants a man who will cause her knees to turn to jelly, not a man who will actually turn her into an actual nothing through abuse and the like. Therefore, women are extremely picky with regards to men. Only the best men are up for consideration. \n\n\n**Gatekeepers of commitment**\n\nIt's therefore no wonder why men hold all the cards when it comes to commitment. If a man's worst fear is being a nobody, a woman's worst fear is being all alone. OTOH, unlike men whose default is to be sexually attracted to all women with the exception of those who turn him off, a women's default is to reject all men except for the ones who make the cut. This means that most men aren't even in the running, but if you're from the few who are, you decide on the degree of commitment. \n\nThis is as true once the relationship is well underway as it is true during that first day of commitment. While the man may feel like he committed to her forever, she certainly doesn't feel that way (just like he doesn't feel sexually desired forever). His commitment to her is something for which she needs constant reassurance. A woman will be plagued with self doubt that boils down to - am I still lovable today? And therefore - **will he still commit to me today?** When a man expresses his love and desire or makes her feel special, he signals his commitment to her. Just as he needs constant reaffirmation of his sexual desirability, so too does she need constant reaffirmation of her worthiness for commitment. \n\nThe problem is when expressing his love for her and commitment to her decrease her sexual attraction to him. This is like a self destructive autoimmune disease and will be discussed in a future post. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nThe natural state of the woman is to be a deserving someone, her fear is to be alone. What she craves is for some male nothingness to be instilled in her heart by the strong arms of a powerful man. She feels secure when her knees turn to jelly in his presence. She needs constant reassurance of his commitment.  \n\nUnfortunately, most men don't measure up. This part of female nature is cruel to men. Those who do measure up hold the keys to commitment. \n\nCheers! \n\n","title":"Back to the basics - men are the gatekeepers of commitment.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8epbgq\/back_to_the_basics_men_are_the_gatekeepers_of\/"}

I'd like to ask you for help or some advice. Feel free to delete it, if thismay be counted as off-topic. \n\nSo, I'm 28 years old now. I was a pretty girl, then ugly teenager and now I'm an average adult. Strange mix. I went from a popular and well-liked, one the boys had a crush on, to the one the same boys were bullying and calling ugly. \n\nI was never on a date, never in a relationship. No one ever showed a trace of interest in me. I don't remember when I have a chat with a guy that was not a coworker, my gay friend or some kind of worker for the last time. Strangers usually don't notice me in social situations. \n\nI don't think I'm hideously ugly. I'm not fat and even posted on r\/rateme once: got everything from 4 to 10, but most were strong 6s and 7s. I consider myself moderately attractive, am slim, dress femininely and take care of my skin and hair. I see a lot of women way uglier than me with husbands\/ boyfriends and babies. Yet my looks were never complimented, even by a friend or my mom. \n\nIt's not like I sat at home all the time. But when I attended Swedish language course, guided tours around my city, theatre or open lectures and other activities, I met only other women. And while we like to spend time together during the activity and maybe go for a beer or coffee afterwards, we didn't become friends to meet outside.\n\nI used to be an active member of youth groups in my church while in high school and university, but now I don't attend these anymore. I guess I'm afraid that \"post-university\" group would have *desperate spinsters* vibe. \n\nI'm rather witty around the people I know well, but  shy with the strangers. An acquaintance once told me that I have a sunny personality of a princess from an old Disney movie and that was the nicest thing anyone ever told me. \n\nI don't know what to do. I thought about starting online dating, but I'm afraid what kind of people I would met there. I think I'm a bit naive and idealistic and afraid to be taken advantage of there. \n\nI'm getting more petrified when reading TRP or other, similar fora (yeah, I know, great idea). I read again and again that I'm a failure, a leftover, that I've already lost my life. I see men who cannot shut up how I'm a seemingly perfect woman they're looking for, to be glossed over and ignored yet again. When I tried to share my perspective once, I was instantly called a liar and a few worse ones. \n\nI try to remain optimistic, but I cannot help but be angry that men used to bully me and effectively destroyed my self-confidence and now they (different ones, but still men) are all like \"You should do this and that when you were 21, now it's too late\"...\n\nI don't know what to do.

The more open-minded you can be in terms of your search criteria, the more success you will have. This is more than just changing the settings in your account-- you have to be open-minded and broaden the criteria you\u2019re holding onto in your soul.\n\nYou should think of your search criteria as \u2018first date disqualifiers\u2019. If you exclude something from your search criteria, you should be comfortable saying to yourself, \u2018If I met this kind of guy, I wouldn\u2019t even bother going on one single date with him.\u2019\n\nThat might sound harsh-- it **is** harsh-- but used correctly that\u2019s OK! If you want kids, why waste everybody's time going on a date with a perfectly lovely guy who will never want kids? It's OK to use that to narrow down your dating pool. This will keep you from chasing guys that you\u2019re fundamentally incompatible with.\n\nIt also keeps you from searching for frivolous things. 'If I met a man who wasn't taller than me, I wouldn't bother going on one single date with him.' 'If I met a man who was into any of that nerdy crap, I wouldn't even bother going on one single date with him.' Notice how petty and unreasonable those sound? These are NOT reasonable disqualifiers. **These are insignificant details that only matter when you\u2019re dreaming up a caricature, not when you\u2019re getting to know a real man.**\n\nWhen you\u2019re snuggled up on a cold winters\u2019 night, are you going to get any enjoyment out of getting out the measuring tape and double-checking that your man\u2019s still over 5\u2019 9\u201d? When your car won\u2019t start and it\u2019s 5 degrees out and you need to get to work, is he gonna whip out a youthful, boyish hairline to help you? If Idris Elba took you out bowling, dropped to one knee, and pleaded with you to become the mother of his child, are you really going to say, \u2018No, Idris. I\u2019m sorry, but you're really into RuneScape and you don\u2019t share my rapturous enthusiasm for Harry Potter\u2019? If not, then why are you holding your dating prospects up to these weird requirements?\n\nThat being said, it is true that the higher your own relationship value is, the more stringent you can be with your set of criteria. An overweight woman will have to be open to dating overweight men. A woman that already has kids from a previous relationship will have to be open to dating divorcees\/men with kids, whereas a younger woman does not.\n\nTake a good look at the criteria you\u2019ve been using-- not just the ones you explicitly built into your online profile, but the ones you're privately holding onto in your heart. Are any of them unnecessarily restrictive? **Could you be overlooking great men because you\u2019re expecting to be bowled over by how suave and debonair he comes across on a dating app?** Are you secretly, in your heart, expecting more from the men you date than you, yourself, can offer?\n\nMy personal list of first-date criteria was as follows:\n\n1. **Looking for a \u2018long-term\u2019 relationship** as defined by OKC\u2019s search engine.\n2. **Never married, no kids, but wants kids.**\n3. **No smoking, no drugs.**\n4. **Must have a skilled job** or imminent job prospects (like a man finishing his degree, etc.)\n5. **Must live within a one-hour drive.** My rationale was that it was unlikely that a sustainable non-LDR relationship would develop outside of this radius. However, this is one criteria that I could expand if I wasn\u2019t getting enough \u2018bites\u2019.\n\nChoose 3-7 solid \u2018First Date Disqualifiers\u2019. **Make a pact with yourself that if a man meets these criteria, and the opportunity presents itself, you will agree to at least go on ONE date with him.**\n\nResist the urge to quietly scroll past a guy or reject a first date for petty reasons such as not liking his hobbies, his job in finance sounding quotidian and unsexy, or his online banter not being the crispest around. You have established that he factually, objectively has potential. You have no idea what he\u2019s really like until you\u2019ve actually met the man in person.\n\n**It is your DUTY to your future self to get out there and meet these guys with potential!**\n\n# Chatting\n\nYour goal in this stage should be to quickly double-check whether meeting in person is warranted, and if so, to set a date in the immediate future to meet up.\n\n* **Feel free to begin the chat yourself.** At this stage, there is absolutely no need to wait for him to send the first message. Try to give him a little something to work with-- don't just say 'hey' and then hold it against him when he doesn't fire back some astonishing witticism.\n* **Try to keep on top of your messages.** Inconsistently checking the app, neglecting to respond to messages, and letting the conversation fizzle out with one-word replies all increase the likelihood that you will overlook someone incredible. If you start up a conversation with a great guy, and then quasi-ghost him because you're flakier than a fresh croissant, he\u2019ll quickly dismiss you and move on. Even if you don't feel like it that day, try to give it a shot.\n* **Do not fall into the trap of endless chatting.** For our purposes here at RPW, until you meet up in person, you haven\u2019t really MET them. What you\u2019re actually doing is pre-forming your concept of them, and in some cases building them up in your mind. The longer you do this, the more likely you are to be disappointed when you do meet them. Furthermore, the longer you wait, the more likely it becomes that your relationship will STAY online-only.\n\n\u2018But u\/zsadiist,\u201d the astute observer might protest. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading that generally I should let him pursue ME. How can I control how long we chat if I\u2019m not supposed to be the one setting up the date?\u201d\n\nWhen you have decided that the chatting has gone on long enough, and it\u2019s time to Alluringly and Femininely Piss or Get Off the Pot, you can put the ball firmly in his court with \u201cHey, let me know if you ever want to meet up sometime!\u201d You then free yourself from the obligation to continue the endless chatting. This statement is not a demand, but makes it clear that he can ask you out without being rejected. He is then free to WOW you by planning a fabulous date.\n\n# It\u2019s A Date!\n\n*Disclaimer: This post assumes you have a pretty decent grasp of RPW advice. All the standard advice applies. Don\u2019t sleep with the guy on the first date.*\n\nYour official RPW objective on the first date is to have fun.\n\n* **Channel your inner Goddess of Fun and Light** (see any of Laura Doyle\u2019s books, which are standard RPW reading, for more info on this topic). If you\u2019re focusing on whether you want a second date, whether this guy seems interested, or any other \u2018meta\u2019 considerations inside your head, you will not be able to fully engage with the date or the man. Furthermore, you will come across as anxious or distracted. You can scrutinize all of these details privately later.\n* **Be flexible.** Allow him to plan the date, but have a few ideas handy if he asks. This sets the precedent of allowing him to do things that delight you, rather than you calling the shots all the time (a desirable dynamic).\n* **A date that includes a quiet, absorbing activity for both of you to do**, so that conversation can naturally ebb and flow, might be preferable to a dinner date that creates pressure to fill silences. Consider mini-golf, Paint Nite, a drive-in movie theater, bowling, an outdoor flea market, or similar. Ideally there will be plenty of opportunity to talk, but no awkward pressure.\n* **You can kiss him** if the opportunity arises and you feel good doing it, but someone who is concentrating on having fun would never feel obligated to kiss a guy if she wasn\u2019t feeling it yet. Because that wouldn\u2019t be fun!\n\nWhen you get home, now is the time to debrief, unpack your feelings, and decide whether you want a second date or not. \n\n* **If you loved it**\\-- great! Text him and let him know that you had fun! That opens the door for him to ask you for a second date.\n* **If you hated it**\\-- good! It\u2019s over, you never have to see him again, and you did your duty to yourself by checking the guy out. You knocked out one of the dates that happened to be on the path to finding a great man. You are one step closer. Do some fun self-care activities and move on to the next guy.\n* **If you are somewhere in the middle**\\-- perhaps some more thought is required. First dates can be awkward. If it definitely wasn\u2019t love at first sight, but you had a pretty good time-- you don\u2019t have to, but I would encourage you to go on one or two more dates to see if you develop a little more chemistry. By the third date, you should have a better idea of what to do. If you still only feel lukewarm, this is probably a good indication you should move on.\n\n# Willy Wonka and Abundance Mentality\n\nAbundance mentality is a concept that you might see discussed in the men\u2019s subs rather more often than the women\u2019s. If it is only discussed in the context of dread game, it can strike a relationship-oriented woman as bitterly distasteful. However, it is highly relevant to the modern female online dater.\n\n**You need to realize that there is no \u2018one\u2019 perfect man that you\u2019re looking for.**\n\nThat might sound off-puttingly unromantic. But it\u2019s actually FABULOUS news. The truth is that there\u2019s many men in the world that you could build a beautiful life with, who have the potential to make you very happy. They only BECOME \u2018the one\u2019 when you build a life together. You only need to find ONE of these men.\n\nThere is no need to fear that you just missed the greatest opportunity you'll ever get when some OKC guy is slow to respond to that last text. There is no need to pedestalize one guy that\u2019s clearly just biding his time until his ex is available again. **The energy one might waste fretting over these guys should be invested in finding one that reciprocates.** It doesn\u2019t all ride on you finding one perfect needle in a haystack-- you just have to find ONE of Willy Wonka\u2019s several Golden Tickets.\n\nIf you obsess over the single chocolate bar in your hands, without ever unwrapping it or giving other chocolate bars the time of day, the probability is high that you are wasting your time. When you finally do unwrap it and it turns out to be a dud, you\u2019ll be disappointed. Similarly, you shouldn\u2019t spend endless energy stalking one guy\u2019s social media presence before you decide to meet him. There are tons of other men you should be checking out!\n\nIf you opened a chocolate bar and there\u2019s clearly no Golden Ticket-- If you\u2019ve been on dates with a man and he\u2019s not that interested, but you stubbornly chase him and demand his attention, you\u2019re still going to end up disappointed. He\u2019s not going to turn around and suddenly have that Golden Ticket.\n\nNone of these behaviors increase the likelihood of finding a great man.\n\nIf you open lots of chocolate bars by going on lots of first dates, each date you go on might be that one you\u2019ve been looking for! You might have an unexpectedly hilarious time that leads to a long relationship\u2026 which leads to marriage\u2026 But you\u2019ll never know from just browsing his online profile-- **you OWE it to yourself to actually open the chocolate bars and go on those dates!**","title":"Online Dating with Purpose Part 2: The Golden Ticket Idea","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ha5249\/online_dating_with_purpose_part_2_the_golden\/"}

We met through his mother: I moved to a brand new city for college at age 17, and his mother helped me get settled into a church there. We got married two years ago. We met each other one year before we got together, and we fell for each other slowly but surely.\n\nAbout six months into our marriage, his workplace laid off a large number of workers and he was among them. I decided to start picking up more hours at my job to sort of compensate for the financial blow (we had also just then purchased a new car with cash). He would be searching for another job, but unfortunately he hasn't had much luck.\n\nMy husband is also red pilled, and we have both decided that it is my job to do the housekeeping. While I am able to keep the house clean after work, I am often tired and do not have the energy to be there for him as emotional support. We also have not had sex in a month. I understand that he is going through a lot right now and I want to find a way to be there for him more.\n\nWe are not in a financial place where we can see the doctor or afford therapy. Has anyone been through a similar period? How have you overcame it? Would love to hear what you all have to say :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented. I apologize for the late replies, as I have been at work. It is not easy to come back and say this, but because so many of you took time out of your days to respond, it is only fair you are made aware of the situation. I decided to ask him if it was possible for him to do some of the housework, but he has refused. We had an argument, where, as many of you suspected, he feels upset that he no longer feels like the captain of this household. It got heated, and a few hurtful things were said. I have decided that perhaps it is best I take, first of all, a week off work. We have discussed that it is best if I do not be present in the house for that week. I am going to my dad's house while he sorts through his thoughts before we can decide what kind of action we would like to take going forward.\n\nEdit 2: Hello everyone, it has been two weeks since I made this post, and many things have changed. I have left him. We are separated and I am in the process of initiating a divorce. I have also began therapy and reduced my hours. I am still living with my dad, and he's been a great support at this time, insisting I get rest and reevaluate my state of mind. Thank you for your perspectives, and to my sisters, despite not sharing the same views, on other subreddits who have also offered some words.","title":"Am unable to satisfy my husband - looking for tips from women in similar situations","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ewxi61\/am_unable_to_satisfy_my_husband_looking_for_tips\/"}

We met when we were 22 and married at 24. We always talked about starting a family and so I thought he was family oriented. I ended up pregnant a year ago. He was happy about the idea of our first baby at first. But later on he said we can't keep it and can't afford it, and already set up an obgyn appointment for an abortion. I really didn't want to go through with it, but I felt helpless and was made to feel stupid for saying I wanted to have the baby. My whole experience at the obgyn was awful. The clinic my husband chose was Mandarin-Chinese speaking, with staff and customers who spoke little to no English. I'm not Chinese and don't speak a lick of Mandarin, so my husband did all the talking for me and the doctors payed little attention to me.\n\nI didn't forget it once it was all over. The opposite. I beat myself up for being a coward who failed to stand up for my child and myself. I find it hard to forgive my husband. He doesn't seem to have an ounce of guilt. He tried to \"comfort\" me by mentioning that his mother had THREE abortions and it's no big deal, bringing up the tired old \"it's a clump of cells\" baloney. When I try to picture myself with kids in the future, the first baby is always going to be in my mind and the thought that he\/she wasn't given the love the others are is heartbreaking. At this point I doubt my husband and I would ever be good parents.\n\nAfter searching online for coping with post-abortion depression, I came across a lot of information. I happened to stumble across \"red pill\". To be honest, this all sparked a quarter life crisis in me a month before my 27th birthday (which was also around the time the baby would've been due). I'm no longer a young lady. I just approached the last few years of my childbearing prime. It was the perfect time to start a family. There's so much toxicity in the air but I don't like the idea of being another divorce statistic. Aside from this mess, I truly felt my husband was special and my soulmate. In that case, is there some hope in working things out, yet on the other hand I feel foolish. I know his apathy to the situation is mostly based on ignorance from a society that says abortion is no big deal and just another simple \"choice\" like getting a haircut.

It's keeping your mouth shut that does the trick\".\n\n**The STFU Method**\n\nThe STFU Method ^TM is a handy way to create and keep peace in your daily life. More specifically it will enable you to have a more loving relationship with your SO. We would like to examine why, how and when it is applied while also dispelling the misconception that you are a doormat for doing so.\n\n*Why do I need to STFU?*\n\nThe art of listening is an invaluable skill that can be useful in all areas of your life. We listen to friends when they have trouble, kids when they want to show something off, our parents when they have some wisdom to share, and a variety of other times in our lives. How it is applied to your current romantic relationship is detrimental in the success\/failure of it. I\u2019m sure we can all agree that if you don\u2019t listen, you can never fully understand. This is exactly why we stress  on RPW to just STFU. \n\nWhile communicating your wants, needs, and feelings is important, listening is often *more* important in the health and welfare of your relationship. Understanding what is actually going on vs what you feel makes it easier to know what the next step is. Reflexively responding to situations is only good in fight or flight situations. In the beginning of learning how to listen, it is good to just take all the data presented and digest it before actually forming an opinion about it. Over time, you will find that you instinctively can discern the appropriate behaviors for specific situations without ever needing to voice anything. In the beginning however, it is important to just S T F U. Listen. Learn. Absorb. \n\nFor new relationships, it is easy to STFU. You want to know how the person acts, what they think, what they like, and you want to please them. This is great and wonderful. The trick is when you have been in a relationship and the honeymoon phase is over, how do you keep that ability to listen and desire to please going? You see this guy at his worst and you are expected to still take him seriously? *GASPS* Seriously though, complacency is the killer of romance. So how do you prevent this? By listening to your partner. When you listen to your partner you are actively working on your relationship. You cannot expect a relationship to survive with minimal effort on your part. It just won\u2019t happen. \n\n*How do I STFU*\n\nThis might seem like a no-brainer. Just close your mouth and all will be well. It can be a little bit trickier than that. STFU also means body language. Eye rolling is not you STFU\u2019ing. Gasping with exasperations is you not STFU\u2019ing. Pouting is you not STFU\u2019ing. \n\nSTFU is you actively and consciously removing yourself from a situation to better assess it. For those who are more practiced, it could very well be only keeping your mouth closed. However, for most of us self proclaimed strong willed bull headed women we may have to *smile* and *say \u201cok my love\u201d* and **walk away**. These three small actions can make a big difference in your communication style. \n\nThe first step I suggest is to smile. This is probably the hardest step because you want to rip someones head off when they say something you don\u2019t like but the more you do this the easier it\u2019ll become. Fake it til you make it! The first few times, your SO might look at you like *WTF is wrong with her?* but over time it\u2019ll just be a positive way to signal that you need some time to process the interaction you just had. You could give mean stank face but what is that going to accomplish? Who does that really hurt? You because you\u2019re the one going to be stuck with the wrinkles. LOL. So smile and breathe in.\n\nNext is to state something agreeable. \u201cYes, my love\u201d or \u201cok, honey\u201d both give a positive affirmation and also reminds your SO that you love them with a term of endearment. You acquiesce to the situation and you do so graciously. This is to preserve intimacy and the closeness of the relationship. When has being a bitch ever gotten you anywhere? Never!\n\nMost important step here. Walk away. Go do what was told to you or just go to the other room. You can let your hamster tire out away from your SO. **DO NOT GO BACK UNTIL YOUR HAMSTER IS PANTING IN THE CORNER ALMOST DEAD FROM RACING AROUND.** Take this time to process what just happened. What was said, how was it said, what did you feel, why did you feel that way, what was your SO trying to say. All of these things are your hamster at work. You can use this as an exercise in reigning it in and over time you should be doing this faster and faster. This is also the time when you realize if you ACTUALLY do have something to say to your SO. This is when you can actually tell whether you should bring up something because it was detrimental on his part to the relationship. However, if that is the case, you still want to do it with a calm, cool and relaxed demeanor so taking time away is always a good idea. \n\nThose are just my three steps. Most times, I just need to close my eyes and take a deep breath and can handle most situations. However, these three steps have always been fundamental in my growth. When a breathe isn\u2019t enough, I walk away. If you find that you are walking away alllll the time, then there may be deeper issues with yourself at hand and those should be examined too. \n\n*When do I STFU*\n\nWhile reading this, you may think that STFU only applies when your SO says something to you that hurts your feelings. However, this applies to a variety of feelings. Not just hurt ones. When you aren\u2019t getting your way, when you think you know better, when you want to control things, when you want to dominate things, when you want something done in a certain way, when you want something done now, when you don\u2019t want to do something now, when you want to hamster, when you don\u2019t want to have sex, when you feel bossed around, when things just aren\u2019t getting done and you want them done NOW!!!! Etc etc etc. \n\nBossing, nagging, whining, bitching, complaining, griping, mothering, smothering, gumbling, belly-aching are alllllll times when you need to STFU. At times these things can be masked as coming from a good place. A gentle reminder every 10 minutes to take out the trash. A little push in the right direction because he has no clue what he is doing. A honey-do list a mile long. Sound familiar? \n\nNow go and STFU! Please let me know if I forgot anything. \n\nedit- formatting double edit: i really need to proofread my stuffs\n","title":"The STFU Method","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/41qmvl\/the_stfu_method\/"}

I've been a lurker here for a long time and made this throwaway (as you know, participating in this sub gets you banned from certain other subs, including offmychest, which is ridiculous). \n\nTwo years ago, I was obese and didn't take care of myself. I had short hair which I had cut myself, I wore men's shoes on purpose, and I lived in an apartment which was truly filthy. There was nothing in the fridge, since I never cooked. I microwaved meals from the supermarket but the inside of the microwave was covered in goop. I would throw away pots instead of cleaning them on the rare occasion that I decided to heat something up on the stovetop. I would literally pour salt on moldy pots that I couldn't even be bothered to throw out, in an attempt to 'kill the mold'. That's how slovenly and gross I was. I never shaved any of my body hair. I did wear makeup and dress conservatively, but only because I was insecure and a frump. I drank, swore, and hated men. I was on \/r\/childfree and made fun of stay at home moms to my friends, who were basically the same as I was. I spent all my time studying and watching movies and porn.\n\nThe wakeup call was when I fell hard for this guy. Now, he was not a good partner by any means. He had a history of cheating, he was rude to women but they fell for him anyway, he had frequent hookups, refused to commit. Pretty much followed the seduction advice of RP but I don't think he subscribed to that ideology. But he wouldn't hook up with me. He instead saw me as one of the guys, not surprisingly since I pretty much looked like the unattractive 'fat friend' in buddy comedies, and would tell me in detail about his hookups, ask for advice etc. And I gave him what I thought was good advice, though it ate me up inside. One day I found the courage to tell him that I was attracted to him, but he rejected me. He didn't even take it seriously, it was like if a frog applied to college or something, just a ridiculous unnatural scenario.\n\nI cut him out of my life and embarked on a journey of self-improvement. I lost a lot of weight by calorie counting and admittedly obsessive exercise. I've not kept all of it off. I'm still a little chubby, and I'm working on it. But when I was at my skinniest, I decided to reclaim my femininity. I grew out my hair, changed my wardrobe, and deep cleaned my apartment. All this was very difficult and some days I would just lie in bed and cry. I went to a psychiatrist and got medicated for my depression and anxiety. \n\nThen I did something I'm not proud of - I rode the 'carousel' as people might say here. I was constantly on hookup and dating apps, and probably became some kind of nymphomaniac. I contracted chlamydia and allowed myself to be assaulted and abused. One day I slept with five different men, going from hookup to hookup. I considered myself a liberated 'slut'. But actually I was still doing all this just to vindicate myself to the aforementioned guy. And I would tell him about my adventures. This phase lasted about 3 months.\n\nBut I realized that this was not sustainable. So I went on some travels, leaving my phone off and journalling my thoughts. This was a two-month concentrated version of 'nun mode'. I travelled to a country known for its beaches, thinking I would continue my campaign of debauchery, but realized something else. The married women here were conservative. The men were traditionally 'macho' and protective. People celebrated children and marriage - I saw many wedding processions in the streets, a source of joy. Women wore skirts and generally covered themselves up. There were few tattoos. Hookup apps didn't seem to be widely used except by foreigners.\n\nAnd I realized that this, here, was the life I wanted. I returned home and started reading up on traditional femininity, which brought me here. I read Fascinating Womanhood and the Surrendered Wife even though I was single. I was intrigued by it all. And I stopped sleeping around gradually, and eventually got together with my husband.\n\nFrom the outset I was honest with him; in fact he'd been a friend during the last phase of my slut mode, so he knew all the grisly details. I had 'friend zoned' him and was telling him all kinds of embarrassing details about my hookups, infections, and sex life. But I think he saw the good in me and I saw the good in him. He is not a RP guy (in that he doesn't read any of the subs or the literature) but he is the living embodiment of what masculinity is. He is traditional, he wants to provide for us. He wants me to be a SAHM in the future. He is kind, and strong, and very articulate. He works in a traditionally high-powered career. He takes care of his body and his mind. \n\nFrom the outset I was clear with him that I was ashamed and regretful of my previous lifestyle. I told him that I had changed, and I wanted marriage. We didn't sleep together until we were exclusively dating, and we didn't move in together until we were engaged. I do all of the cooking and cleaning and household management, and he is free to focus on his career. He does not 'abuse' this power in any way. In fact, when I am ill or otherwise struggling, he has always been more than willing to help me, just as I have helped him professionally in my own way, e.g. by setting up a home office for him and helping him choose a work wardrobe. But the main thing is that I treat him just as the books say. He is the priority in my life. He is never late for dinner, it is his home, our home, so dinner is served when he wants it to be served. I try not to 'nag' him. Whenever he expresses a wish that can reasonably be fulfilled, I fulfill it. This includes what you might consider silly things, e.g. he wants the bed made a certain way. I do it, because it's worth taking the extra five minutes a day to keep my beloved happy. I have never turned him down for sex, because his demands are not unreasonable, and I genuinely enjoy it. If he wants to try something new in bed, I will try it at least once. \n\nAnd you know what? It's OK to make mistakes. I've realized that men don't hold us to as high as standard as we hold them. He doesn't get mad when I slip up and get emotional, or 'annoy' him about something that needs to be done. He understands my weaknesses. But he encourages me not to do it, because he knows I can be better.","title":"Got married at 22 thanks to RPW: a painfully honest sharing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/lzbnzc\/got_married_at_22_thanks_to_rpw_a_painfully\/"}

He is quoted to say: \n\n\u201cTo a great extent the level of any civilization is the level of its womanhood. When a man loves a woman, he has to become worthy of her. The higher her virtue, the more noble her character, the more devoted she is to truth, justice, goodness, the more a man has to aspire to be worthy of her. The history of civilization could actually be written in terms of the level of its women.\u201d\n\nI have been tossing this quote around in my mind for the past week or so, trying to make out what I think of it. My first instinct was agreement \u2013 then doubt \u2013 then cynicism \u2013 now, hope? \n\nIn the 21st century in this post-birth control world, the sexual marketplace has become seriously unhinged. Sex used to be rare and therefore valuable in the market. Since the invention of birth control and the Women\u2019s Sexual Liberation movement, it is no longer difficult to find an easy lay. Before this movement, the only men getting lucky were men deemed worthy of being someone\u2019s husband and father to their children. If that\u2019s the Man\u2019s Game, it would make sense that The Virtuous Woman would be a woman one might aspire to *deserve*, and that the virtue or lack thereof of women in any civilization might propel it forward or hold it back. But will men strive to deserve the virtuous women while swimming in an endless supply of porn and cheap tinder hook ups? Maybe the biological paradigm isn\u2019t as simple as Women Want Commitment\/Men Want Sex.\n\nI turn to my partner and his friend with dozens of disorganized questions. Why commit to a woman if it\u2019s way more work and less freedom than a life without them? Why does RPW think it takes beta traits to offer commitment and be a reliable partner? Is the true pursuit of masculinity only sex or does it go deeper than that? \n\nEven posts on TRP will report personal anecdotes of finding the life of plate spinning meaningless, and an increasing hatred and disgust of the women they bed so often. \n\nMaybe Mr. Sheen is right. Men strive to deserve virtuous women. Sex, yes, but also respect, adoration, and yes, even commitment, from a woman of virtue. Sex that isn\u2019t difficult to *earn* is, by definition, cheap. Men have been slaying dragons and fighting wars for the women they love, even with brothels down the street. And almost all the truly masculine and alpha men I know are dedicated and righteous husbands and fathers \u2013 or want to someday be. \n\nIf they find a woman worth it. \n\nBe virtuous. Be noble. Be devoted to truth, justice, goodness. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.","title":"Women of Virtue","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/dunv2q\/women_of_virtue\/"}

We started talking and he made a lot of viking jokes and all of them were actually funny! \n\nSo, after a week or so of talking we went out for drinks. I went by bike to the pub we were supposed to meet and he sat outside waiting for me... He was even uglier in real life but once we sat down and started talking everything changed.\n\nHe has such a magnetism to him, I don't think I've ever been so instantly attracted to a man. He has a vibe that screams \"Don't fuck with me\", he was sooooo fucking confident, so intens. Also he was very clear about what he wanted, a soft and caring girl to be the mother of his children. He actually asked me how I felt about having children in the next few years... Who even says that on the first date?!?!? \n\nI was just being my soft, receptive and slightly giggly self. Having fun, drinking my drink and at one point he leans forward, looks me straight in the eye, smirks and says he is going to tell me something shocking. I'm actually startled by this... He says he is going to kiss me at the end of the evening and there is still some time to run away if I don't want that to happen. Well... That made me a little warm on the inside to be completely honest.\n\nSo we kissed (which was great) at the end of the evening and I texted him when I was home. I told him I really liked spending time with him, he responded with asking if I also really liked him. I played it coy and said I liked him but wasn't sure if I really liked him. He responded that he was quite sure about that.\n\nThis guy... I swear to god... He really knows what he's doing. I went from being very neutral to doing a happy dance when he texts me. Now the challenge is making him work for it a little bit. He is ticking basically every box on my man wish list, except for physical stuff and I don't even give a shit about that with him! \n\nSo I would go out with everybody who seems slightly interesting on dating apps!

Soviet ideals, you know. But when it comes to relationships gender roles are essential: Girls have to look the best they can, it'll make them feel more confident and make her man proud to be with her. Guys have to demonstrate that they have what it takes to protect their families. Behavior that is gender-conforming isn't bad and no part is disadvantage.

I wait for guys to approach me but the only ones who do are sleazy immigrants (No offense, it's just the truth.) Meanwhile, all the good guys get taken away by girls who put no effort into their looks and watch soccer with them. They tell them what to do and they obey. It's a disgusting sight. They don't commit and think that this compensates that they behave like henpecked douchebags. I don't want to just go up to guys and basically tell them to be with me but it seems like this is the only way things work here. Also I hate how things are about sex here while commitment scares them away like it's AIDS or something.\n\nPhew, finally found a place where I can vent! I often feel like I'm the worst racist or whatever because I'm not celebrating this system where men aren't men anymore and everyone sleeps around. I just feel so lost and don't know how I can find a guy that can make me feel like a woman and support me like a real man without fear of things getting serious (because that's what I want).","title":"I don't understand how Western men work","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6nvade\/i_dont_understand_how_western_men_work\/"}

If you check out my prior posts, you\u2019ll see a little more of my journey and how RPW has been instrumental in my life over the last few years. \n\nI recently moved in with my boyfriend, we\u2019ve been together for almost a year and while it wasn\u2019t my plan to move in together before we were at least engaged, sometimes life happens and ignores your well-laid plans. I was ANXIOUS that moving in together would wreak havoc on our until-now-perfect relationship\u2026 we had never argued or had any major issues but a big step like this could be the time that past issues flare up, right? Add in my past relationship trauma and the extra stress of having roommates and I was clinging to the belief that what I\u2019ve learned from RPW would be my saving grace as we embarked on this journey together. Spoiler: it WAS! \n\nSomething about me that I think many of you will get: I can be a bit controlling - I get anxious, I like plans, and I like things to go \u201cas they should\u201d (according to me). So when I moved in with my boyfriend, I pretty much only brought my clothes and bathroom stuff since his house was already furnished and we plan to get our own place when the lease ends. I asked him where my things would go and he immediately planned to clean out his big dresser for me\u2026 awesome, right? But then he didn\u2019t do it immediately. So I waited a bit and brought it up again, asked when he might do it so I could fully unpack\u2026. he didn\u2019t seem especially excited to do it just then. \n\nPast me woke up a little and wanted to REACT - to scold him, tell him it made me feel like he didn\u2019t even *want* me to move in, cause a scene and blow this little issue into a huge ordeal. RPW me chose to have grace. He works nights, he\u2019s got some personal stuff going on, he probably had every intention of doing that for me but just couldn\u2019t do it that second. So instead of causing a scene, and instead of doing it myself which would have been just as problematic, I used my day off to deep clean the rest of the house and cook dinner for us. I spent the night hanging out with him, we watched a movie he wanted to see, we had sex\u2026 and the next day, while I was at work, what did he do?\n\nHE CLEANED OUT THE DRESSER. Not just that, he also cleared out half the space in the bathroom and bought new sheets for us to put on *our* bed together. No nagging, no fighting, no stress. I thanked him for it, unpacked, lit a candle\u2026 and he thanked me for my patience and told me how excited he was for us to be living together officially. \n\nWhat was a day or two of impatience on my part would once upon a time have become a full-blown ordeal\u2026 and now, it\u2019s just a reason to have some grace, practice STFU, and see what happens when my man feels loved, seen, and appreciated. :) \n\nBonus win: we are planning a trip to go visit my family so he can bond with my dad and ask him for his blessing to marry me. I am so grateful and so in love with this man.

I usually never post on this kind of personal stuff on the internet, but I'm over the moon these past days and had to share.\n\nBefore I stumbled across this sub, I began a relationship with a man who I have always loved deeply and respected. He is the most upright, responsible, and devoted man I have ever met, very high value, but I never had the tools to describe him exactly. In the beginning we had many problems and lots of fights. Cue a few years in and I felt so stuck. Both of us knew we loved each other so much, so we couldn't end it, but it also seemed like we were stuck in a cycle, where we would constantly make the same mistakes. I began to think we were fated to be stuck in a problematic relationship that couldn't grow more profound - actually, it is a lot like most of the relationships I see around me. (We all know those couples don't we? In relationships for years, but unable to move forward into the happy realm of marriage.)\n\nWell, enter stage this sub! While I don't agree with everything here, the relationship advice seemed to match us so well I couldn't ignore it. He is a masculine man in heart and character, and I am sometimes an emotional wreck with perfection and control issues lol. He would always accuse me of not trusting him and overriding his decisions and never having his back. He felt like I was always making everything else in my life a priority above him. How could I not, when every corner tells us that our self-care and career should be priority for the sad plights of historically abused and used Woman? All the advice I heard in person and online (not from RP) was telling me that as a woman, I held every trump card. I didn't have to address the issues he had with me or change for him - he should learn to deal with it. So why didn't it work for me? Why couldn't I make this high value man commit to me fully? I was always sad and so deeply confused.\n\nSince actively trying the advice from this sub (truly listening to his problems and concerns, stopping nagging (for god's sake), doing more for him and submitting to his decisions, retooling myself as a soft place for him to land, etc.) we are so much happier. I saw every effort I deliberately put out to him returned a thousand fold. I never wanted to do \"too much\" for him because the women around me would see that as weak and submissive, but it's not true guys. When I began doing sweet things for him and helping him deal with stresses of his life better, he began doing even more for me too. Pretty fairytale stuff folks :)\n\nIn an absolutely surprising gesture, he proposed to me a few nights ago!!! We have been dating for years, so of course we had talked about it, but it had always ended with him saying he didn't think I was ready for marriage, and he couldn't do it until he saw I was as committed to him as he was to me. Well, seems like I got good enough ladies, and so much thanks to this sub! LOL\n\nI'm more happy than I ever thought I could be about this. It's so fulfilling to find, develop, and keep the love of a wonderful man, despite what corporate media outlets want women to think.

Many writers consider it to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written, and Tolstoy himself called it his first true novel.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned several times that I love this book!!

But I find negative role models to be more compelling when I decide, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like that\u201d\n\nThere are male characters in this book who embody different aspects of RP men. Some of them are Red Pill or Blue Pill. Some of them are MGTOW. It\u2019s an interesting perspective to watch these characters both fail and succeed.\n\nThere are other female characters who embody RPW. Kitty grows a lot throughout the book.

He married a woman much younger than him, she's 29. While she's gorgeous and youthful, they fight. A LOT.

The husband was working in the morning and began packing in the afternoon.\n\nWife is out hanging with her girlfriend and returns home 1.5 hours before departure. She hasn't packed. Ensue big argument between the couple since she's acting like an irresponsible child when she's almost 30.

The key is not to let your functionality overrun the relationship (bossy, naggy). How can RPW maintain your childlike optimism while still being functional?\n\n1) **Childlike affection.** Ever seen a little girl hug a puppy, or kiss her parents? Or beg her daddy for a piggy back ride? Giggle when someone harmlessly teases her? She's open with her emotions, she's not afraid to show her love. She gives her affection to those that are dear to her.\n\n2) **Childlike enjoyment.** Think about a little girl eating ice cream, enjoying her favorite lasagna, putting on a pair of beautiful earrings, painting her nails, singing along to her favorite song. She's happy about the simple things in life. She's uninhibited with the pleasures of the world.\nAny good woman knows how to control her emotions - to switch from being functional to being childlike, and a talented RPW knows how to assess which situation requires which quality.

And how these are actually two manifestations of the same male desire for a passionate, involved partner.\n\nSo, it may not be hypocrisy, but it still leaves today's young woman with a problem. **She cannot simply treat men like slot machines where you pull the sex handle until you win the relationship jackpot**... because with each pull, her odds get worse. Entering into a series of sexual relationship, and simply hoping each one will be \"the one that works out\" is foolish.  \n\nEvery time a woman goes to bed with a man, she takes a risk, and makes an investment. Getting to lifelong, happy relationship, with the best possible man, is about managing this risk, and maximizing returns on her investment. \n\nSo, answering the question, \"What is there?\" leads to \"What shall we do about it?\"\n\n**The Final Exam**. \n\n*\"The moment after I first bedded a girl, that is when I would meet her for the first time.\"*\n\nThe man who once told me this knew what he was talking about... he had loved a lot of women, some for a single night, some for years, one until breast cancer finally took her in the twilight of both their lives. \n\nIt took me a while to understand what he was talking about, but I eventually did. When a young woman meets a man, she naturally asks herself *\"Is he serious about me, or does he simply desire my body?\"* What she often doesn't realize is that such is the power of the male sex drive that *often he doesn't know, himself*. \n\nSimply put, many men, in the first stages of getting to know a woman, are wearing **\"lust goggles\"**. Couple this with the fact that male emotions are dimmed down to the point that **many men are unaware of their emotional state** from moment to moment, and you get a man who simply **doesn't know what he wants yet**. He may say he wants a relationship. He may even believe it. He may try hard for weeks or months. But the true test is **how much emotional attachment remains when the \"horny goggles\" are off**. \n\nWhen sexual desire is out of the equation, whatever remains is emotional attachment. \n\nSo:\n\n* The first \"moment after\" is like getting your grade back on the final exam. \n* You are just now seeing the results of what you did up to this point. \n* He, too, is just now seeing the results. \n* If he's edging towards the door, or edging you towards the door, you failed. \n* If he's spooning and nuzzling, it's more likely you passed. \n\nNothing is finalized until those \"horny goggles\" come off, and promises or facebook statuses don't change this. Men do not leave you because they \"didn't pinkie swear\". Men leave you if they are unhappy with who you are, or what the deal is. \n\nSo, given that the goal is *the best possible relationship*, with *the best possible man*, lasting *indefinitely if possible*, then there are a few obvious implications of this metaphor. \n\n#1. Don't take tests if you don't care about the class.\n\nNever have sex with a man if you are not passionate about him, and specifically him. If you want an orgasm, get a vibrator. If you want attention, get a dog. If you are lonely, go hang out with friends. If you want to feel pretty, get a makeover. If you're not sure you're into him, and you want to test it and see, then you're not into him, and you should stop wasting his time. Any relationship that you do not enter into out of urgent desire for that specific man is a bad risk. \n\n#2. Don't take tests if you don't know the material and haven't studied. \n\nIf \"how to be a keeper\" is an abstract idea to you, if you don't really know what it means to \"be feminine\", if you find yourself *arguing with men* instead of *charming them*, then you are not relationship-ready, and you need to be in monk mode, working on that, before you gamble on your relationship readiness. \n\n#3. Don't take tests unless you are prepared to take responsibility for the results. \n\nIf you are focusing on \"searching for a commitment-minded man\", \"finding a trustworthy man\", or \"making sure he's not a player\", then you are shifting responsibility. Getting to sex is men's responsibility, but getting to relationship is yours. There's a reason why we think a college student who complains that \"the test was too hard\" is a lazy, irresponsible lout. \n\n#4. Don't take any class that you are not good enough to pass. \n\nCondemning men as \"players\" is shifting responsibility, but also be aware that any woman can have sex with a man that is out of her league for relationships. If you know your girl game isn't good enough to reel him in, let him swim past.... even though you know you could get him in bed. Some players are too good for you. Don't like that? Become better. \n\n#5. Be prepared to take the test when it's scheduled, or drop the class. \n\nThe purpose of a test is to assess your ability. If you tell the professor you need extra time to study, or you will fail, you are telling him you deserve to fail. If things are getting hot and heavy, and you have to put on the brakes and say \"not yet, I need you to commit to me more\", then he knows you're think you can't pass the test. You are telling him right up front your girl game isn't good enough, and that he won't *want* to stay without a binding promise in the mix. \n\n#6. Choose your university carefully. \n\nNightclub University gives tests on the first day of class. Maybe if your girl game is really tight, you can pass, but that's risky. Thirsty Beta University gives easy tests after a long class, but who the hell wants a degree from TBU? Fundamentalist Bible College doesn't give very hard tests at all, in fact, sometimes it gives you a passing grade *before* the test, but it only admits fundamentalists, and commits you to a career in the church. The Homewrecker School of Married Men lets you delay tests, but only a handful of women have ever successfully graduated, and they are not very popular. \n\nSome good schools include Social Circle State, which gives slightly more study time and degree programs are pre-vetted for prestige and career impact. And the Workplace Crown College uses a unique model of allowing students to observe classes for some time before declaring the intent to take them. Clever students will think of other examples. \n\n**Key Takeaway points:**    \n                          \n* Turning sex into a relationship is your responsibility, not his. \n\n* Relationships are only truly tested after sex has begun. \n\n* Putting men off when they think it's about time damages your prospects. (You are visibly not passionate about him.)\n\n* Prefer nexting men over delaying them. You are either all-in, or you're out. \n\n* Balance risks and rewards. \n\n* The venue you meet in a man in has a lot of impact. Choose wisely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","title":"The Final Exam","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4gfzqa\/the_final_exam\/"}

The community happily cites BMI and jumps down the throat of any woman claiming to be thin with an overweight BMI. This is good. No one is better off living with blinders. \n\nIt is very *common* for women, particularly woman in and around their 30s, to come in and say: \u201cI\u2019m 30-something but I really look 20-something\u201d. This is met with silence and it\u2019s time to take off the blinders. \n\nYes, some people age better than others. One of the typical RPW goals is to maximize your beauty both before and after you find a mate. There will always be a spectrum of attractiveness for any given age and your goal is to look as best you can for your age. Maybe this even means you are more attractive than *some* younger women. However, there will be younger women who are more attractive still and you might just be competing with them. \n\nAdditionally, by virtue of being younger, those women will look better for longer. They have a little more time ahead of them to find a man, their laugh lines and grey hairs are a little further away. Telling yourself that you are 33 but look 28 does not give you the time frame of a 28 year old. Nor will it put you on the radar of a high value 28 year old man. \n\nAnd the much bigger deal is the fertility time line associated with your age. It truly doesn\u2019t matter how good you look for your age. It gets harder to have kids as you get older. Even if it doesn\u2019t get harder to conceive, the risks increase with maternal (and paternal) age. The number of kids you can have in the available time span will shrink. Once again, looking younger does not give you the body and timeline of a younger woman. \n\nFinally, people around you are lying to you. Or, let\u2019s be charitable, maybe they are just bad at judging. Going back to the BMI comparison, the typical response to \u201cI\u2019m so fat\u201d is \u201cNo of course you aren\u2019t\u201d or \u201cthe right man will love you for you\u201d or any other number of feel good responses. Let\u2019s be honest with ourselves, what kind of person says: \u201cOh yeah\u2026you really do look old\u201d. Don\u2019t trust all the people around you who say that you look 10 years younger than you actually are. They are being nice. Nice doesn\u2019t help anyone. \n\nLadies, men aren\u2019t stupid (and if you find a stupid one, do you really want to marry him?). They understand these things. Unless you plan on lying about your age, the actual number is still the actual number. When you are assessing your value and what you bring to the table, don\u2019t leave your blinders on. \n","title":"Lies we tell ourselves: I don\u2019t look my age","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/b0f1nx\/lies_we_tell_ourselves_i_dont_look_my_age\/"}

I had found RP a few weeks before. I considered myself feminist. First, I was angry. Then I realized the more I read this sub, the more things made sense. I posted because I was worried about my marriage. I could not figure out how to get my husband to take the lead. I had been the type of woman who was proud to make more money than my husband. I would brag that my job was high pressure and that I didn't have time to do domestic things. He had settled for a terrible job that totally demoralized him and he lost all ambition to do better with me taking the role of the breadwinner. We stopped having sex. We would go out to eat and I would always pay because I'd tell him he couldn't afford to pay for dates. I fell into a mother role where I would constantly nag him. All he did was play video games. When I posted, the vast majority of the ladies who responded said I had basically ruined my marriage and that it was over. I was angry. I tried to forget about RPW.\n\nThen something amazing happened. My husband lost his job. In the past I had expressed that I thought if he lost his job, he would simply stay unemployed because he was so unambitious. But the moment he told me he lost his job, something clicked. This was our opportunity. I immediately told him that I couldn't wait to see how he would do in his next job, that this was great news and it was time for us to make a change anyway. I *didn't* suggest that I would support us on my salary alone(which I had always said in the past). The first few days were really hard. He had a hard time looking for a job. But I gently made suggestions and then pulled back, and eventually he came to me with ideas, thoughts on what his next steps were, etc. I was unequivocally supportive. I told him how smart and capable he was and that I knew he would be able to get any job he wanted. Every time he went to a job interview, I told him how proud I was and made sure to shower him with physical affection that I had withheld for so long. He works in a very in demand field, and within two to three weeks he had a job for double his previous salary. \n\nWe went out and he bought all new clothes -- dress shirts, nice pants, etc. His wardrobe had become basketball shorts and video game t-shirts prior to this. I started ironing his clothes for him before work. I felt the urge to complain, and I didn't. I would make sure he had food to take to work, which I \"didn't have time\" to do before because I was so busy with *my* job. Within two months, he had gotten a raise. He was excelling at his job, and his confidence was through the roof. I gave him all the support I could at home to make sure he only had to worry about his success, as he had lost many potential career advancement years while we were stuck in a rut.\n\nAnyway, this has been stressful at times but I had kind of naturally fallen into this better pattern and did not really think of RPW again until recently. I was passed over for a promotion, in favor of a male colleague. I was very hurt and upset. I worked harder than him. I'd been on the team longer than him. Then I stopped and thought, \"I have worked so hard, sometimes at the expense of neglecting my husband, and where has it gotten me?\" I pulled back from work. I stopped checking my email outside of work hours. I stopped being available for every emergency. \n\nI put more of my focus into my marriage and self improvement. I exercise almost every day. I dress better. I clean more often. I make sure we always have food prepared, I'm always trying new recipes and making sure his favorite foods are onhand. What prompted this post is that I found myself ironing our sheets before work today, and I felt happy. It was almost meditative. I had always enjoyed \"domestic\" activities before, but I felt ashamed of it and like I had to be a strong woman who could support herself and didn't have time for frivolous things. Here I am now, giddy at the thought of my husband coming home and seeing our bed made up with our new mattress, sheets, and pillows that I set up while he is at work. I can honestly say I have never in my adult life been happier.\n\nThese are some of the things that have happened:\n\n* Our sex life has improved immeasurably. I stopped treating him like he was a monster for wanting me. I would snap at him all the time before when he wanted sex. Now even if I am not in the mood, I am open to it. But I find myself in the mood MUCH more often anyway due to the improvement in our marriage.\n* He has expressed pride multiple times in the things I do for him. For example, he told me when people compliment his shirts he thinks about how I always make sure they are ironed and ready for him. I feel so happy when he tells me this. Knowing that the things I do for him are present throughout his day and make him think of me is very gratifying. There was no equivalent to this feeling before when I was the \"breadwinner.\"\n* He takes me out on dates. He's taken me shopping. I can enjoy these things guilt free without complaining that he can't afford it. It feels so good to get dressed up and be treated by my man. We hadn't done this since pretty much the first year we were dating. \n* I feel so much more attracted to him. He dresses nicely even on the weekends now. Basketball shorts are no longer regular attire. This also motivates me to dress more nicely. When we walk into a restaurant or a party, I feel a sense of pride and feel good about our image as a couple. I'm sorry if that sounds shallow. But I used to want to disapper, I felt bad about myself and about him.\n* I make time to exercise and take care of myself now. I'm running a 5k for the first time in a couple of weeks. I feel awesome! My husband tells me all the time how proud he is of me for sticking to my running routine.\n* We almost never fight anymore. This is the big one. Before we would fight almost every day, to the point that I started to avoid interacting with him. I was so lonely I would just lay in bed and cry, feeling like I was so far away from my husband and that we couldn't interact without being ugly towards each other.\n* With stress from the marriage gone, home has become a place where he can retreat from a stressful day. In the past, during really bad fights, he stated he didn't even want to come home because I just stressed him out. The difference is night and day. Now I am the place he retreats after a hard day.\n* Edited to add a major one I forgot: I had always said I was childfree. Now with the stress of overworking myself gone, and with our marriage being in such a better place for almost a year now, I actually feel open to having kids. We have already had talks about it and are planning our travel over the next year or two so we can get our pre-kids bucket list done and then get started. I actually... feel happy about the idea of being a mom, which was a totally foreign concept to me, but I feel even more excited to see my husband be a dad. When I see him with our niece I just picture our kids and how wonderful he would be with them.\n\nThere are other changes I'm sure I'm missing and this is already a little bit rambly, but just overall my marriage is amazing now. It's everything I wanted. And I know he is so much happier too, because he has said so more than once. I never would have thought this was possible, but it's like RPW planted the seed I needed to make these changes and I was able to undo years of nagging, abrasive interactions. When we disagree on something now(something that doesn't matter to our marriage, like our opinion on something political that doesn't affect us), I gracefully change the subject, where before I would hammer my opinions into his head. I would rather be happy with my husband than be right.\n\nAnyway, my reason for posting this is two-fold. First, as a thank you to this community for giving me the ideas that helped me steer my marriage in the right direction. Second, for any other feminists out there who lurk here and like me have molded their personalities to what we are so often pressured to be, which is essentially to act like a man. If you are having doubts, take some of the advice from this sub and apply it to your relationship. It can't hurt. You're not compromising yourself. You're not betraying other women. You're not being shallow. You are not a \"bad feminist.\" This was a big concern for me at first. But in the end, you have to do what is right for you. You can believe in equality and accept that things work better for you when you fall into a certain role. It's okay to reject the current wave of feminism that encourage promiscuity and having 1000 partners(I feel embarrassed when I think about fights I had with my husband because he was \"slut shaming\" someone, when he was just observing destructive behavior). It's okay to do things to help your marriage, and there is hope even in situations that are seemingly not salvageable... my marriage is proof of that.","title":"A thank you of sorts, or recovering from a \"feminist\" marriage","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/3imcyh\/a_thank_you_of_sorts_or_recovering_from_a\/"}

Happy reading!\n\n*****\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of amazing RPW theory on how to be Madonna, the wifey-material ideal, and also no shortage of RP theory warning you of the very real dangers of being The Whore. *Here at RPW, we often believe that **Whores Sin\/Madonnas Win.*** However, just like there are risks and pitfalls when we follow AF\/BB to a T, there are also risks and pitfalls to dichotomizing yourself into a Madonna and completely rejecting the Whore.

Let\u2019s do the same for Madonna and Whore traits\/behaviors. Knowing your strengths and weaknesses as a partner is the first step to improving yourself.\n\nA quick reminder: having 1 red flag doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re no longer a worthy mate, and having 1 green flag doesn\u2019t make you God\u2019s gift to mankind. However, if you notice that you\u2019re stacking up quite a few red flags, you\u2019d better work to add more green flags or do what you can to decrease those red flags. \n\n**Madonna Red Flags:**\n\n- is sexually frigid and prudish due to a sense of shame around sexuality (a sense of shame that, ironically, allowed her to remain so pure and chaste)\n\n- shows an excessively maternal and matriarchal attitude towards her partner\n\n- has an unexciting and excessively risk-adverse approach to life along with a nagging, monotonous personality\n\n- shows a lack of sexual desire and has an inclination towards strictly-vanilla duty sex (if any), making her partner feel undesired from her lack of passion\n\n- focuses all her attention on caring and providing for her children and spares little time or energy for her husband\/partner\n\n- looks-wise, resembles a [Plain Jane](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/11\/7a\/da\/117ada5acdf26248eb97947d673045e4.jpg) or has an otherwise unenticing appearance thanks to frumpy clothing\/grooming or an indifference to her physical appeal\n\n**Madonna Green Flags:**\n\n- has maintained her virginity or an otherwise notably low N-count\n\n- nurtures her husband and family with a feminine touch by providing a soft place to land and having incredible homemaking skills\n\n- has an innocent, pure, even childlike outlook on life\n\n- is extremely loyal to her partner and family\n\n- has a gentle vulnerability and softness about her that triggers her partner\u2019s protective instincts\n\n- devotes herself to live by virtuous values: truth, goodness, altruism, sincerity, modesty, and kindness\n\n**Whore Red Flags:**\n\n- has a very high N-count and\/or a transactional view of sex, intimacy, and relationships\n\n- was largely unable to \u201ckeep a man\u201d from her past sexual relationships, whether it was due to a misunderstanding of her own position as the gatekeeper of sex or because her disposition\/attitude\/behavior made her difficult to love and commit to\n\n- shows a tendency for disloyalty and infidelity thanks to her lack of impulse control\n\n- exhibits many risk-taking behaviors like excessive smoking\/drinking\/taking drugs, getting multiple tattoos, partying, wearing hyper-sexual clothing in public, and engaging in casual sex\n\n- has become jaded and bitter because of past traumas and painful relationships, making it difficult for her to truly submit or defer to her partner\n\n- unreliable and untrustworthy as a partner and mother because of her Dark Triad Traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) that manifest as Narcissistic, Antisocial, or Borderline Personality Disorder\n\n**Whore Green Flags:**\n\n- sexually passionate, open, and kinky with the man she loves, thanks to the lack of shame surrounding her sexuality\n\n- has an adventurous, exciting spirit and an easygoing attitude to life that makes her a joy to be around\n\n- embraces her sensuality (as in the enjoyment, expression, and pursuit of all sensory gratification, not just sex) and lives life in the moment\n\n- understands and utilizes the art of seduction, making her partner feel deeply desired and keeping her own romantic life rich and vibrant\n\n- encourages and supports her partner\u2019s wildest dreams - risks, consequences, and social image be damned\n\n- looks-wise, resembles a [Bombshell](https:\/\/images-cdn.9gag.com\/photo\/ag5zBrr_700b.jpg) or has an otherwise extremely enticing appearance thanks to very flattering clothing\/grooming and her continuous effort towards her physical appeal\n\n*****\n\n##The Madonna\/Whore Mix\n\nThe closest you can possibly get to achieving unicorn status is by having a relatively balanced mix of Madonna and Whore traits. If you have too much Madonna and not enough Whore, you might end up in a sexless and passionless relationship that drags its feet until its miserable end. If you have too much Whore and not enough Madonna, you might have an incredibly hard time finding LTRs with high quality men and you might find yourself used up with nothing to show for it. Balance is key here, but *more importantly* you should have a balance of the **good** Madonna and Whore traits, because imagine the trainwreck who\u2019s a balanced mix of the *bad* Madonna and Whore traits \ud83d\ude05 \n\n(I will concede that if you insist on picking one side, your odds are better with Madonna traits. I\u2019d say the hierarchy of female partners is this: Unicorn (just perfect in every way, but sadly doesn\u2019t exist) > Sexy Madonna \u2265 Virtuous Whore (I can see some making the case for why Sexy Madonna traits are better than Virtuous Whore traits, but if your Captain is high in openness and has a more \u201calternative\u201d lifestyle, he\u2019d probably like the Virtuous Whore just as much as the Sexy Madonna. Because there\u2019s some leeway here, I\u2019m gonna go with greater than OR equal to.) > True Madonna >> True Whore.)\n\n**TLDR:** So just as our ideal Captain is the Soft Alpha\/Greater Beta, the best version of ourselves is the Sexy Madonna\/Virtuous Whore. Since this is commitment girl-game, we\u2019re working at a disadvantage because men are the gatekeepers of commitment. Knowing this, you have to WORK to become the best woman you can be. The first step of a well-thought-out self-improvement plan based on our knowledge of the male dual mating strategy is to understand what exactly we are striving to achieve. Only then can you begin to take steps in the right direction.\n\n*****\n\nA LOT of credit is due here. [That](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4yrobj\/vetting_a_man_part_3_alpha_and_beta_traits\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) alpha\/beta mix post was a HUGE inspiration for this theory, and it also provided the framework and structure for my post as well. \n\nA lot of the evolutionary mating theory from Part 1 came from [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheRedPill\/comments\/dxoqdl\/giant_heads\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) post by u\/Whisper, as well as from the works and theories of evolutionary biologists like Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying, and evolutionary psychologists like Gad Saad. Definitely check them all out if you\u2019re an evo-psych geek like me!\n\nI also found inspiration from [this TRP post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheRedPill\/comments\/o9pweb\/on_madonnawhore_complexes\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about the Madonna-Whore Complex by u\/Protocol_Apollo (warning: if you find TRP material unpalatable, maybe skip this post). I really liked it and started to think about how I could reframe it and adjust it for an RPW perspective that prioritizes commitment, not just sex like TRP does. I also wanted to delve a bit deeper on why a True Madonna strategy has some risks and pitfalls for women that the RP sphere side hasn\u2019t quite covered yet.\n\n*****\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n^1: There are a few Madonna\/Whore traits that we can\u2019t just adopt or abandon. N-count is the big one, but others include any questionable behavior or activity *from our past.* Men are human doings while women are human beings. While we get to reap the benefits of *being* born inherently valued and cherished thanks to our gender, our value is also more dependent on the things we did in the past that we no longer have control over. While these things undoubtably contribute to our Madonna\/Whore traits, it\u2019s better to acknowledge our weaknesses and learn how to compensate than to give up because we think we bear some kind of scarlet letter. Focus more on adopting\/abandoning what you CAN control in light of what you can\u2019t.","title":"The Male Dual Mating Strategy: Calibrating a Self-Improvement Strategy for Women [Part 2]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pqcp3s\/the_male_dual_mating_strategy_calibrating_a\/"}

I thought the post was brilliant, and I made it my goal to try it out within the next month! I've been talking to strangers (men and women) left and right to basically take away the approach anxiety I had when it came to talking to strangers, particularly attractive men. It worked!\n\nThere was a guy next to me in the elevator and I started a conversation about the weather. I know, real clever stuff - but I'd rather that than an awkward silence for 8 floors! But that was all it took for him to turn to me with a bright look on his face and start an actual convo. I didn't really check him out when I started talking to him, but once we stopped outside of the building to talk a bit more, I was taken aback by how attractive he actually was. We only talked for a few minutes since I had to be somewhere else on campus, but I was shocked at the way he looked at me. I couldn't believe he was giving me flirty eyes, since he was way cuter than most guys I've dated! He initiated a physical (but innocent!) IOI and I told him that I'll see him around. I should've hinted at staying in contact, but baby steps, lol! I could definitely feel some tension in the air, in a good way.\n\nBefore, I could barely make eye contact with men even when they talked to me first. Then I would question why I couldn't get anyone interested in me even though I thought I was reasonably attractive. I thought maybe I actually have a low SMV; maybe I smelled funny; maybe there was just a negative energy about me. After today, it was clear that it really is all about the way you carry yourself and how you put yourself out there. The lame excuse to talk to him probably let him know I was interested without looking too forward, which was the one thing I struggled to show to the men around me in the past. I'm happy that I'm finally putting these RPW theories to the test and seeing them come true right before my eyes!\n\nOn a side note, I also wanted to mention how BP media continually laments things like \"mindless\" small talk about the weather and the minutia of daily life. That's what made me hesitant till now to try the bad excuse - I didn't want to seem boring. Thank God I got over that! Sure, it's a bit shallow to talk about the weather but it puts your foot in the door so that you could have the opportunity to meet someone new and eventually talk about the things that do matter.\n\nEdit: link to the bad excuse post if anyone else wants it!","title":"Field Report: I tried using the Bad Excuse!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9ax5kj\/field_report_i_tried_using_the_bad_excuse\/"}

I already see the occasional post where women are fretting over the lengths they need to go to in order to perfect themselves, and I just want to remind everyone that the expectation has never been that you are perfect!\n\nMen do not love us because we are perfect, they do not love us because we're the best cook in the world, the best at decorating the house, or the best at anything. You do not have to measure yourself against those glossy magazine spreads of beautifully decorated houses and complex, fancy dinner spreads.  Self-improvement is not about being perfect or living up to standards that are honestly unrealistic for most people, it's about being the best you that you can be.\n\n1. You are not better or worse at cooking because you get stressed out at long, complex, \"fancy\" recipes. No one will love you less because you decided to buy store-bought pie dough, or you stuck to easier recipes. If you love cooking and enjoy those masterchef recipes, then by all means go right ahead, but don't feel like you're not doing good enough if that's not for you.\n2. You do not have to color coordinate your house with this season's most fashionable decorations. If you aren't very crafty and you can never get your centerpiece to look quite right, or you skip the centerpiece altogether that's perfectly fine. \n3. You do not have to run yourself to the bone trying to get everything \"perfect\". No one is going to notice if you don't make custom soaps for the guest bathroom, or if you have cute, individually packaged hot chocolates laid out decoratively next to the coffee maker.\n\nYour family and your SO like you for who you are, just as much as they appreciate you for what you do. You do not have to run yourself into the ground fretting about details, and you don't have to compare yourself to pictures from people who PAID someone else to style their house for them. All most men care about is a warm meal, clean house, and a loving woman waiting for them. Don't let the cooking, cleaning, and decorating become so much that you can't enjoy the time with your family or give them the best of you! There is nothing wrong with doing things simply and quickly so that you can spend your time with your family rather than stressed out over a turkey recipe that requires basting every 15 minutes and whether or not your homemade rolls have risen enough or if your decorations are classy and pretty enough.

I wanted to address that here, and discuss a little bit about our direction.\n\nFirst, I'd like to let everybody know, they left on their own accord, we didn't force anybody out. Second, I'd like to say that the sub will benefit greatly from this move. \n\nThere are a lot of rumors going around as to why the mods left, and I wanted to clear that up so there's no confusion.\n\nUltimately it was a disagreement between them and me. \n\nWhen I founded this sub, I founded it on one of the main principles that guide every subreddit in the red pill network: Value truth above all else. There was even a small image in the corner that said \"It is better to be slapped with the truth than kissed by a lie.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the old mod team were not living up to this standard. Rather than embrace truth and encourage open discussion that has make the red pill network subs as popular and successful as they are, they decided that a small clique of women had the one and only strategy to happiness, and anybody who disagreed with them should be banned. That includes a lot of very good contributors, and women who had simply come here for help and understanding.\n\nAnd by clique, I really mean it. Watching behind the scenes, it played out like the movie Mean Girls. The discussions that took place between myself and the mod team were less about facing hard truths, and instead about who was on who's side and who said what to whom. It was a cat fight. \n\nMy original intention was not to disrupt the flow of this subreddit. I never disagreed with the clique on their strategy of marriage. It's a great goal to aspire towards for women. That said, there were some questions about the changing sexual landscape that were being censored. When honest discussion from a red pill perspective is being censored, that's when we knew we had trouble on our hands.\n\nI did my best to appeal to the mod team, but at the end it didn't matter. They did not want to work with me towards the very goals this subreddit was founded upon, and it is my responsibility to the subscribers here to ensure that those principles stay in place.\n\nEverything I feared in my introduction post ended up coming true:\n\n>The problem I've seen with female-based sexual strategy forums is that they inevitably focus on what's politically correct. They focus on tempering the message so as not to offend. Because ladies, like it or not, our entire culture currently revolves around not offending you. Seriously. That's today's culture.\nThis forum will embarce truth first and foremost, sensitivity be damned. While I encourage people to remain positive towards each other, plain insults are discouraged, I understand that sometimes the truth will seem like an insult.\n\n\n\n**What's Not Changing**\n\nWe're not starting up a Red Pill men explain sub here, this is a sub for women and female sexual strategy. The moderation policy will always be focused on positive female sexual strategy.\n\nThe accusation that we want to encourage a \"plate school\" is nonsense. Men who come to push their agendas (to benefit themselves) will still find themselves kicked out.\n\nPer my original announcement:\n\n>RedPillWomen is not the place for men to show up and spout nonsense. We have an unofficial rule on \/r\/theredpill that basically amounts to: don't listen to women about sexual strategy. It's not that we don't like women, it's that women really have a hard time seeing past what they like to understand men have a different palate. The same goes for men, perhaps even worse so. Men, being the less discriminating gender, are more-or-less programmed to find women sexy.. no matter what. And when a woman says, \"I like to eat pie with my fingers\" you'll have sex-thirsty guys line up out the door willing to say anything for female validation. \"I love women who eat with their fingers.\"\n\n**The goals**\n\nOur goals will be identical to [my announcement post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1giney\/welcome_to_red_pill_women\/) when we started. Finding long-term sexual strategies to maximize one's happiness and success. This hasn't changed. \n\n>We had a radical idea- what if men and women learned about their natures and took proactive control of them, came up with a compromise that made both parties happier in the long run?\n\n>We're a cooperative species, and great things can be achieved when we do. Women, you have the ability to find happiness when you embrace the reality of your biological urges and impulses. You have the ability and the requirement to become the optimal mate for your optimal mate. Do not believe the hype that you are good enough how you are, and realize that in life, the only things worth having take work. That's for men and women.\n\n>RedPillWomen is self-improvement and long-term goal setting to maximize your personal happiness.\n\nI'm saddened that things had to play out the way they did, but my responsibility remains to you, the subscribers. I apologize for letting you down, and we will not allow this same culture to take over again.\n\n**For the next week**\n\nWe will be working on reinstating the sidebar and stylesheets, as the old team saw fit to try to destroy anything they could on their way out, claiming that it was \"theirs\" rather than the community's. \n\nWe have a few RPW members who have stepped up and are committed to maintaining this vision. We are vetting the members now for the mod team. \n\nAnd discussion will continue, business as usual. \n\nThank you.","title":"The Direction of RPW.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4db4ei\/the_direction_of_rpw\/"}

My best friend in particular is very much the center of the group and her wonderful relationship with her husband and personal rags-to-riches success are honestly very inspiring. Yet, over the past couple years quite a few of our unmarried female friends have been getting engaged, and pushing for marriages with men that they've only just met here are the most concerning issues I've seen when pushing for marriage without an understanding of RPW strategy:  \n\n\n1. No proper vetting process. If marriage is important to you, then you would never rush a relationship so much that you would skip this step. \n2. Showing your SO engagement rings and wedding \"inspo\" you like within the first several weeks. There is NO reason to try and take a relationship from first date to engagement in 2 weeks or less.\n3. Overlooking red flags. Even in vetted relationships, sometimes red flags may not crop up until later down the line. If your partner has started heavy drug use after proposing, when they were clean before, do not ignore it just because you've put a deposit down on a venue.\n4. Do not get married for benefits. Benefits should only be icing on the cake. This is not to say don't ensure they're stable, but you should be stable yourself before seeking marriage.\n5. All of your extra money is being spent on the wedding. If you and your fiance do not have enough capital to handle emergencies because of the wedding planning, then how do you expect your finances to go in the future? \n6. Being concerned about how photogenic the wedding party is. This is a day for you to celebrate coming together for life, not just to get Instagram material.\n7. It is almost always okay to slow things down. It doesn't matter if you're 18 or 48, do not ignore problems that come up before marriage simply because of the pressure of planning the wedding or because it might be socially embarrassing to put a hold on things. At the end of the day, this is a decision of a lifetime, whereas the wedding is just one day.\n\nIt is important to understand that the \"model\" relationships around you are the result of hard work, and our priorities were the marriage not the wedding. A wedding was important to me because I wanted to be able to have my 92 yo grandfather and the entire family there, but it could have been at the courthouse or someone's house. It was not for beautiful pictures, or a dress, or to play princess for a day. At the end of the day, if you wouldn't consider marrying someone without all the fancy stuff, then you should re-evaluate if you're in the right relationship.  \n\n\nWhat are some red-flags you ladies have witnessed when it comes to people desperate for a wedding?","title":"Date for Marriage, Not the Wedding","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/hgp5qh\/date_for_marriage_not_the_wedding\/"}

It was a small incident but the reactions of both of us has played on my mind since. I immediately went to find what he needed to resolve the situation as well ensuring the safety and comfort our child and pets out of the space efficiently. This means that my husband could sort the problem out without worrying about everything else. My husband dealt with the incident in the kitchen with a level of cool headedness that I greatly admire in him. He is very logical and always fantastic in moments of crisis. Afterwards we laughed off the stress of the situation and both commented on how well we worked together, and how disastrously it would have gone had we not fallen into those roles. Had I been trying to sort the potential fire out, I\u2019d have been a total mess. I\u2019m not good in that kind of stress. And if he\u2019d been rounding everyone up, he\u2019d have been worrying about me, whether I was able to sort it or not etc. In that time of crisis we leapt into clearly defined roles and worked efficiently together. \n\n\nAfterwards, I kept thinking about it and about the gender differences that often we choose not to accept or actively try to override. I also thought about a university lecturer who told me he was fearful of lecturing about sex differences any more because of reactions from students in the face of peer reviewed psychological research. Despite the current societal mood towards equality regardless of cost to mental or emotional wellbeing, I began to wonder what it would be like if I leaned into those differences. So far, it feels less stressful and more satisfying. I\u2019m a great second in command. That\u2019s where I thrive, and that\u2019s where my family thrives from me being most. It was always the position I enjoyed most when I worked too - so long as I respected my manager and felt like they valued me. I have no issue with others who wish to live and love in other ways. But for me, reverting back to more traditional roles felt like the right choice for our happiness and peace of mind. \n\n\nThe idea of submission is weird to get your head around, but I think the key points are that you would only do this with someone you greatly respect and trust, it\u2019s not something you just switch on either. It takes time and it\u2019s practiced through small increments. My husband steers our family in the right direction and I trust him implicitly in that. But I also know that he deeply values my opinion and experience, so if I raised an objection, then he would listen and take it into account. Maybe he\u2019d act on it, maybe he wouldn\u2019t, but I know he would listen and take it into account when he made a decision. My husband cares and protects us fiercely and would do almost anything to make me happy, so I am always mindful of how and when I might choose to raise concern, or express my wants or desires. I would never want to take advantage of him or reach a point where he is looking only to me to decide on what to do next. Our relationship feels stronger and much more satisfying since I\u2019ve allowed him to lead and stopped trying to take over all the time. Both of us appear to be less stressed as well, since we have clear areas to focus on, meaning that relationship,\nhome, family and work all feel much more harmonious and enjoyable.","title":"Experience: Traditional roles in household emergency","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/f37yii\/experience_traditional_roles_in_household\/"}

In short, my husband was in a very serious car accident, out of work for almost a year, severely depressed and suicidal, injured, in pain all the time, you name it. It was probably the  worst time in my life, in his, and in our time together as a couple. Thanks be to God and to his incredible doctors, counselors, PTs, SLPs etc he has since made an almost complete recovery and he is doing much better today. \n\nIt made me come face to face with reaaaaaaally painful memories but also, memories of healing, physically and emotionally. Memories of seeing tiny improvements in my husband\u2019s well being and health. I remembered our long, emotional conversations and also entire days of silence because my husband was too upset to speak. I remember feeling like the weeks filled with appointments would never end, but they were so necessary at the time and they did eventually dwindle down. Most importantly, it made me reflect on how far we\u2019ve come since then and what we fought our way through together.  We felt like we\u2019d be in a hole forever and that giving up was inevitable, but we worked our asses off and got through it. I felt so filled with gratitude and pride knowing that  we not only survived those hard times but also it made our bond stronger and encouraged us to grow. While it was an awful time in our lives, it taught us so much and made us strive to be better versions of ourselves.\n\nAt the same time, this whole situation got me thinking about how often I genuinely reflect - on my self, on my marriage, past experiences, family life, life in general - and I realized that while I recognize how important it is, I do not do it nearly enough. Because.. you know.. life moves fast, we\u2019ve got kids, friends, jobs, activities, all of the things, all day everyday. The physical and mental exhaustion is a lot. My tiny roommates are constantly hollering or dumping containers of wooden objects or running around, and I get distracted. But I think we all owe it to ourselves to reflect more and take a good look at how far we\u2019ve come.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re going through it right now with your bf\/fianc\u00e9\/husband, my advice would be to simply remain by his side throughout whatever you\u2019re facing. Choose to love him intentionally - I hate the overuse of the word intentional these days but its fitting here. Choose to be his biggest supporter. Choose to be affectionate, kind, and patient - it will be hard and will feel impossible at times but it is so worth it. (Obviously none of this applies to situations where any form of abuse is present but rather uncontrollable hardships in life)","title":"If you and your man are going through hard times, there is hope- just remember to choose him and choose love.

Our instincts differ sharply, fundamentally, biologically. When I am faced with disappointment, betrayal, loss, failure, or frustration, I might shed a few tears, retreat to the embrace of those who love me, or process through meditation or other self care practices. We all have unique methods of handling difficult times, and while many of us may feel angry and upset at times, I have found that some women find an angry man unsettling and want them, especially those we love, to process more like women. But it\u2019s disrespectful, and unreasonable, to expect men to behave like women during times of stress.\n\nPart of my own personal development toward becoming the best partner and woman I can be has been to try to gain a deeper understanding and respect for my man when he is upset. I have begun to realize the immense responsibility that men carry every day that women, even in the modern era, do not have to bear on their shoulders. The men in our lives are fundamentally responsible for their own survival and wellbeing, as well as ours; they have been for thousands of years. This drive resides deep within their DNA. And while I have set out to have my own career as a nurse, I know that no matter how bad things get, he will take care of me.\n\nAnger can manifest itself in destructive ways, which has significant consequences to society: war, homicide, mass shootings, and dangerous ideologies. But anger also can manifest itself in productive ways. The world was built on the backs of angry men \u2013 men who have seen the world, and set out to make it a better place. Men facing stress, frustration, and oppression have brought their families thousands of miles through treacherous oceans, plains, mountain ranges, in search of freedom and a better life. They have built homesteads, communities, and nations. They have died for causes they believed in, for the preservation of society, for the safety of their families. \n\nAnd although in the modern era, our men are not pioneers and nation builders, they are each fighting their own battle. And when they experience conflict, whether a threat to their livelihood, community, or wellbeing, let them be angry. Because the opposite of anger is complacency. And a complacent man is weak, ineffectual, and a passive subject to a broken world. An angry man is a dangerous man, and only a dangerous man can keep my family safe. He has agency, he has ambition, he has drive. Give him something to fight for, not against. Respect productive anger. Let Men be Men. Or one day, there might not be any of them left.\n\nAddendum: I of course am not referring to childlike temper tantrums, or manipulators, bullies, and abusers \u2013 that is weakness. I\u2019m talking about men of strength, resolve, and passion. This should be obvious. \n\nHave a lovely Sunday.","title":"Angry Men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/bd48sk\/angry_men\/"}

I know without the support of this forum this would never have happened.  \n\nI began reading RPW about 2 years ago, at that time I was a wreck emotionally because I was a feminist and surprisingly no men took interest in me. Also, I had very few skills and interests, which left me unfulfilled. I found this forum and despite it being the epitome of what I resented in terms of women's roles and such, I knew something had to change so despite hating half of the harsh truths I saw here, I decided to follow the advice. I was 40lbs overweight, had a terrible wardrobe, and had a dyed very short ugly haircut.  \n\nI was told first to lose the excess weight and I began to really find a degree of happiness and fulfillment from exercising. I started lifting weights and running and over time the flab at my butt and belly dissapeared and became more toned which made me really proud. Instead of being somewhat self loathing I really began to have a degree of self contentment, and exercise is something which to this day makes me very happy and keeps me feeling healthy.  \n \n\nI then had to get a better wardrobe. When I say bad wardrobe, I'm talking basketball shorts, lots of baggy jeans, basically terrible terrible fashion. I bought a new wardrobe mostly comprised of dresses, skirts, some nice blouses, and the few pants I got were more elegant\/slender pants and yoga pants for being home alone in winter (I'm from Chicago and its very cold here). The clothes I got admittedly weren't great brands but they looked decent and were what I could afford at the time. Needless to say they were a massive improvement.  \n\nAnd then came the hair...the hair was the last to do. I had blue dyed hair, which at the time I thought was very \"individual\". Needless to say I looked like a trainwreck. I viewed short hair as a kind of rebellion against society to some degree, but I just let my hair grow longer and longer into a more feminine length. Finally I went to a haircut place and got that blue mess sheared off. I thought I was fairly good looking at that point so I started going on online dates.  \n\nMost of them were pretty uncomfortable, I didn't really like the guys. They seemed like 'beta' guys as you ladies say. Then I met this guy, my current fiance who really blew me away. He was nice dressed, handsome. He also initiated the conversation, and I got a lot of subtle clues he was pretty masculine. For example he asked me what I wanted and then when the waiter came over he ordered for me and said 'she's having blah blah blah\", which really caught my notice. He paid for the meal and held the door for me and took me on a walk afterward. When we were walking he put his hand on my back and kind of guided me it was so sweet, the whole date was  really romantic and I fell for him. We'd been dating since then and going on outings together. Anyway, yesterday he proposed to me and of course I accepted. I could never have even caught his eye without your help, much less married him. A million thank yous to you lovely oppressive women","title":"Thank you RPW.

This started to become a journey to improve myself in every area of my life. Being a great wife is just a small facet of being a woman. We are mothers, sisters, daughters, friends, coworkers. Its limiting to think that all we offer as women revolves around men. I made this post to state my thoughts on a comment I have seen made since I joined this group. That how much money you make doesn\u2019t influence the kind of man you marry. That men don\u2019t care about how much a women makes. I doubt a woman goes to college thinking that getting a degree will make more men interested in her. Having a degree is a vital way to advance your life, be it benefits it brings to you living a financially stable life, having a back up if you were to get a divorce or husband passed away.\n\nWomen marry across and up the economic ladder for the most part, so how successful the man you marry is can be influenced by your degree. The environment you are in, the place you live and the people you meet depends on how much you make. When you work to advance yourself financially, that shows you have the ambition, grit and persistence to accomplish a goal. And the benefits we gain from that is confidence in ourselves that we can take care of ourselves in life. That is admired by men. How many men would agree to being financially responsible for a girlfriend? If they didn\u2019t care about how much you made or your degrees they would have been okay being financially responsible for you. They do expect and like independence, although they might not hold the same expectations after marriage and kids.\n\nI grew up poor and that shapes the way I look at financial independence. The life I would lead if I have not strived to get out of that vs where I am at now is a stark difference. There is value in ambition and having high aspirations. So I think those comments are completely unnecessary and false and misleads women into thinking that having a career is not valuable.","title":"Having Career\/Degree is Important to Men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/o7ali6\/having_careerdegree_is_important_to_men\/"}

I have been making an an effort to not use \"like\" in my general speech and could tell that the way I spoke was different from the norm. \n2. I speak slower and with more intent (at least I try).\n3.  I am better at subtle flirting and playfulness with just my tone of voice (a bit subconscious, but it comes from getting into the right mind space).\n4. I hold eye contact during a lull in conversation longer than I would have maybe two years ago (without being afraid that it will be \"awkward\"). I feel this alsl increases tension and helps me determine if there is chemistry. \n5. I strive to be a better listener. We women love to talk endlessly and I have this problem sometimes, especially when the topic is good. I make a conscious effort to ask open-ended questions and hear what my conversationalist has to say.\n6. I don't reveal all at once. This is also my personality, but maybe it's especially stark with the right person? This one may be controversial because I like authentic people and I strive to be authentic. However I think keeping a little mystery as a prequel to more deep conversation is pretty nice. \n7. I was gracious in receiving compliments (or so I would hope) and giving them. I said thank you and smiled. I felt feminine. I let the feminine energy radiate rather than suppress it. \n\nThis is in stark contrast in how I approached first dates a year+ ago. There was no softness, little intention, less feminine mystery.

Universally most people agree that the one who is less committed to the relationship, controls the tide of the relationship. In sociology there is The Principle of Least Interest which is the idea that the person or group that has the least amount of interest in continuing a relationship has the most power over it. In the context of relationship dynamics, it suggests towards which party the balance of power tilts. In sex, the one who wants more sex gets to be at the mercy of the one who doesn\u2019t and emotionally, the more invested you are the more engaged you are in the relationship. This principle is universal and applies mostly where more than one party involved.  \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it until I got into freelancing. Two years in and my mentality changed, perhaps there was something else in play to determine who held the power in relationships. Now you are wondering what freelancing has got to do with the red pill but I will get there in just a second. When I began freelancing years ago, all I wanted was clients, people to pay me in exchange for the services I offered. There was one problem though, when I began, I had close to zero experience and I was in desperate need of money. I was more than happy when I landed a gig. The pay was low, even for a country I am in. And the client was abusive and basically controlled me but I was unable to say no to him, I basically did whatever he wanted, when he wanted it, no matter the circumstances I was in. I wanted the money and in that mindset I never thought that I was offering any value. All I saw was a person giving me money and saving me from my dire situation financially. It was an abusive relationship and it was clear I had no power in it.  \n\nAs my skill improved and I began attracting better clients, my confidence increased and my sense of self-worth began improving too. I knew I was offering something. I wasn\u2019t taking as I had initially thought. What I was doing was just as valuable as the money they were paying me. Initially I had thought that what I was offering was not as important as the money they were giving me and that put me in a \u201ctaking\u201d position and my clients as the \u201cgivers\u201d.  We know for a fact that people who give and offer value are valued. In the workplace, the people who offer solutions are promoted, people who are always happy to help without any hidden motives are liked and attract a lot of people. In healthy relationships both parties give and offer value to make the relationship work.  \n\nSomething clicked. I was offering value. I knew the worth of my value, I wasn\u2019t 'taking' their money anymore, I was offering my services and the incentive was the pay. I went back to my first client who we had worked with for a long time despite the working conditions and told him I was going to increase my prices and they\u2019ll have to match them or we would cease working together. I was ready to walk away, by this time he knew he had been underpaying me and his working conditions were brutal. He agreed but his behavior was still not professional and so three months later, we ended our relationship. I simply understood that my value was important and I deserved better than what he was offering me given what I was offering him.  \n\nNow back to relationships, are you a giver or a taker? What are you offering in the relationship? Most takers think in terms of what they\u2019ll lose if the relationship comes to an end. Think to when you were desperate in a relationship and chances are, it\u2019s because you felt that your partner was offering more than you and losing the partner would be a blow and so you cling on hoping it goes on. When you are in the giving mindset, you are not in the mindset of \u201cafraid to lose\u201d but in the mindset of \u201cCherishing what you have\u201d. That\u2019s what a healthy relationship is all about. Giving because you see value and being given because they see value and not a single person thinking that they offer more than the other.  \n\nThe one who gets in a relationship because he\/she is afraid of being alone is taking from the other person and will always be afraid to lose their person and will do anything to stay in it. If you get into a relationship with an ill intention, you are a taker and you will be a slave to it as long as the other person has what you want and you are not offering any value. You will always be worried about losing them. You don\u2019t cherish them, you do the bare minimum to keep them around which is selfish. When you are giving, when your self-worthy is healthy, you believe that you are worth as a person and a person being with you is not by mistake but because you are just as valuable. You won\u2019t have to resort to manipulation tactics to keep people around. It all comes down to how you feel when you are in a relationship, do you feel you are a valuable person worth deserving of love or do you feel they are doing you a favor by being with you because you feel you are not offering something or have nothing to offer.  \n\nOf course I am not disputing that being less invested emotionally won\u2019t give you an edge, but that is taking rather than giving and it means you are afraid to lose hence the manipulation tactics. This is just a theory and would love to hear more from you about this.","title":"Giving vs Taking","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/kkg7ju\/giving_vs_taking\/"}

I'm a longtime contributor to the sub, but so ashamed of what I have to say that I don't dare say it on my main account. \n\nI've been in a relationship for 2 years, in my mid twenties with a 30 year old man. We live together. He'd been talking marriage and kids, and for Christmas had given me a (decidedly unromantic) gift of civil marriage paperwork, all filled out, just waiting for my signature. Not romantic, but very practical. \n\nYesterday morning, I found out he had been cheating on me with his ex for a month, continuously, and that several months ago he cheated on me as well with her, when I was out of town. He cut off contact with her for a while after that, but I guess temptation got the better of him and he went back to her in early December. \n\n\nI have spent the past two years trying to implement everything RPW says you should do -- no nagging, sex whenever, being calm and submissive, etc. But having found this place only after my relationship had started, I never really vetted him the way I suppose I should have, and figured that in spite of all the mistakes and heartbreak (this isn't the first time he's cheated, but the others were near the beginning so I thought things had truly changed), if I implemented everything I learned here, I would be able to have the happy relationship I wanted. \n\n\nI made tons of posts about dealing with jealousy, mostly as a means of trying to teach myself how to deal with the gut feeling I had that something wasn't right. Because of course without trust and submission, you can't have a successful relationship. But for two years I've been deluding myself and using this place as a kind of crutch, telling myself that if only I managed to follow all the advice, I would achieve the happiness I wanted. Instead all it did was prolong the agony, because I'd spend my time trying to find reasons that his fuck ups were really my fault. Then I'd change as best I could, and maybe things were better for a while, but overall nothing really got better. Quite the opposite, clearly. \n\n\nThis isn't me saying that RPW doesn't work. I believe it does. But unfortunately it can't fix everything, and sometimes it's all too easily taken as a means of deluding oneself that everything can be okay, if only I change every little thing that might possibly have caused a problem. \n\n\nI know that there will be a lot of contributors saying that this is partly my fault, that I didn't act as I should have and I drove him to this as a result. And sure, in any relationship no fault ever lies 100% with one party. I could have been more accommodating, I could have tried harder to put my jealousy at bay (maybe if I had always shown him I trusted him, he wouldn't have felt harangued?), but in the end, I spent two years doing the best I possibly could, only to find out that the best just isn't good enough. \n\n\n\n","title":"When being RPW isn't enough","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/aepy8u\/when_being_rpw_isnt_enough\/"}

We are even embarking on a book club on one soon, which I can't wait for!  \n\n\n**(1) How To Talk To Anyone - Leil Lowndes.**  \nThis book is packed full of concise, actionable advice to become a strong conversationalist. Instead of vague advice like \"be engaged\", she gives you questions you can ask to show you're engaged.  \n\n\n**(2) When I Say No, I Feel Guilty - Manuel Smith (\"WISNIFG\")**  \nThis book is commonly recommended in male RP spheres but it is a gender neutral book about assertiveness. In fact, it has some wonderful parenting advice! It teaches you how to communicate your wants and needs in direct, honest, compassionate ways.  It is the source of common terminology like \"Fogging\" and \"Broken Record\". It also discusses the manipulative habits many have & their roots, which is incredibly helpful for anyone who has struggled with passive-aggressive behavior.   \n\n\n**(3) Surrendered Wife - Laura Doyle (\"SW\")**  \nSW pairs beautifully with WISNIFG because it takes gender neutral advice on assertiveness and puts it into a specifically feminine frame. The focus is on communicating clearly what you want and need; ceasing manipulation and passive aggressive behavior; and step-by-step ways to place your husband at the head of the household. This book is one of the more accessible entry books to RPW content because it's aimed at the modern woman and the specific ways in which we sabotage ourselves\/our relationships. \n\n**(4+5) For Women Only & For Men Only - Shaunti Feldhan**  \nThese books are very modern RPW content, too. For Women Only covers many sore points in modern relationships (such as what to make of wandering eyes). It also discusses the needs of men, many of which are eye opening if they've never been spelled out for you! For example, her surveys showed the overwhelming majority of men would rather be respected than loved, and the overwhelming majority of women would rather be loved than respected (in a situation where you could only pick one).  \nFor Men Only is a worthwhile read for women because it allows for some good self-reflection. It may help you put a voice to some needs\/wants which are otherwise hard to articulate. I personally cried like a baby when I read it because I felt so, *so* heard. It dredged up old hurts and gave me the space to reflect on & heal them.   \n\n**(6) Fascinating Womanhood - Helen Andelin (\"FW\")**  \nThis one is core reading. It discusses the spiritual and earthly aspects of becoming a feminine woman, as well as how to honor and enable the role of masculinity (protector\/provider\/leader) in your husband. To do this, it draws on examples from history, classical literature, and the Bible. I return to this book again and again, although I am not a religious person at all. If you are a non-religious woman dating a man who is religious or was raised in religion (even loosely), reading this book will also help you understand his roots (and, I'd argue, our western cultural roots at large). \n\n**(7) Secrets of Fascinating Womanhood - David Coory**  \nThis book is often mixed up with the true FW. This one is told from the perspective of a woman named Angela, whose marriage is at a breaking point. She joins a FW class. Each chapter outlines one lesson and then the impact on her life as she follows the lesson's assignments. She grows into a happy, healthy woman with a healing marriage. Some people find the story format easier to relate to or follow along, so it's a great companion to the original FW. \n\n**(8) How To Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie**  \nLike FW, this is a bit of an older book. This book is a primer on \"empathy in action\".  It teaches you how to exude charisma by being humble, respectful, and genuinely engaged with other people. The chapters on leadership strategy will help you learn how to collaboratively tackle problems, but they'll also teach you leadership cues to look for when you're vetting a man. If possible, get the original text which includes \"7 Rules to Make Your Home Life Happier\". \n\n**(9) Why Men Love Bitches - Sherry Argov**  \nThis one might be a little controversial but I actually think it's more important for RPW than others. We put a lot of emphasis on vetting men and this book is actually one strategy to keep vetting, rather than falling too hard\/too fast. For us, it's all too easy to fall into the trap of expending all our energy to show all of what we bring to the table *before* we pause to see if it's even reasonable to be doing so. Although I don't suggest anyone take the book's cooking suggestions too seriously, the core of the book emphasizes that you must always stay an interesting and engaged person; you must have healthy boundaries; and you must be vetting him. I actually think it's a pretty good female counterbalance to \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\".\n\n**(10) No More Mr. Nice Guy - Robert Glover**  \nThis is another book from the men's RP sidebar. Like WISNIFG, it's about being assertive and staying true to yourself, rather than losing your identity to interpersonal relationships. Because it is aimed at men (and especially men in dead bedroom marriages), it may not feel directly relatable to us at first. However, use it as an eye opener of the pitfalls and bad dynamics that can befall a marriage if you aren't vigilant. If you feel your relationship falling into some of the patterns or conflicts outlined in this book, it can be an eye opener for vetting (in newer relationships), or a sign that you may need to revisit your basics from SW and FW (within marriages\/LTRs).

They vastly underestimate the historical influence of women on shaping society and culture, for millennia \u2013 not within the workplace, but from home.\n\nArguably one of the only reasons man evolved from animal is that females developed selectivity in mating (discussed in length by JBP). We began to demand more of men, who grew upright, learned to work, make sacrifices, and built kingdoms and empires, for what? Power, yes, but ultimately, the highest quality women and offspring. Sexual demand for competent men transformed the world. 8,000 years ago, only one man was reproductively successful for every seventeen women, and in modern times, the global average is around one man to five women [(source)](https:\/\/psmag.com\/environment\/17-to-1-reproductive-success). Even online, a [study](https:\/\/medium.com\/@worstonlinedater\/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) on tinder reported that the top 20% of men are competing for the top 80% of women, and there are reports that women rate only the top 10% of men as \u201cabove average.\"  Translation: we have high standards. \n\nBut what are those standards and how have they changed over time? Are they high enough? What are the consequences to culture?\n\nWomen have a monopoly on deciding which men get to pass their genes on. Men change rapidly to meet the demands of women, not for children specifically, especially when they\u2019re younger, but certainly for the chance to get laid. As much as the MGTOW might want you to believe, men are still hardwired to desire reproduction, and if they aren\u2019t successful, they\u2019ve technically failed their evolutionary purpose. \n\nIt seems strange, then, that \u201cgood men\u201d out there seem few and far between. But women have loosened their legs and their standards, and men can increasingly get away with a lot of shit and still get the girl \u2013 be a lousy boyfriend, never commit, have no career or ambition, or even lie in bars and online profiles. Women in the dating market often lament the quality of \u201cmen these days\u201d while still rewarding those same men with sex. With an abundance of sexual opportunities and easy lays, there\u2019s little motivation for men to get their act together unless they aim to land a truly top tier woman. Being single should not be preferable to being married, but for many men these days, it is. Married men as recently as the 1950s were the only ones getting in between any women\u2019s legs, without resorting to prostitution and the lowest quality women. The risk was *too high* for women, who had a damn good reason to say no and *mean it.*  \n\nMany of you red pill women have done it \u2013 found a rare breed of confident, strong, good men. So have I. But to the women still out there searching for Mr. Right, especially if you\u2019re sleeping with men, or dating men, or moving in with men who didn\u2019t deserve it: *stop.* Continue to work on yourself, and become the best woman you can possibly be. Encourage other women to do the same. Then, raise your standards. If you sleep with men, even if you\u2019re on birth control, you\u2019re communicating to them that they deserve you. That he\u2019s good the way he his. In all likeliness, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s not who he could be. And since sex is a man\u2019s primary drive, if they are getting plenty of it without offering commitment, security, stability, strength, or ambition, he\u2019ll never change. And the consequences to society and culture have been and will continue to be devastating. \n\nThis might sound extreme, but unless you can say you\u2019re happy with the direction society is moving today, you bear the responsibility to help steer the course. We owe it to our future children to give them a good father, and we owe it to the future of our society to only let the good men pass on their genes as well as their virtues such as honesty and work ethic to the next generation. \n\nJust something to think about.

Marriage, children, and being a SAHW was always a when not if. \n\nHowever somewhere along the line I got distracted. I decided I was going to pursue medical school (with lots of encouragement from my immigrant parents lol). Thus I spent my entire college years focused on being the best premed I could be. That meant studying all day and night in the library and never going out with friends. \n\nAnd it worked. I got into med school and began my journey. Except it wasn't until I started that I truly realized how long of a journey this would be. In your head its like another 4 years of school that's nothing. But in reality its 4 years of school, 3+ years of residency, and a whole lot of uncertainty of where you'll be living during this time.   \n\nIm 2 years in now and starting to feel the weight of my decisions. Firstly, the fact that I wasted my college years and as a result never met anyone. Secondly the fact that I am in no position to \"settle down\" for the foreseeable future. Third, the fact that I cannot leave because medical school is expensive and I already have 200k in debt. Fourth, even when i eventually graduate I will still have to work to pay off my debt. \n\nI feel like I messed up my life. During my time in med school I met this perfect man who matched every box. He was traditional, wanted a SAHW, wanted children, wanted to provide, etc... We agreed on a lot of aspects. But then he found out I was a medical student and he could not continue. He wasn't willing to wait 5+ years for me to get my life together and I dont blame him. \n\nYou might say well why don't you try going after men in a similar career. Well the guy above was a doctor. Ive found that most male doctors dont actually want a doctor wife because they know the time and effort it takes to be one. \n\nI just feel frustrated. Frustrated at myself for making such a decision. Frustrated that my parents and society let me do so at such a young age. Frustrated that the life I have always dreamed of doesn't seem feasible anymore.

These subtler vetting points can be found not in dramatic conflicts nor extravagant expressions of love, but rather in your day-to-day interactions after you\u2019ve gotten more comfortable with each other.\n\nYour life summed up won\u2019t comprised of the exhilarating highs of fairytale romance and the devastating lows of heartbreak - mostly, it\u2019ll be made up of many repetitions of average, simple, and mundane daily life. If you want the majority of your life to be enjoyable and full of contentment, this is the area that you should pay attention to. **By noticing how your partner interacts with you and how he handles himself on an everyday basis now, you open your eyes to how he\u2019s likely to treat you for the rest of your relationship.**\n\n-\n\nSo what are the little things that we need to use for vetting? If you want more nuance in your understanding of your man, you should start by having a nuanced understanding of who you are. \n\nHere\u2019s a few questions to get the ball rolling - how do you communicate? What is your love language? How do you handle difficulties or conflict? What personality traits do you have? Are there any behaviors from your childhood\/family that you want to exemplify? That you want to steer clear of?\n\nBecause everyone will have different questions and answers, everyone will have different takes on how their partner reacts. It\u2019s up to you to determine what you want and which situations to look at. \n\n**Example:** I grew up in a home with very clear gender roles - my mom nurtured the family while my dad led us and provided for us. This is something I\u2019d love to mirror in my romantic relationship, so I\u2019ve paid attention if my man ever took the initiative to lead in daily situations. \n\nCan he effectively take the reins when I can\u2019t figure out how I\u2019m going to squeeze in all our plans for our weekend getaway? How does he react if his friends are rude or disrespectful to me? Is he eager to help me with a huge project he knows I\u2019m struggling on? Does he feel good when I do nurturing things like cook for him, or would he rather have more non-traditional adventure and spontaneity?\n\n**Example:** While I agreed with how my parents performed their gender roles, they both had major issues with entitlement and a huge lack of communication with each other. I\u2019m very conscious to not recreate this exhausting way of living, so I also look to see how my man handles small conflicts. \n\nDoes he get easily annoyed or moody when I download the wrong movie for our Netflix night or does he forgive me and treat me kindly? Does he show his appreciation when I cook him dinner, or does he just complain that it\u2019s too salty or bland while pouting over his plate? If he\u2019s upset with me, does he scream and yell at me or does he take time to cool down and explain what\u2019s on his mind?\n\n**Example:** When it comes to personality and habits, I\u2019m an introvert who likes to hang out at home. Does he make a blanket fort for us to cuddle in or does he itch to go hang out at the local watering hole instead? Do I genuinely laugh at his jokes and does he like theorizing about life with me, or do we often fall short of having fulfilling conversations? Is he super excited that I have a very high libido or is he tired of my advances?\n\n-\n\nEveryone will have different questions come to mind and different answers that they find acceptable, and that\u2019s okay. What\u2019s important is knowing what you want and taking frequent progress reports with examples from your daily life to see if you\u2019re getting there.\n\n**TLDR:** Look at your day-to-day lives and see how you and your man interact. You will never find Mr. Perfect, but you can definitely find someone whose overall disposition matches your own and tries his best to treat you fairly. The tiny, inconsequential interactions that you and your man have will be the building blocks of the rest of your lives together. Take note and use it to determine if he really is The One.\n\n**Note:** While it\u2019s important to vet your man like this, make sure that what you\u2019re bringing to the table is on point as well! Finding the best man for you is ultimately futile if he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re the best woman for him.

And WhereAreAllTheGoodMen... also a big shoutout to Alexander Grace and Stefan Molyneux.\n\n**Because it helps us understand men**. If every woman was born with the ability to immediately understand what life was like for men, we wouldn't need RPW. We wouldn't need STFU or Captain\/First Mate or have to be told that most men prefer domestic, sexually available, supportive virgins. In every other place on reddit, male speech is censored. Only in places like TRP will you find men willing to say things like \"I will only ever marry a virgin\". Even if it's not true for everyone, at least you're hearing an uncensored cross section of beliefs.\n\n**Because western society is gynocentric.** It's considered acceptable to call men trash, and all sorts of other names, but not acceptable in reverse. If you want to find out who the most privileged members of society are, find out who you can't criticise. Harmless jokes like \"women can't drive\" are believed to be thoughtcrime. It doesn't actually result in any discrimination, but that doesn't matter. It's taboo anyway. So everytime you feel *offended* reading TRP or WAATGM, take a deep breath, and realise this is good for you. It's building you a thicker skin. Have a laugh at yourself and move on. [As Norah Vincent said](https:\/\/youtu.be\/0-uv8gT9Kxw) being a woman is a privilege. Relax, you are already winning.\n\n**It helps you realise your own faults.** There are many things to criticise women for. You need to be able to take a good hard look at yourself and determine whether it is truly something you are at fault for. Are you guilty of witholding sex? Are you guilty of monkey branching? Are you guilty of dating men you knew to be losers? If things like this bother you, it may well be because they are true. Take the time to reflect and chill out. Work on what you can fix and don't make the same mistakes again. Forgive yourself and make a plan for self improvement. There are many good people here on RPW who can help - in fact, it's probably already in the sidebar. **Self awareness does not come naturally**. It has to be sought out. And no one realises women's faults better than RP-ers and MGTOWs.\u00a0\n\n**Potential downsides.** You could begin to hate men. You could begin to hate yourself. You could go through the TRP \"anger phase\" - I certainly did. But it was worth it. It took about a year or more. I can now read TRP and other subreddits without batting an eyelid. I find in real life, men who dislike your actions or your past will never stick around long enough for you to find out. And I am very secure with the friendships and mentorship I have from older men, who view me as a worthwhile woman, without any promise of sexual access.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading.","title":"Why You Should Read TRP","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/jrch1c\/why_you_should_read_trp\/"}

This is the year you start reading more, get to work early every day, eat out less, and most importantly, find love! That was my goal every year until January 1st, 2015... and every year, I engaged in what a friend once dubbed \"panic dating.\" I would go on as many dates as possible, often talking to several men at a time, struggling to keep the details straight, determined to find love. Ultimately, I'd burn myself out on the whole thing by March, when I would retreat to my single girl apartment watch *Yours, Mine, and Ours* and cry because I didn't have time to have ten children. A credit to my younger self, retreat was the right response to dating fatigue and one I'd encourage, as we go into the new year.\n\nWhile we all just want to find our person, it's natural to find times in your life, when dating just isn't a good idea. Perhaps a loved one has died, or you've gone back to school, started a new job. Maybe you're just exhausted by the whole thing. Time and time again, I read posts and comments from women asking if they should go into \"nun mode\" or keep trying, despite their disinterest and discomfort. At this point, however, the fear of being alone sets even the most sincere dating efforts to panic mode. However disengaged, *you're not getting any younger and must find love now!*\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking, is that dating doesn't only require *your* energy and attention. It demands it from *another human,* as well. It seems obvious, but with the ubiquity of online dating, it's easy to forget that the message you ignored came from a real man. He likely felt hopeful when he sent it, whether it was an introduction or part of a continued conversation. He might have even been excited about meeting you, if you'd begun to discuss it before you decided that you didn't have time, he must be bald under that hat, an hour away was just too far...\n\nJust before I met my husband, I read the book *Marry Him: the Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough*, by Lori Gottlieb, which opened my eyes to some of my less reasonable deal breakers. I cannot tell you how irrelevant my husband's height is in our daily lives or how little it matters that he's losing his hair, especially as we get older and *all of the men are losing their hair.* It was soon after this literary discovery, that I sat thumbing through all of my matches on my dating apps, only to realize that... *I'd dated all the men*. That's an exaggeration of course, but just about any profile I came across, belonged to someone I'd already messaged or even met in person. The guys who were left didn't meet my requirements, however reasonable they might have been. That's when I realized that the number of eligible men, especially as I was reaching my late twenties, really was finite.\n\nJust as Gottlieb had warned me, the reason they say all the good ones are taken, is because eventually, *it's true.* I thought back on the men I'd nexted and reconsidered whether I was justified and fortunately, felt confident that only one or two might have been worthy of another date. I breathed a sigh of relief at all the times I'd taken genuine breaks from dating, instead of talking to men, only to brush them off... because those were the men that were left when I returned in better spirits... and there weren't many of them. \n\n*Of course*, I didn't owe anyone anything after a few messages, but it was on our third date, that my now husband informed me that he'd sent me a message a few months before receiving mine. I *genuinely* did not remember this, nor did I recall why I didn't respond. I could have been talking to someone, not seriously dating, or just nexted him based on distance, before realizing I'd dated the greater Metro area and expanding my radius. Luckily for me, he still responded to my message, because while I didn't remember ignoring him, *he* remembered being ignored. Being a man, living in a rural town, he didn't get as many messages as I did and that brush off didn't fade into dozens of others.\n\nSo I caution you, as you go into the new year, with renewed enthusiasm for dating, to remember that the decent men in your area truly are limited, even if it feels like there's always a better match. Even if you *do* look like 22-year-old Blake Lively, time is going to pass. If you're ghosting and nexting good guys, because they aren't Ryan Reynolds, or you just don't have the energy right now, you're quite likely to find yourself thumbing through the discards and reconsidering, in time. Don't only concentrate on vetting for more important qualities, such as faith and politics and interest in marriage and family, but decide whether or not you're actually *interested* in dating right now. If you just got home from *the worst date ever*, and you're  crying because he mocked your Catholic faith and called Jesus a *biscuit* (true story), it's okay to take a break.

I will therefore attempt to explain each one, how they intertwine and how they differ. \n\n**Preface** \n\nWe use the term \"market value\" because in any market the price of goods and services is determined by supply and demand. It's a sellers market when there's high demand and lower supply, this will cause prices to rise. When 100 people want an item of which there are only 50, they will have to pay more for that item. This is because buyers have to compete with each other over a product that's scarce. \n\nThe reverse is when there's high supply and low demand. This is when it's a buyers market and prices therefore drop. When there are only 50 buyers but 100 items for sale, sellers will have to compete with each other to attract buyers to sell their wares. They will have to lower their prices to do so. \n\nOf course, there's a lot more to the dynamics of markets. This little bit will suffice for the discussion at hand. \n\n**SMV - Sexual Market Value** \n\nBoth men and women have SMV because both men and women are sexually desired by each other. However, the fact that men as a whole desire sex in much greater frequency and variety than women, makes men the \"buyers\" and women the \"sellers\" of sex. Therefore a 7\/10 SMV in a woman is more valuable than a 7\/10 SMV in a man. This is also the reason why women have the upper hand and are therefore the gatekeepers of sex. \n\nSMV is what makes you sexually desirable to the opposite sex. Men and women find different things attractive in one another, therefore different things will boost the SMV of men and women. \n\n**RMV - relationship market value**\n\nBother men and women have RMV because both men and women are desired by each other for the purpose of a LTR. However, the fact that women as a whole desire a LTR more than men do, makes women the \"buyers\" and men the \"sellers\" of relationships. Therefore, a man with a 7\/10 RMV is more valuable than a woman with a 7\/10 RMV. This is also the reason why men have the upper hand and are therefore the gatekeepers of relationships. \n\nRMV is what makes you a desirable long term mate to the opposite sex. Men and women find different things desirable for the long term, therefore different things will boost the RMV of men and women. \n\n**Turbulence and stability** \n\nTurbulence and stability are opposites. One is constantly moving, jumpy, unpredictable, exciting, passionate and sexy. Sex is a turbulent thing (generally speaking). Sex involves an elevated heart rate, excitement and other elements that cannot be maintained in a stable manner 24\/7. \n\nStability doesn't budge. It's predictable and boring, not passionate and not very sexy. Stability is reassuring and comforting. The way it is today is the way it was yesterday and the way it will be tomorrow. Think of the structure of your house, you want it to not move ever no matter what winds, rain or snow come it's way. Stability is 24\/7. When we built a relationship, we strive for it to be as stable as can be. \n\n**Intersection** \n\nStability and routine can become boring. We also have a need for passion, excitement, unpredictability and sexuality. How can these two opposites dwell together within the same home? \n\nThe analogy of a home is a good one. We have the foundation and structure that need to be very stable and only stable. We have the heating and cooling and electrical systems which are all turbulent moving parts which have been harnessed in a constructive manner. Then we have things like the doors and windows which are sometimes locked and shuttered and stable, while other times they can open and allow others into our home. \n\nTo translate this into marriage - the foundation and structure needs to be built upon a solid commitment that doesn't waver by the onset of turbulence such as \"wind\" from the outside or an argument from the inside. Once the commitment is there, we can harness turbulent things such as sex, passion, excitement etc into constructive forces just like we do with electricity, water and fire. We also have elements where we can allow others in at specific times but not other times, we'll allow this person in but not that person. These are the various people we allow into our relationship to varying degrees based on the need. Discretion needs to be used to decide when to open the door and when to lock it. \n\nA healthy marriage has a clear understanding of what is what and what goes where. A healthy marriage also has a good balance between stability and excitement. This is how men and women can built a beautiful home together, a home that's nice and warm in the winter and cool in the summer.A home that keeps negative outside forces such as rain, animals and intruders on the outside while guarding those on the inside. A home that is a pleasant place to live. \n\n**Caution** \n\nProblem is that certain things might be a boost to sexuality but a detriment to relationships or vice versa. For example \n\n* A man who's committed heart and soul to his wife and children, he provides them with everything etc but has developed a dad bod, he's overly emotional, he doesn't lead etc. He may have some RMV, but his SMV has plummeted. He will wonder why his wife never wants sex. \n\n* A women who has the perfect body, is feminine, is awesome in bed etc. She has sex on the first date if she fancies the guy. She will wonder why everyone disappears, where are all the good men? \n\nThere can be many more examples. The common denominator is that in both cases a person was focused **exclusively** on their SMV or their RMV. If you elevate your SMV but neglect your RMV, you can end up a 10\/10 in the sexual market but only a 2\/10 in the relationship market. This person will attract people of a very high sexual caliber and wonder why they can't attract people of the same caliber for a long term commitment. \n\nThe same is true in the reverse. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nA healthy balance needs to be found between what's attractive to you specifically from a relationship point of view and what's attractive to you specifically from a sexual point of view. Both are extremely important. Neglecting one or the other will have disastrous outcomes. \n\nIt's like the right and left side of your body. They serve different functions but both are very important to have. Your right side is the turbulent side. It's the side that goes and moves according to the situation at hand. The left side is the side that's grounded and stable. When you kick a ball, your right foot does the swinging and your left foot keeps you grounded. \n\nPeople often get confused by what seems to be mixed messages of TRP. A man who is only looking for sex will only discuss SMV and completely ignore RMV. What may be a plus in the sexual market may be a minus in the relationship market. A woman who is only looking for a relationship may say things that make men wonder why the cognitive dissonance. But that woman is only looking at the relationship market. Her advice may not help in the sexual market at all. It may even be a negative there. \n\nUltimately, balance and harmony between the two is what we strive for here at RPW.\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n","title":"SMV & RMV","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5j2g6t\/smv_rmv\/"}

Aren't these two things contradictory? \n\nAnd our whole society is caught in a war between two cultures. \n\nThe tradcon side, which is slowly losing, says \n\n* \"Men, you must give up the desire for a woman to sexually surrender quickly... instead, you must invest time and resources in her, make her promises you cannot easily break, before she will give you what you desire.\"\n\n* \"Women, you must restrain your desires and be calculating. It is your job to test a man's commitment to you and make him jump through many hoops (ideally on fire) before he gets access to your precious lady parts.\"\n\n\nThe liberal side, which is slowly winning, says\n\n* \"Men, you must give up your desire not to marry the town bicycle.

We'll make sure the men are docile and obedient.\" \n\n\nThe tiny, unnoticed redpill side rolls its eyes, and says:\n\n* You cannot tell men to \"give up\" this or that desire. Desire is not a choice. Desire cannot be negotiated. If men want both these things, then the girl who achieves the most of both will have the most desireable men. \n\n* And here's a [long complicated explanation](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1j0n7t\/the_slut_and_how_not_to_be_one\/) of why these things can coexist, which lots of people will read and not understand. \n\n\nSo the liberal and tradcon answers are just plain wrong. \n\nAnd the red pill answer has [too much boring math](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/1n149v\/is_the_number_of_guys_a_girl_has_been_with_really\/cceqjhy).  \n\nTime to simplify. \n\n**Why** do men want low-count women? **Why** do men want sexually eager women?\n\n**Passion. Men want women who are passionate about them.**\n\nA woman who is passionate about a man does not consult her girlfriends about what an \"acceptable\" amount of time to \"make him wait\" is. A woman who is passionate about a man does not bargain the promise of her body for a wedding, like some jaded whore negotiating a \"session\". A woman who is passionate about a man will find a way to reach his bed. She will fly across the country, crawl under barbed wire, climb in through his second story window, do everything he desires, and wait patiently inside his closet if his wife comes home early from work. \n\n**Women do not withhold sex from men they are passionate about. A woman is not passionate about a man if she withholds sex from him.** Unless she is seriously physically ill, or *on fire at that very moment*, she is ready when he is. \n\nSimilarly, a woman who has tasted a hundred men over her thirty years of life is not going to be enthralled by the hundred and first. Not only is the experience far from new or unique, he is unlikely to be the best or most attractive man she has had, since she was younger, more beautiful, and more innocent before, and could command the attention of a better variety of man. \n\n**Women are generally the most passionate about their first partner, and gradually less so with each new one. This is not their first rodeo.**\n\n\n\n**Now we understand how these two male desires are NOT contradictory. They are actually the SAME desire... the desire to be both loved, and lusted after, passionately, utterly, and completely.**\n\n\n\nWhen a woman has a high partner count, a man asks himself \"None of them kept her... why should I?\".\n\nWhen a woman delays, withholds, and asks for promises or time, a man says \"She is cool-headed enough about me to negotiate. To enforce a policy. She regards sex with me as *a price to pay* for what she wants... not a joy she urgently desires.\"\n\nIn fact, if a woman delays sex to avoid risk to her partner count, because a low count makes her more attractive, *just who* is this low count making her more attractive to?  \n\n*It makes her more attractive to other men.* It does nothing for him. He of course expects to increase her count by one, because he wishes to be that one. If she hedges, then she is saying to him \"I don't want to risk being less sexy, or less commitment-worthy, to *the next guy*.\"\n\nShe is already looking past him and the relationship hasn't even started yet. She is not \"all in\" with him, and he knows that. \n\nWhy would he be committed to her, when she is not committed to him? \n\n*But what is a woman to do about all this? How can she be passionate, and unrestrained, with men, without destroying her value from an accumulation of failures?*\n\nThis, I will discuss in Part Two.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Passion","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4ebnsb\/passion\/"}

In fact, your RMV should be steadily rising as you age, even if your SMV is simultaneously declining (it should be at a much slower rate). Let\u2019s discuss how: \n\n*1. Aging is not an excuse to let yourself go.*\n\nAs you get older, you should be continually gaining a better understanding of how your body works. Try different workouts and figure out which ones you enjoy the most and which get you the best results. Same with different diets and eating habits. For example, if you started lifting at 22, imagine how much bigger and better your ass would be at 30 after 8 years of hip thrusting heavy ass weights. You get the picture. Don\u2019t allow yourself to make excuses, such as \u201ceveryone gets flabby as they get old\u201d, or \u201cno one has time for the gym\u201d. False. If you have 30 minutes to watch an episode on Netflix or to read Reddit posts, you have 30 minutes to burn out your abs and booty. \n\nThere is even less of an excuse to not be taking care of your skin. I didn\u2019t start washing my face regularly, let alone moisturizing or wearing sunscreen, until my mid-20s. As you can imagine, my skin is so much more youthful looking, fresh and glowing now than 10 years ago, since I am actually intentionally taking care it. A basic skincare routine takes just 30 seconds, morning and evening. Yes, as you age, some wrinkles will be inevitable from gravity, but it is very easy and inexpensive to at a minimum have moisturized, glowy, sunspot-free skin. All it requires is consistency. Do some research, experiment, and figure out what works for you. As your budget permits, you can always get fancy with medspa-level procedures and products, but an inexpensive simple routine can truly work wonders over the long haul. \n\n*2. Carry yourself with more elegance, grace and confidence.*\n\nAs you age, you should be continually improving and refining your social skills, charisma, and etiquette, all of which make you more magnetic and attractive to all people. You should continue to develop your sense of style, dressing in a way that elevates you, moving and standing with more of a poise and confidence. Finding your most flattering hair style, building a wardrobe of high quality staples, developing your makeup techniques so they stay refreshed with the times (instead of becoming dated), etc. are all things that happen slowly and with intentionality over time. Don\u2019t allow yourself to stay static and then wonder why the same old makeup routine or outfits from 10 years ago are no longer working for you. Change with the times. Continue to make an entrance and be striking. \n\nSimilarly, there simply is no excuse to remaining socially awkward or being a bad conversationalist in your 30s. I was home schooled, and grew up completely isolated from the outside world with nearly zero social interactions outside of my family. But I was determined to not live my life as an embarrassingly awkward person, and forced myself to be uncomfortable socializing until it started becoming more natural. I\u2019ve read so many books on it, forced myself to go to so many random meet-up groups to talk to strangers, did toastmasters, took public speaking courses, etc. Now, people can\u2019t believe that I am actually introverted. I\u2019m known for bringing interesting people together and hosting fun dinner parties. I\u2019ve noticed this has been a huge plus to everyone I\u2019ve dated since my early 20s, not just for being a better, less awkward date one-on-one, but also because men love having someone they can bring to work events, client dinners, and into their friend and family circle that they can trust to smooth things over socially and leave everyone with a great impression, no matter who they are. You truly become an asset for this alone. \n\nThis applies to whatever your weaknesses are in your youth. Use time as your weapon to improve and transform over the long haul. \n\n*3. Continually develop your relationship skills - even when single.* \n\nEven when you\u2019re single, there is no excuse to not be continually improving your cooking skills, communication skills, and overall femininity. You can and should be practicing expressing pure desires, actively listening and respecting others thoughts, eradicating complaining, prioritizing self care, and generally being the \u201cgoddess of fun and light\u201d even while single. Do it with friends, coworkers, family, embody it until it becomes who you are\u2014not just something you try to do when you\u2019re in a relationship. Relationship skills are just that\u2014skills that need to be proactively worked at in order to improve. How you show up at 32, 10 years into actively practicing the intimacy skills will be very different from how you are at 22, just trying to figure things out and haphazardly trying to implement the skills. The peace and joy that you bring into a relationship after maturing in your relationship skills will be so much more valuable than your bumbling attempts early on. \n\n*4. Everything is relative, and men are aging too.*\n\nRemember, men are aging too. When you\u2019re 20, 30 feels so old, because you\u2019re surrounded by other 20 year olds and attracted to other 20 year olds. When you\u2019re 30, you don\u2019t care whether that 20 year old boy finds you attractive. You\u2019re still a baby to a 40 year old man, and right in the same chapter of life as your fellow 30 year old, who is just as much insecure about his receding hairline as you are about the beginnings of fine lines under your eyes. Despite what internet creeps would have you believe, most good men are not walking around trying to date significantly younger women, for a variety of reasons. They want someone roughly the same age, who is taking care of themselves physically and maintaining their looks, still maintaining a sense of joy and fun that usually comes with youth, and who also brings the relationship skills to the table that only come with time. \n\nYou can\u2019t allow your fear of aging to cripple you. It comes for everyone. Do what you can to be continually improving and become a more valuable partner over time.

I'm not saying that dynamic can't work, but I saw my dad and mom fight and argue in their struggle to establish who was the masculine one in the relationship before his death.\n\nI say all this to show that I had no feminine role model to base my exchanges with men on. And I had no father to guide me on what a man wants. It wasn't until I was well into my college years that I realized I was acting like my mother... I was acting like I wanted to be a man. Thus, I  started my journey to get in touch with my feminine. To LIVE in it. And, on this journey, I want to share what I learn with this community because I feel like we learn better if we learn together.\n\nSo today, I learned that a woman who can inspire a man to BE a MAN (you know...devoted, leader, provider, etc.) must have two things: \n1. Respect for her man. Why? Because he is worthy and has value...we often hear this a lot and understand it in this sub.\n2. Respect for herself...which a lot of women that are submissive sometimes end up lacking. YOU are also worthy and have value!\n\nWhen a woman shows respect for her man and not for herself, she shows that she is less valuable than he is. And the opposite is true. When a woman shows respect for herself and not her man, she is showing that he is less valuable than her. A woman that does both, shows respect for herself and her man, can inspire a man to be a man.\n\nSo how do you show respect for your man?\n- Yield to him. He is a leader.\n- Be grateful. Show you appreciate him.\n- NO MANIPULATION. If he's in charge, he's in charge!\n- No nagging. Show that you trust him and his abilities.\n- Do not try to force him to change who he is. You must accept him.\n\nEasy enough. But how do you show respect for yourself?\n- Trade submission for devotion. You deserve devotion, so when you have it is when you submit.\n- Remain a receiver, not a giver. You don't need to do anything special to deserve gifts.\n-  Express yourself openly AND healthily. Your needs do matter.\n- Speak up for yourself. Your feelings do matter.\n- Establish boundaries, and be prepared to walk away if your boundaries are being crossed or needs aren't being met.\n\nAll in all, unknowingly showing disrespect to your man or to yourself can lead to problems in a relationship.\n\nBut, again, this is just what I've learned. I'd love to hear y'alls opinion based on what you know and\/or what you think about the information I've provided!\n\nHave a wonderful day (or night).","title":"Disrespect will be your Downfall","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/10fpam2\/disrespect_will_be_your_downfall\/"}

The overarching suggestion was to just have another conversation. u\/thetwincessmaker gave me a helpful script that I actually had in hand on my phone as I approached the conversation. \n\nWhat I essentially asked: \n\n* \"I want to get out of debt, so we can start planning for a family.

Also, I would really appreciate suggestions on how I can make things better. \n\n\n\nI'm a stay at home mom. I cook, clean, iron, pick up and drop off kids to and from their activities.

When I tried to explain to him that I was really tired, he got angry and told me to go sleep on the couch if I wasn't going to make myself useful in bed. I begged him to calm down, but he said he was laying down the law. He picked up my pillow and three it out of the bedroom. \n\n\nI left the room quietly and slept on the couch in the living room.  The next morning I tried to apologize to him, but he just gave me angry looks. When he came home that evening, I had prepared his favorite meal and was made up and in a nice dress.

My n-count is not low, and I enjoyed short-term and casual relationships in my early twenties. I also happen to have a very high libido and other somewhat masculine traits, like high ambition and high intellectual curiosity. Despite this, I was nowhere near emotionally ready to have a mature relationship with a man and I was deathly afraid of real connection and committment.\n\nI moved to East Asia at 19 having no cultural or ethnic ties to the region simply to learn the language and experience another country. I was also quite nerdy and enjoyed debate and critical analysis on a variety of topics. I got highly educated and am learning how to code to bring it to the next level. I was a successful, interesting, free-spirited woman who couldn't get a man to commit to her.\n\nI was also, of course, a feminist, reblogging feminist memes on Tumblr and in general being pretty angry at the world and having a low opinion of men.\n\nI started reading TRP and later RPW when I was around 26, and it changed my perspective of the world.\n\nIt wasn't instantaneous, and it took many years of reflection, living life, and debate with friends to reconcile what I had learned with my lived reality, my personality, and my biological realities.\n\nI learned to accept that men and women *are* scientifically different, and there is no point in trying to deny it. It makes no logical sense, with all knowledge we have on the way hormones affect everything from your physiology to your personality, that men and women with such bodies should function the exact same way. From there on, RPW opened me up to become the woman I am today.\n\nI am still unconventional. At 31, I just now met a man that I fully want to commit to, think is a good match for me, and is as into me as I am into him. RPW has helped in giving me the confidence that I can be a good mate to him: it taught me that it is not weak and stupid to want to provide for your man. Stomach full and balls empty are the basics, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Luckily he is a very giving, caring person who also genuinely enjoys pampering me in turn. I use my feminine charms to delight him and make him express his masculinity, and I don't care anymore if anyone thinks that's sexist.\n\nI learned that sexual loyalty is very, very important, and that women should not have casual sex to express their independence when it is jeapordizing what they really want. Our relationship was LDR for a brief moment and we weren't an official couple yet, so it would've been okay for me to go on dates and sleep with other men \"in the interim.\" I chose not to. It was absolutely the right decision, and he is appreciates my restraint and investment in us. I've been very honest with him about my past and he is okay with it; we both run in liberal, very left circles so he's used to \"strong women owning their sexuality.\" But he appreciates even more that I now feel that my sexualiy should be for him only.\n\nI am happier than I could have ever been, and wanted to say my thanks to the community. I am not like many of you who figured out they wanted marriage and children in their teens or early twenties and made it happen. I admire the fact you were mature enough at that age and that you already knew what you wanted; I was absolutely a lost child in my early 20s.\n\nSo once again, thank you, RPW. There's so much value here for women who didn't follow the SAHM route. The principles remain the same and for me, it has made my life and my relationship immeasurably better.","title":"How RPG helped me become a better woman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/bqhocz\/how_rpg_helped_me_become_a_better_woman\/"}

Once upon a time there used to be a man who roamed from region to region forced by poverty and circumstance to find a new home. As he made his way, he came to a forest that was so dense and thick. As the story goes, the man got lost in this forest and it wasn't long before his path led him to a charging elephant.\u00a0 \n\nAfraid for his life he dashed away but in his efforts to escape the charging elephant,\u00a0 he came across something more dangerous and sinister, a sword wielding demoness. Shocked and fear stricken by the presence of the demoness, the man sought to free to a more safer place to hide. It wasn't long before he came across a tall towering tree that would provide him the protection and security he so much needed. \n\nThe man tried to climb the tree but it was too thick for him and the branches were so up in the tree for him to hold on to.\u00a0 Standing before the tree, his hope faltered as he heard the approaching rumble of the elephant and the ghastly screech of the demoness who was nearly upon him now. And then something caught his sight. An abandoned well that plunged deep into the ground just a few feel from where he stood. Panicking and afraid of what might happen to him should the demoness catch him, the man jumped head first into the well without too much thought.\n\nIt was while he was falling thay he realized what a great mistake he'd made. Luckily for him, before he could hit the bottom of the well, the tangled vegetation that had colonized the well, caught him up preventing his fall. Dangling with terror above and the unknown below he clang on to the walls of the well. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness around him, he soon realized what he had thought was the ground below him were but a number of snakes that had been stirred up by his presence in the well. Amongst the snakes was a great python with his mouth wide open as if expecting his fall. His attention turned towards the mouth of the well as he heard the elephant madly pacing it's edges and shaking the walls of the well.\u00a0 At the edge of the vegetation there were mice eating it away. He wondered how long the tangled vegetation would hold him before giving him up to the snakes below him. \n\nAs the elephant above paced around the well, it hit the tree and a honeycomb that was lodged into the tall tree came falling into the well onto him. He clung as on to the walls as the bees bit him with anger. And then in that moment the man caught the taste of the sweet honey as it dripped from the honeycomb through his tightly shut eyes and until it finally reached his lips. And all he could think of in that moment, was not the danger he was in but how he could get more of that sweet honey.\n\nThe story above is a parable. It has it's roots in the Indian tradition.\u00a0 It is about the cycle of death and rebirth. The man roaming from region to region and is lost wandering in the forest represents the cycle of death and rebirth. The man himself represents that part of us that is trapped in the cycle, the elephant is death itself and the demoness is infamity, old age and disease. The man frees in fear of these towards the tree which represents liberation, a place where death and disease can't reach. The man however can't attain such salvation because he isn't well prepared. The man can't climb so he dives into the well,\u00a0 which represents the human condition, what it means to be human being who has not yet been liberated from the cycle of death and rebirth. The well is filled with snakes which represents our desires and passions, our attachments and aversions. The great python in the middle represents where we are headed if things don't take a turn for the better. A hellish rebirth. The tangled vegetation represent the limited time we have while the mice represent the wearing away of that time. The bees represent our pain and everyday troubles.\u00a0 And the honey represents the seemingly satisfying pleasures that distract us from our troubles. The honey is not something good, it causes us to ignore the seriousness of our situation, it causes the man to forget the urgency of getting out of the well.\u00a0\n\nThere is a lot that we do daily that is geared towards forgeting our pain. Procrastinating, Using drugs and instant gratification. All this things do is make us feel good, only for a brief moment while making us forget of the bigger picture we should be pursuing. We do not want to take responsibility for our lives but whether we choose to act now or later, it doesn't change one simple fact: The clock is ticking.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt some point in your life you'd have to accept that you can no longer keep blaming your guardians for the way your life turrned out to be, even if they\u00a0 did negatively impact it and take responsibility for how your life will be. One of the most empowering statements I did come across is that NO ONE IS COMING. You have to start taking steps to get better. Improve yourself. Be geared towards your goals.\u00a0\n\nThe best gift we have in life is the fact that to some degree we have the power to shape our lives to be how we want them to be. There is no fate. There is no script to follow. We can pull out of the herd mentality, pull out of conformity and create a magnificent life for us that we can be proud of.\n\nStop being a victim, Stop being entitled and take control of your life. The tall tree has much more to give than the well but to attain it, it requires self discipline and higher level of awareness and an unbiased view towards the truth.\u00a0","title":"Avoid Distractions: Stay Focused On Making Yoursef Better","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/j4rk41\/avoid_distractions_stay_focused_on_making_yoursef\/"}

I'm 29F and I'd like to share my experience until now about my nun mode. I entered the nun mode at march, after the end of a relationship. When I saw how miserable I was, and how I was always at relationships with the same kind of guys for a while, I decided I need some alone time to focus. My nun mode is suposed to last until the end of the year or until my birthday (february).\n\nSome background: I started dating at 14 and have been in some serious relationships. Some were very good and some were catastrophic. When I was 25, I spent a year at casual dating, but I felt horrible because it seemed like I was disposable. At the relationships, I was somehow clingy, anxious and validation seeker. And my 4 last relationships were with selfish, manipulative, cold and gaslighter guys, and beyond. I didn't saw those things at the beginning because they were also very good actors, and I was also very blind, VERY naive and also forgave a lot. More background, outside relationships: I'm gratuated, have a job, have mental health issues since kid (anxiety, depression, etc), have my hobbies, some friends and many insecurities.\n\nHere I am at my 7mo and decided to share some of my experience until now because I made a good decision today.\n\nSo, as I said, I have depression. This week I'm feeling very lonely, very \"omg my friends don't like me\", \"I'll never make new friends, I'm very uninteresting and boring\", yadda yadda. I thought of go back to dating, since I could at least talk with someone, spend some time with a new person and at least have some company to have dinner. Then, the bright light: I decided to not make this, because I was seeking a guy to fulfill something I can fulfill myself. I realised I need to learn how to make friends before go back into dating. Find a way to deal with this false loneliness before go to any date. Or I'll make the same mistakes as before. Sounds obvious, but I'm really proud of myself of being aware of this now.\n\nSpeaking about this, my mental health is SO much better now. I don't have to deal with a toxic guy who makes my mental health go on a downward spiral. I have so much to improve, but I'm more conscious now about my qualities, my self steem, my flaws and my power. I know what triggers me and what boost my mood.\n\nI'm pursuing my dreams, reliving my hobbies, interacting with outside world more. I'm pursuing what I really want, not what it's convenient for some guy or some relationship. I'm really owning my life.\n\nBeing without sex this whole period was easy at the beginning, since I was disgusted by my ex, but now is becoming difficult. On the brighter side, people are starting to look attractive again. And I'm learning how to make myself interesting, be better at conversations, how to flirt and things like that. Very important, I'm training some vetting with random people I meet, like coworkers and friends of friends, and starting to understant people better.\n\nI'm aware now of how much I used to give of myself at my past relationships. I would give myself and my whole time if they asked. Now I know better what is the ideal balance for me. I'm more aware too of unacceptable things, and what are my true interests if I have another relationship again.\n\nI started to make courses, to travel more, to explore more the city I live, to dedicate seriously to my career, to remake bounds with older friends, to accept myself. I'm also back to therapy to discuss about a lot of past traumas and get better with my self steem, this attachment and validation problem, and so on.\n\nAlso, I feel so happy right now. I'm really learning to love myself and be my best company. I'd never learn this without the nun mode, since my whole life was about seeking a guy to feel good. Thank you so much for the posts, the advices and the community, you are a very important part of this growing.","title":"Notes about my 7mo nun mode","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/dh23an\/notes_about_my_7mo_nun_mode\/"}

You guys have no idea how much your words meant to me. \n\n\n\nSo about the subject line. I have been studiously been dressing much more femininely and taking special care of my grooming. (The Ordinary is a really great, effective, and unbelievably inexpensive skincare line, if anyone is looking for good skincare.) I have my two toddler sons at home, and I have automatically gotten up either with them or earlier and gotten dressed like I used to before my stay-at-home days. I do my hair, choose an outfit, and do makeup. Some days are fancy and some are just t-shirt and shorts, and I dress to fit my mood. My own personal standard is that, however I choose to look that day, I make sure I look attractive and my best, casual in jeans and t shirt or a little more frilly in a sun dress. For all the stay-at-home moms, this is really a great way to get your head in the game. At first I did it all for my husband, but I realized I had missed this and really enjoy taking the time to be careful and expressive with what I wear and how I present myself. I used to do it all the time \u201cbefore kids,\u201d but I thought I had to have an excuse, a reason to dress and care for myself, and I had thought that staying at home meant no one would see me, so no one would care, and doing it for myself a wasnt enough of a reason. Wrong. I\u2019ve enjoy it so much! I feel happier with myself! It\u2019s also better for my family in so many ways. My boys don\u2019t go to any daycare or preschools: they\u2019re with me all the time and we just have tons of mom groups and play dates, so when I dress nicely it helps them see a more accurate idea of how people act \u201cout there.\u201d My husband has also said many things and acted very appreciative. \n\nBut here\u2019s the issue. I feel great inside my own home, at the grocery store, doing errands, and interacting with strangers, but most of the other woman I\u2019m acquainted with seem to react with a soft negative. Whenever I see other women, and other moms, it\u2019s like a social contract that all of us must be in yoga pants, messy bun, yesterday\u2019s t-shirt or too cool to care about how we care. We have kids! We don\u2019t have time to look good! And just to be clear, I\u2019m not hating on moms who struggle with getting dressed with little kids. Some days I cannot go to the bathroom until noon, much less put on makeup. But there are days when my kids let me have a few moments, and when that happens I make the most of it. And I get the distinct feeling that I\u2019m breaking the girl code of frumpy stay at home moms, and it\u2019s not going over well within the clique. Showing up to a play date with my hair styled and my face done (I\u2019m not talking anything fancy, just powder and mascara), and jeans and a cute shirt is enough to get stares. Wearing a skirt or dress? That\u2019s just extreme. \n\nSigh. My mom friends have been life savers, and I love that we all meet and build friendships in what would be an otherwise isolating life. Our mom groups are vital for us who stay at home. But it\u2019s tough to break the girl code.","title":"Dressing Femininely and Negative Reactions From Other Women","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ci2ubp\/dressing_femininely_and_negative_reactions_from\/"}

And when I think hard about women I've met, women I know, ect, it truly feels like your average woman *fears* the choices her man will or wont make in life. She's concerned about what will happen if her husband doesnt come to her for direction, permission, or advice. Shes afraid of him allowing the kids to eat pizza and ice cream for 3 days straight when she goes to visit her mom. Shes concerned that if she's not there he'll add too much laundry detergent (instead of reading the instructions like an adult ) and screw up the machine. Shes concerned that if she doesn't *loudly* vocalize their financial need for him to get that promotion that'll give him an extra 15k a year, he just won't go for it because he rarely goes for anything. Shes afraid every day. She's rarely comfortable. She's waiting for the next disaster that she'll have to slave over. And deep down, she thinks hes kinda stupid. I'm sure you know someone that honestly thinks her husband is stupid!\n\nNow. Who does that sound like? If you guessed a mommy with a rogue toddler, you're correct! Always vigilant, always terrified, always...NOSEY! \n\nSo obviously our number 1 issue becomes picking the appropriate man because plenty of men have just never gotten off of the mothers nipple. They have no ambitions. They're meek and easily discouraged. They watch other men feast then rush in to grab at any scraps that are left. They inspire *fear* in a woman. We know this man is a red flag so I wanna skip ahead to when you've chosen the right partner but still have flickers of fear because I'm sure a lot of us have dealt with someone like that at some point. And of course everyone has to be introspective and question what about them attracted a meek, unambitious man. (Loud bossy mouth? Masculine attitude? Willing to be the manly woman of the house?)\n\nAnd this is where the cheerleader vs soccer mom dichotomy comes in when you're in your happy relationship. And this has little to do with age, you can be a 19 year old soccer mom yelling at your bf to not be late for his shift and you can be a 40 year cheerleader that showers her man in compliments after he gets a great review at work.\n\nThe cheerleader, at her core, is cute, fun, lighthearted and encouraging. She bounces around, is *happy to be here*, and shes vocal with her support but quiets down once the match is on. She'll be right back out there with her pompoms when her man needs a pick me up and when he finally wins, she celebrates *him*. She doesnt celebrate the promotion, the review, or the boss that hired him. She celebrates *him.* She thanks him verbally and with action. \"You're so smart, baby!\" She rushes up to him and squeezes him and showers him in kisses. Yknow why? Because the cheerleader did her job and whether or not her team won, she did *her* job well. When the team is losing, the cheerleader doesn't rush out on the field to join the game! She knows that isnt her purpose! And most importantly of all, she *trusts* her man. A loss doesnt scare her because hes not a *loser.* He picks himself up, she assists in dusting him off, and right back out he goes. She's as supportive as he is reliable.\n\nSo our soccer mom is obviously the opposite of our cheerleader. Shes rough, she yells, shes scary, she chooses her mans goals for him because she doesnt think he has any common sense. At her core shes afraid, her self esteem is low, and she worries every night. She does not trust her man. She barely trusts herself. There is no encouragement, just shoving. When hes feeling down she berates him. If he wins, she *takes* the credit for it because she truly believes he wouldn't have wanted this if she didn't tell him to want it. \"Well yknow I'm the one that told him to go for the manager position in the first place!\" She also will skip over celebrating him to celebrate the win because she does not admire *him.* She admires the result of her nagging. \"Now we finally have enough money to go on vacation and get a new dryer!\" or \"Thank god Bill gave you the promotion over Harry!\" These are not compliments. They're damn near insults!\n\nAnd just like a real life soccer mom situation, there is no moment to relax and bask in his accomplishment for the man, because the next game is on sunday. Soccer mom has already picked out her mans next goal. Nobodys happy. Mom always wants more, kid starts to hate both mom and soccer. \n\nSo this is something I've noticed a lot of women struggle with. A womans trust is something super special and fragile, but if you logically know your man is worth it...butt out. Be a cheerleader. I had to learn how to shut up myself! Now if your mans decisions lead you to behave like a soccer mom out of fear for your own future and livelihood...is he really the man for you? And this dichotomy can be applied to a lot of issues. Alcohol, food, hygiene, sex, financial responsibility, ect. And ask yourself, \"Do I think he's kinda stupid?\" Be honest!\n\n If your mans unreliability scares you, hes not the one for you! But if you have a good man with a good head on his shoulders, trust him completely and without fear. And as always, if no one asked for your two cent, keep it!","title":"The Cheerleader vs The Soccer Mom and how to support your partner!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/chfcer\/the_cheerleader_vs_the_soccer_mom_and_how_to\/"}

This is what repels them from us.  i have been talking to men I know and the common theme is they WANT to do for us.  They are solvers, action takers. They want to make us happy, the want to solve our problems.  But they cant do that when we are battling them everyday.  They cant do that if we don't express what we truly want.\n\nWe  more than likely also have an inner child\/mother wound that is taking  over and creating emotional distance or conflicts in our interpersonal  relationships. This inner child is us as a baby, a child that still  carries around the hurt, the fear, the feeling of not being good  enough.\u00a0 That child peaks out and starts to make decisions for us, with the intention to protect us, but hurts us the most in the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Helena Hart\n\n[Http:\/\/helenahartcoaching.com](http:\/\/helenahartcoaching.com\/)\n\nHer  YouTube videos are awesome and so informative.

This is discussing the mother wound  which is deep for me. At first I was hesitant because she spoke in a  feminist way, but I let go of my bias and really listened to what she is  saying.\u00a0 She's on point.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Robin Reed\n\nHe has a YouTube video titled \"How to spot emotionally unavailable men\"\u00a0\n\nTrust me, just listen to him\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Dr. Gottman 7 Principles\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso check out Ted Talks on inner child, confidence, CBT techniques.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese  are all fascinating concepts and psychological theories.\u00a0 Take what you  want, discard what you don't need.\u00a0 Approach with an open mind.\u00a0 I hope  that this helps any woman that has been struggling with herself.

I was the girl with the buzz cut, nose ring, boy clothes, nasty attitude, 2 divorces, no college degree working in the restaurant industry, single 1\/2 time mom, and not awesome personal hygiene. So, what happened? Jeez.\n\nI met a man. Like, THE man. He is a man's man. He's a therapist, woodworker, fisherman, strong absurdly attractive fit American-Italian, ruthless honesty, integrity, leadership, a house, a boat, ALL of it. Like, the total package. He's 30 and never been married, no kids. And in spite of all the things above he picked me. The way he recounts it, he said he saw something special when I played music in front of him (the one place I had allowed my true feminine power to actually come out).\n\nI've been lurking this site for months. I've read The Surrendered Wife. I listen to Alison Armstrong like my life depends on it. I think the craziest thing is, by being with a man like him, I started naturally gravitating into becoming the woman I am today.\n\n It's like, I intuitively wanted to please and support him even though it went against EVERYTHING I grew up believing and had bought into. I slowly allowed him to be the Man (because he's the kind of man who essentially just commands that with his presence) and I naturally fell into becoming a woman. I'm completely sexually available, not from a place of obligation, but from pure joy. I dress and act feminine, even dyed my hair blond and lost 15 pounds. Took out the nose ring. Got a job at a law firm. I keep the home spotless. I support him at every turn without being critical. I am receptive to all of his gifts (even when they don't look the way I \"think\" they should) And the fucking insane part is how much I enjoy it. Like, I'm so happy. \n\nThere is still, however, this internal conflict that pops up. I suppose it's natural after living with rigid feminist ideologies for as long as I did. I started looking for answers and stumbled across Alison Armstrong, who explains the biologies of the sexes and how to work within that framework - and I was so ANGRY because she was so RIGHT! But, the evidence is clear. In my relationship. I didn't know LTR bliss like this existed. I didn't know just how much I was craving to be taken care of and to embrace the power within my femininity. These things may have become intuitive at some level, but I'm hungry for more.\n\nI'm starting to really grasp how much of a fluke it was that I landed the package deal, and I am determined to rise to the occasion. There is still that small SJW voice (He's not trying to be helpful, he's trying to insult you!) that tries to derail me, so I come here with an open-mind and mild apprehension.\n\nI've read these posts and you are some of the most caring, dedicated, supportive, considerate AND accountable, non-victim, courageous women I've ever seen. I am so inspired, and I'm committed to becoming the best version of myself and fully embracing all of these things that still seem amazing, but so foreign to me. I would be honored to be a part of this community and to learn and grow with you wonderful women.\n\nThat was a super round-a-bout way of introducing myself, but I want all of you to know just how excited I am that I have found my people!\n\n","title":"An almost hilarious transformation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6lwkfg\/an_almost_hilarious_transformation\/"}

He always says he is kidding when I confront him about it but it just doesn\u2019t feel like kidding to me. I am not overweight or out of shape, we go to the gym constantly.

Today for some reason it really got under my skin and I need advice on how to handle this. I don\u2019t care if he notices other women are attractive and I\u2019ve made that clear to him. It feels disrespectful to me that he does it. \nI would appreciate advice on how to handle this from now on! He does like to joke and has a very dry sense of humor, he always has with everyone. Am I overreacting? Though I consider myself attractive I may need to reevaluate and be really honest with myself.

I was feeling a bit down but most of all, my captain was ANNOYING me. As a result of these exacerbated feelings, I was a bit petty and less sweet than usual with him. It was worse than ever before, we've been together for 2.5 years and we're usually very loving with each other.\n\nWhen we started having sex again, my feelings and behavior changed drastically! Every time I looked at him I felt so in love and I even thought he looked better than the week before. I mean, this may have happened before to a certain extent but this time the change was so drastic that I really thought about it and I came to the conclusion that it was because of the sex. Of course, I was way more serviable and submissive because I naturally like to treat him. His behavior also changed with me. \n\nProof that it's really up to myself the way I'm treated by my man. When I'm sweet and nurturing, admirative and sexy, he gives it all back to me and we're both happy. The feminine power in setting the mood at home is really powerful.\n\nWhile doing some web browsing about this, I found a woman named Miranda Gray that wrote several books about women and one that is called \"Red moon\". I haven't read it and I don't know if I will, it may be a bit too much \"witchy\" for me but I liked the concept.\n\nBasically she says that our menstrual cycle has a direct influence on our mood (which I think is quite obvious for most of us) and that every phase has its own purpose and advantages that we can use in our favor.\n\nThe four phases are :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dynamic phase** (Maiden Goddess) approx days 7-13\n\nIn this phase, we can make things happen. Optimum time for mental focus, concentration, learning, physical stamina (basically getting s\\*\\* done)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Expressive phase** (Mother Goddess) approx 14-20\n\nThis should be the ovulation phase, what is considered feminine traits are most powerful during this phase. Optimum time for communication, empathy, supporting others, nurturing...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Creative phase** (Enchanting Goddess) approx 21-28\n\nBasically PMS. Apparently there is a positive side to it. It's the time to slow down. Optimum time for inspiration, out-of-the-box thinking, problem solving and assertiveness\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reflective phase** (Crone Goddess) approx 1-6\n\nPeriod. Optimum time for inner processing, creative reviewing, letting go, rest and renewal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found this quite interesting. I'm trying to keep in mind which phase I'm in this month (without changing anything in my habits). I'm supposed to be in the mother phase now :)\n\nI would love to hear what you ladies think about this !

As far as I know, this goes back to the creation of RPW. Take that as an indication that it\u2019s really important[.](https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/sXAVBqJw49RWaiAU8) \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFocusing on your partners flaws will only make them loom larger in your mind. It is also a way that we shift responsibility from ourselves (something we can fix) to him (something about which we can only wring our hands and clutch our pearls). Problems can only be fixed if you acknowledge your own role. The more negative things you have to say about your man, the more you will teach yourself to dislike him. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt goes further too. While I firmly believe that every woman should have a likeminded friend to confide in, if you spend too much of your time speaking ill of your partner, your friends and family will think ill of your partner. Your loved ones would be remiss to allow you to stay in a bad relationship with a bad man \u2013 so you see where this can cause problems to the long term stability of said relationship. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut hey, you love him, so that\u2019s not too hard. We might need a reminder from time to time, but all in all, a completely reasonable rule of life. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy challenge to you this week is to not bad mouth *men*. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow there are plenty of lurkers out there who will want to burn me in effigy for this. *RPW serves the male imperative* they will say. *I only follow my husband* others will say. *Have you BEEN to TRP* will get thrown in there.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I will elaborate. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI do not believe that men are the ideal specimens of humanity, so far above women that we must bow before them. I\u2019m also not advising you to defer to any man in the room simply for being male. The male imperative is often in opposition to ours, a fact that is evident if you visit the male subs. It\u2019s not a secret to women over the age of 16 that men will say whatever they must to get in our pants, commitment is optional (*my husband once swore to me that mosquitos do not like still water in an attempt to con my pants off*). *So why do we not discuss these things more on RPW*? you may wonder. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou are the sum of your thoughts and your actions. If you spend all day thinking how terrible men are, it will be difficult to turn off and engage lightheartedly with your partner. If you are always waiting to mistrust men, men will pick up on that and they won\u2019t pick you up. If you spend your time discussing how all men are fuckboys and players then you are more likely to self sabotage by finding fuckboys and players. And if you come to RPW and talk about how you are surrounded by betas, then all you are going ever find are negative beta traits (*an aside: beta traits - not a bad thing. I\u2019m so tired of hearing \u2018beta\u2019 as a pejorative. Leave that insult to the men. Ladies, we require beta traits if we want commitment and\/or family*). Cognitive behavior therapy has been built and prospered around the idea of controlling your thoughts to your own benefit. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[We do not need to be bitter and angry]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M). You cannot be a soft place to land if you have a permanent scowl on your face or if you are always on edge waiting for a man to do you wrong. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I am not suggesting is a wide eyed naivete. Life is full of risks that we must do our best to mitigate. Use your brain. If you feel too emotional to make a good decision, move away from the situation. Vet your men well, do not believe what you are told if it\u2019s not followed by action and don\u2019t believe what you are told if it defies logic (*lest you end up covered in mosquito bites*). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut don\u2019t badmouth men. It conditions your brain to be negative and keeps you anxious in your interactions. Even if you don\u2019t give a flip about men in general, that\u2019s not a healthy way for *you* to go through life. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBesides, you\u2019d be so much prettier if you smiled. \n\n***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Happy talk, keep talking happy talk.

She makes these gorgeous YouTube videos (\\~6.5M subscribers) showing her traditional rural life on a homestead in China. She does everything with such feminine grace, I thought you ladies would appreciate her example of a modern feminine renaissance woman.\n\nI wasn't sure which video to post so here's [Liziqi's YouTube Channel](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCoC47do520os_4DBMEFGg4A), and here's [the video I first saw](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UvmC-leoj9U&t=25s) that got me hooked on her.\n\nHer videos show such a range of homemaking talents...plenty of mouthwatering traditional Chinese recipes (her father was a chef), but she also makes her own makeup, designs\/sews\/embroiders her own dresses and shoes, builds her own furniture, even brews her own beer. She grows everything herself (from rice to silkworms) and makes everything from scratch using traditional (even ancient) Chinese methods (she builds with hand tools and her kitchen stove is wood burning).\n\nPeople often think she is an actress on a set. But not only does she make everything in her videos herself (as her rough hands can attest to), she's her own filmmaker who directs, shoots and edits everything herself. She started out shooting and editing on an iPhone. In one video where she was making noodles, she had to keep remaking the noodles over and over again because they would dry out in the time it took her to set up each shot. Eventually she was able to buy a digital SLR and hire a cameraman (it was taking her 3-4 months per video), but she still directs all the shots and final edits herself. Her videos are so peaceful to watch and her production level is like something you'd find in a BBC documentary. I have so much respect for the dedication it takes to get that level of quality!\n\nShe's an example of a woman who is strong, independent yet totally feminine. All the comments are gushing about how any man would be honored to be with her. (Haven't come across anything about her romantic life other than the fact that she is single). Her backstory is like something from a Disney fairytale, complete with an evil stepmother before she was orphaned. She worked a hard life in the city, sleeping on park benches and working in everything from waitressing to DJing. When her grandfather died she returned to the country to care for her grandmother and started making videos to help sell her handmade products. And while she lives on a rural farm (in what most people would consider poverty conditions) everyone calls her a princess of China. She's my new woman-crush and has also inspired me to reconnect with my Chinese heritage.

There have been a couple of posts lately about specific traits that make a woman commitment-worthy (ie that contribute to your Relationship Market Value, or RMV), not just date-worthy or sex-worthy (Sexual Market Value, SMV), in the eyes of a quality man. \n\nI think lots of new RPW get caught up in the surface trappings that improve their SMV (like longer hair, wearing more dresses, and baking more). But what are the things men consider important when looking for a commitment-worthy partner? \n\nThis post is adapted from a long reply I wrote in a locked thread. I'd love to hear further suggestions. \n\n\n*  Being polite and non-argumentative in public and in private. No one wants to feel like they're being argued at. This is especially important for RMV because you need to be a strong team if you're considering having children.\n\n*  Attitude towards children\/skills appropriate for motherhood. Many men, even the ones who don't want children now, watch women for signs that a woman would be a good mother. That means kindness, honesty, consideration of other people's needs, as well as actually being interested in having kids (if relevant).\n\n*  Ability to maintain close relationships with friends and family. This doesn't mean having 15 acquaintances you see each week for drinks, it means having a couple of close friends that you can turn to when you need tough love (for example, when you're having trouble dating) and who you're there for in their time of need. Family is obviously more tricky (you only get one, and sometimes they're not worth having a relationship with), but most men will understand if you don't have a relationship with your family (if it's for a good reason) as long as you've demonstrated the ability to maintain close friendships. Being able to maintain long-term close relationships is a sign of loyalty, a key trait in romantic relationships.\n\n\n*  Being considerate of other people's needs. This means their ACTUAL needs, not what you *think* their needs are. Sometimes a man needs quiet, alone time. Sometimes he needs to feel like a king in his own home. Sometimes (often) he needs a steak and a BJ. Sometimes he needs home baking! \n\n*  Being aware in social situations. This means 'reading the room', noticing when people are getting stressed\/reactive, and smoothing things over where possible. An example of this: I had to go to a family function last weekend, and I was upset\/frustrated for a couple of reasons (I tried to keep it hidden but I wasn't doing the best at it). My aunt, at the event, noticed I was upset and gave me a cup of tea and distracted me by asking about my latest home improvement activity. She 'read' my emotional state and helped improve it, a great skill. \n\n*  Being respectful and socially appropriate in public. A man doesn't get shamed when his FWB is obnoxious at a party, but a husband will absolutely be ashamed if his wife is playing up (getting drunk, or long-winded) and making people bored\/uncomfortable. For an example, consider the Bennet sisters from Pride and Prejudice (a classic, and relatively easy to read if you haven't already). At a social situation, Kitty and Lydia were giddily flirting and acting like sexed-up teenagers. Mary was at the opposite end of the spectrum, being boring and stuffy and making everyone listen to her singing. In contrast, Jane and Elizabeth were making polite conversation, listening to the people around them, and participating in the dance. Who ended up pumped-and-dumped by an officer? Who ended up the last daughter left at home and single? And who ended up married to good men? \n\n* Flexibility to listen and change your view when new information appears.  By being open to change and learning, you show that you're a good partner and team-mate. Example: my husband wanted a particular breed of dog. I was worried because everything I read on the internet indicated that this breed of dog is high exercise - and we don't exercise that much, especially not in dog-friendly ways (ie not the gym). BUT: I was open to learning and changing my view, and after talking to a huge number of dog owners of this breed, going to dog shows, etc, I came to agree with him, and we're getting the dog :)\n\n* Ability to self-analyse and self-improve. This doesn't just mean the surface stuff, like 'lose two points of BMI' or 'be better at baking', this means honestly reflecting on your life (including work, relationships, and other endeavours) and identifying your flaws, and then working to resolve them. Whether this means journalling, therapy or simply talking to a good friend about how you can improve, being open to change and growth is important over the life of a relationship. \n\n\n*  Being interested in HIM, not just wanting a relationship. Men can tell when you're just trying to find someone to marry, rather than being interested in them as a human. Are you interested in HIS opinions, HIS activities, HIS life? It's not about you wanting a relationship, it's about you wanting HIM, and he can damn well tell if you're just playing the field. Most men would prefer a 6-7 who thought he was a god to a 9-10 who thought he was okay. \n\nI'm most definitely not perfect, and struggle with some of these even now! I'd love to hear what other traits you think are important to RMV, compared to SMV.

It's a little bit of history and a little bit about my recent changes, but I'm not writing this for you to get to know me. I'm writing because I was always a \"smart girl\" and when I found RP, I quickly thought I had it all figured out. Swallowing the red pill made me feel special. I was enlightened and everything was going to get better. It was a great feeling. I'd learned which lessons were important, which parts applied to me, which things I should implement in my life. \n\nExcept I was wrong. \n\nBecause I'm not smarter than RP. You're not smarter than RP. RP isn't a list of things that you get to pick and choose from, and it's a much larger life-shift than I ever imagined. The last few months and weeks have been a humbling experience and if anyone can learn from my thoughts at the time, then it was worth writing this out. \n\n--\n\nWe were waiting in line to get on the plane. I was nervous and fidgeting. \"We should have started boarding 8 minutes ago. Not a good sign.\"\n\n\"Relax. Everything will be fine.\" C put his arm around my shoulders. \"Relax.\"\n\n\"Good evening everyone. Unfortunately our crew is arriving on a delayed aircraft. We will begin boarding as soon as they arrive and can perform their safety checks.\"\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\n\"I think it'll be fine.\"\n\n\"Well, we're clearly not leaving on time. We only have 39 minutes for our layover and who knows how far away the next gate will be, fuck fuck fuck. This fucking sucks.\"\n\n\"I really think it'll be fine if you just relax.\" The annoyance that I was all too familiar with had started creeping into his voice.\n\nI shut up, a sour look on my face, grumbling in my head. We were not fine. This was not fine. We were going to miss our connection and then we'd get there late and...\n\nAnd what? We'd have a few less hours to spend with his parents? We had intentionally not scheduled anything important early in the day in case something just like this happened. Our worst case was almost equivalent to our best case scenario, and this had me so freaked out that I was swearing at C? I took a deep breath.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Folks, I'm happy to say that the crew has just cleared the plane and we're ready to begin the boarding process.\"\n\nYup. That was definitely worth being a whiny brat over.\n\n--\n\nLast November was a high point in my life that I thought was only going to get better. My boyfriend, now fiance, and I had just returned from an amazing overseas trip where he'd proposed. There were lots of wedding plans and decisions to make and I was so excited to get to the end of the aisle that the warning signs we'd dealt with at the beginning of our relationship went unnoticed. But after a big blowout on New Year's Eve, our issues became too big for me to ignore. \n\nThat made January a low point in my life that I wasn't really sure would ever get better. My fiance, C, had been blunt with me. The person I was acting like wasn't the person he was signing up to marry. I took that... poorly, and spent another few weeks in a downward self-destructive spiral. I spent a lot of time on the internet, largely looking for like-minded souls to commiserate with. I found RedPillWomen instead. \n\n--\n\nMy identity growing up had quickly formed around the idea of being \"the smart girl\". Early schooling was filled with praise for my good grades and test scores. I learned that I could get everything I needed out of life simply by being intelligent. It was a heady feeling. I wasn't fitting in with the kids at school, but by god was I smart. I clung to that. I was smarter, I was better, I was going to show them all.\n\nI went to college to study engineering. That was what smart girls did - we needed more girls in STEM - and I was a smart girl. It certainly felt better than high school. I met other smart girls. I felt included in their club. We were going to take over the world. I found a guy willing to put up with my shit. The problem hadn't been me. It had been them, and now I had finally snagged one of the good ones.\n\nCollege ended. I \"found myself\" - for realsies this time I swear - in the real world at my first big girl engineering job. I decided that my \"good\" boyfriend wasn't good enough and let him know where he needed to brush up. After a year of constant conflict, we brushed each other out of our lives. Suddenly I was alone. Still smart, I told myself, but very, very alone. \n\n--\n\nC and I worked together, and he had an air of confidence that I wasn't used to. I liked it and wanted him to end my loneliness. I attempted to rise to his challenges at work, to prove to him I was one of the guys, that I was just as smart as he was. He didn't seem to care. Then one day I wore a dress. He stopped by my office to chat. I wore another dress. We had a date the next week.\n\nHe was upfront from the start about what he wanted and what his expectations of me were. Sure, I thought, that's what he thinks he wants. He'll learn that I'm special. I didn't change a thing, at least when he wasn't looking. Then he caught me in a lie. He got mad, but I only felt his disappointment. I spent the next week nauseated until he informed me that I had another chance. One other chance. I took it. I stopped lying and started trying to actually take his expectations to heart. Things improved. Life improved. I started questioning many of the choices I'd made, many of the choices my fellow \"smart women\" had made in the name of independence and equality. I told C that maybe I would be okay staying home with the children, that maybe our future family was a higher priority than my intelligence saving the world. He smiled. That brought us to the proposal last October.\n\n--\n\n\"But we can do it this weekend, right?\"\u000b\n\"Let's discuss this later.\"\n\n\"I just want to know so I can stop worrying about it.\"\u000b\u000b\"You don't have to worry about it, it's my job to worry about it and I've got it under control.\"\n\nI started crying.\n\n\"Why are you crying?\"\u000b\n\"I'm sorry I'm just anxious and I just wanted to know and now you're being mean to me.\"\n\nHe walked out of the room.\n\nMy tears stopped and my hamster started. I was fuming. It was New Year's Eve, we were supposed to be celebrating, and he had retreated to our bedroom. What was wrong with wanting to know about a plan in advance, for crying out loud.\n\nThe night only got worse and the plans I'd been looking forward to for weeks never materialized. It was the worst New Year's Eve I've ever had.\n\n--\n\nBy that March I'd found RedPillWomen and received quite the wake-up call. Everything I read rang true, and explained both C's attitude and the entire course of our relationship. C was RP, though not in so many words, and while I'd started wearing dresses and now owned hair and make-up products and was okay giving up my job to stay with the kids\u2026 my attitude still needed an adjustment. I was still coming from a place of being a \"smart girl\" who knew everything. It turns out that there was a lot more \"everything\" to learn. \n\nI'm going to jump ahead to the story that I started this post with, because this has gotten way long and unfortunately that conversation was just this past weekend.\n\nIt's not that I haven't been trying, and C would admit that. It's even been working, for the most part. Our sex life has bounced back since I committed to making him my priority. We've been having home-cooked meals most of the time and I lost the few pounds that had creeped up on me. My mantra became \"soft\" - softer in voice, softer in my actions, be his soft place to land. In a lot of ways, I've really taken the RP mindset to heart.\n\nAnd yet here I was swearing at him in the airport because our flight was fifteen minutes delayed.\n\n--\n\nThen I read Delphine's post. She quoted a line from her husband and it stopped me in my tracks.\n\n> Do you trust me? If you trust me, why are you arguing with me? Do you not think that I will do what is right by us? We are about to be married. Trust me.\n\nIt encouraged me to make an account and come out of lurkdom. I wanted more of this attitude, more of this mindset. I hung out in the RPW chat some. And then I realized that while I've been sucking on the pill for months, I had yet to fully swallow it. \n\nThe red pill is a bitter one to swallow and the bitterness is going to be a shitty aftertaste in your mouth for a while. It doesn't go away the second you swallow. That bears repeating. Swallowing the pill is actually the easy part. Knowing you need to change is not the same as changing. Heck, the more I change, the more things I learn I need to change. Turns out RP isn't just about fixing up the outside of your life. It's great if your house looks lovely, but it's a much greater reward when the fighting inside stops.\n\nOur fighting hasn't stopped because I haven't stopped fighting for control.\n\n--\n\nI don't trust my fiance. There, I said it. I want to. I'm working on it. But I don't, right now. That's why I was swearing in the airport, as much as I don't like to admit it. I even wanted to start this paragraph with \"Sometimes I don't trust my fiance,\" but that's not accurate. Trust isn't a sometimes thing, just like RP isn't a sometimes thing. It sucks, it really does, but you don't get to pause it when it's inconvenient. I don't get to pause when I'm pissed off, when I'm anxious. And right now I am those things a lot and it is hard to give up control and just trust.\n\nChanging my brain to the RP mindset has become somewhat of a full-time job. I feel sometimes that I don't really have time for it, what with my \"real\" full-time job. Then I remind myself that if I want to have a lot of free time, I can keep acting like I have been. Pretty sure C would leave and I'd be a freeeee woman. Which is totally exactly what I want.\n\n--\n\nSo here's what I came to say. Swallow the red pill. Don't do it because I said so, do it because you're a smart woman who's been reading here and wants to see something different in her life. It's well worth the rewards that everyone else has mentioned. \n\nJust don't forget and be too smart to actually swallow the whole thing. If it's not bitter, you're probably not there yet. There's a lot of hard work ahead, for you and me both.\n\nWe need to share our stories and these experiences with one another. Don\u2019t be content with simply reading and lurking, take a chance and tell your story, we\u2019re here to listen, help, and learn together.\n","title":"Thinking I'm smarter than RP was one of my dumbest moves yet...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2fwqmy\/thinking_im_smarter_than_rp_was_one_of_my_dumbest\/"}

Once that church had dispensed he has committed to attending another church weekly. He has always given faithfully to the church and has supported various missions. He is also sponsoring a child.\n\nAfter I met him; His commitments did not change. Since before we were engaged he brought me along to his church and introduced me to his church family. He has supported me in supporting the missions I am involved in financially and also agreed with my request for us to contribute more to the church. He has continued sponsoring a child (which he did not advertise to me, but I noticed when I saw a letter from world vision).\n\nNow we are married; We attend church weekly together. Every night in bed he reads his bible next to me before we sleep. He also has a YouTube channel where he creates sermon jams. \n\n\u2022He has never over promised or broken a promise.\n\nThe first time I met my husband he kissed me on the cheek and opened the car door for me, the door swung back and closed, but by that time he was half way around the car. He cringed hard and tried to brush it off. \n\nFrom that first meeting forward he always opened my car door when coming to pick me up and closed it behind me. I would always giggle and insist he never had to do that and it was ridiculous to keep up, but on this occasion and on many he said \u201cI\u2019ll never do anything for you that I can\u2019t keep up.\u201d And it was true. \n\nHe never over promised, he never over extended, he never spoilt me to woo me in the beginning then became tight later on. His spending, his actions towards me and his love for me never spiked then fell. He opened up the car door for me until we got married and started living together, so I open up my car door now (partly on my insistence, haha). After becoming ill and battling chronic illness, he started opening the door for me again when I was too weak. This is a small example of how he has stayed consistent.\n\n\u2022He doesn\u2019t lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences.\n\nI always used to joke with my husband \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just lie to me?! I don\u2019t want to know!\u201d  When he told me things I did not want to hear. I was joking, partly, as my sinfulness wanted an easy life and a man that told me what I wanted.\n\nWell, through God\u2019s grace to me, I\u2019m married to a man that is so honest to me, sometimes it is confrontational. He doesn\u2019t like above the knee jean shorts, he thinks they\u2019re hideous. He doesn\u2019t like t-shirt dresses, he thinks they\u2019re equally hideous (two things I wore often), he doesn\u2019t like long skirts on me, he doesn\u2019t like short hair etc...etc... it might sound picky, but it\u2019s directional and in going against what he\u2019s said, that would be the true confrontation. It is unloving to do something you know your partner does not like.\n\nMy husband spoke to me and suggested we go shopping. He encouraged me to dress like some of the girls my age and that how they dress would suit me a lot (can you imagine hearing this without a humble heart?) but he has never brought something up without his support and means to fix the issue. So, he takes me shopping. \u201cWow, look at my hot fianc\u00e9!\u201d (We we\u2019re engaged at the time) it made me feel admired and loved, it was amazing to see his reaction and how happy he was every time I skipped out to his car wearing the clothes he bought me. In saying that, we didn\u2019t buy anything I wasn\u2019t comfortable in, a few pairs of jeans, white sneakers, multiple t shirts of the same colour- so simple but he loved it, and I loved him even more for telling me. I\u2019ve bought many husband approved dresses since, which he adores.\n\n\n\u2022He has clear standards for me. He introduced me to his friends, family and church. \n\nIn his vetting process of me, he let me have his \u201creal\u201d personality from the beginning. He made things clear how he liked it and as we interacted with other couples, we saw real life examples of how we would and wouldn\u2019t want to be like. \n\nCouple A- My husband is friends with the husband. He can\u2019t stand the wife. She\u2019s overweight, unkind and screams at her husband in public. My hubby was very clear at his distain for her and never pretended to like her even in front of her. He was blunt and didn\u2019t go out of his way to acknowledge her. It was clear he did not respect her. I never wanted that to be me.\n\nCouple B- My husband did ministry for a long time with the husband of this couple. His wife was sweet, feminine and absolutely lovely. She was kind and warm to me when I was an outsider in the group. She was respectful of her husband and it showed in everything they did together. She was thin and dressed well. My husband enjoyed our time a lot with this couple and told me how much he respected their relationship. He would say things like \u201cthey\u2019re the real deal\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing she\u2019s kept in shape so well after having a child\u201d \n\nBy this feedback, and seeing how he treated these different types of people, and on top of that, knowing how consistent he is as a person, I knew how not to act. \n\n\u2022His health\/ my health \n\nHe has made it clear that cooking at home needs to be healthy. My husband goes to the gym 5-6 days a week and eats the same thing for lunch everyday. I would push him sometimes for him to let me prepare him lunch, but he insistent that is what he will eat everyday and it is what is best for his health. \n\nWe go shopping together and buy the food I will cook together. I buy ingredients he likes and ingredients that are healthy. He has told me he wants veggies in his diet, so that\u2019s what I cook. He wants high protein meals, so that\u2019s what I cook. I make sure I have the ingredients for all the meals he could want (to a point) so he has the freedom to ask for what he wants for dinner.  \n\nHe has made what he wants clear. He does not allow us to eat take away more than once a week. He is hyper aware of his body (I always catch him tensing in front of the mirror, haha) and is hyper aware of my body. He\u2019s made it clear he does not want me to gain any weight and that the weight I am right now is the largest he would like me (I\u2019m 58kg, 5\u201d4) he has also found the most hilarious way to let me know I\u2019m gaining weight  \u201cwow honey, look how big your breasts are!\u201d Makes me laugh thinking about it. With his help, I\u2019ve stayed pretty much the same weight since meeting him. \n\n\n\u2022He takes care of me and brings me security \n\nFinancial security; My husband sought to get a stable job and savings before he put himself on the market to be married. By the time I met him, he had a deposit saved for a house and a job that was recession proof. He made it clear to me that is getting a house together would require me working full time until we were ready for kids. He told me it would be difficult and that he would support me in this. \n\nGod provided me a job that is close to home and my husband drives me every morning. (Currently not working due to COVID)\n\nHealth; during our engagement I had a trip to the ER. It turned out I had a cyst on my ovary, we did not realise the health hurdles we would be tackling in the next year and a half because of it. 5 more trips to the ER, specialist and doctors appointments, IUD insertions and a surgery later, I\u2019m still on the mend and take pain killers to manage in the meantime. This is a chronic condition called endometriosis. I never, ever expected my husband to be so supportive and unconditionally loyal. \n\nI remember on one trip to the hospital I was passing out in the passengers seat and vomiting. In my moments of consciousness I looked to my husband and he kept saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry baby, we are almost there, it\u2019s going to be ok\u201d.\n\nI trusted him and let the anxiety go. It\u2019s a blurr but I ended up in a hospital bed getting emergency pain relief. He waited with me in the hospital the entire day. This happened quiet a few more times. After my operation I went back to the ER and we waited in the horrible waiting room chairs for 8 hours through the early hours of the morning. Everytime I looked at him I wanted to cry out of gratitude, I felt so horrid and he was right there with me. I can not believe the level of empathy and maturity he has shown to me when I was in 10\/10 pain.\n\nIn my moments of absolute weakness and exhaustion, so much so I couldn\u2019t cry out to God, he would put his hand on me and pray for me.\n\n\u2022He puts me first before his family.\n\nWe come from a traditional culture where the mothers tend to baby their sons. I love my MIL to death and I don\u2019t mind her asking questions, but my husband without hesitation always shuts everyone down if they question how I am at home. \n\n\u201cDoes Anna cook for you everyday?\u201d He will respond along the lines of \u201cwhy does it matter? She can do as she likes she\u2019s the cook of the home.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, poor Anna, she can\u2019t speak our language\u201d he will respond \u201cwhat do you mean poor Anna? She\u2019s a lion. You should be the one learning English.\u201d\n\nHe will shut down any conversation that is not kind to me, he does not complain about me to his family nor friends. He will not let his friends joke about our sex life.\n\nHe does not let me overextend myself for the sake of his family even though I am extremely willing to. He tells me and has the strong belief that our immediate family unit (him and me) are most important and everything else is secondary. We of course love his family a lot, especially his parents, but he\u2019s made it clear we won\u2019t partake in anything just for the sake of tradition. \n\nBonus points:\n\n-He gets along amazingly with my Dad, we all hang out all the time and it\u2019s the best part of my life! \n\n-His family love me (they joke constantly they love me more than they love him!)\n \n-He is good with children and loves his nephews, we even baby set sometimes.\n\n-He grew his beard for me.","title":"Why I love my husband","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ga4zsx\/why_i_love_my_husband\/"}

He usually wakes up at noon since it's his vacation, but it was already 3PM, he hasn't replied to me asking when he'd come over. We were going to have a fancy lunch at my place and since I cook, I need to know when I should start, so it's just done by the time he arrives (pesky \"gotta eat the food hot\" complex) i'm also notorious for getting things and making them right away, because he won't eat protein that's been in the fridge for more than 24h, so looking at fresh beef filets withering away is making me more and more anxious. So I wait for another hour and then I get a quick reply of \"dunno, make the food tomorrow\". I was about to go into interrogation mode \"why? Couldn't you have told me this earlier? But you said yesterday we'd have lunch today!\" Instead of all that I just put down the phone and rationalized, replied with a genuine \"no worries! Are you okay?\".\n\nTurns out he was feeling really sick and was up all night because of his coughs. He came over looking like a snowman, nose running and feverish. \nImagine feeling this bad and getting an unnecessary temper tantrum from your girlfriend. What a nightmare! We spent the night together, I made him soup and gave him a massage, looking at him having this heartwarming smile on his face and it was honestly one of the most intimate moments we shared. \n\nAgain I hope you didn't expect anything spectacular, I just feel like this tiny tiny slipup could've obliterated this experience and it would have never turned out to be such a great night if I hadn't bitten my tongue over this minuscule thing.","title":"Biting your tongue - a lifesaver","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/eqvust\/biting_your_tongue_a_lifesaver\/"}

Unfortunately for those of you looking for your Ultimate Checklist, life is a bit more nuanced than that. \n\nThese types of posts always bring about a lot of discussion because people have different experiences. Some women found their high value man having only a high school education and working as a waitress. Good for them! Others only found their high value man once they had a master's degree and luctarive career. You go, girl! But what this means for everyone reading and commenting here is that there isn't one single list of things that every high value man cares about, because there is no one, objective High Value Man. \n\nAre there *objectively* high value men? Yes, of course they are. Nobody would dispute that a high-ranking politician, a world-renowned actor, or a CEO of a multi-million dollar company are high-value men. But for most people reading posts here, these types of men aren't attainable. And even in this list of men who would be objectively high value, there is still a huge amount of difference between them -- the kind of woman a politican would like to marry is likely quite different from the kind of woman a celebrity would like to marry.\n\n**A man can't fuck your law degree: the difference bewteen SMV and RMV**\n\nOne of the things discussed frequently here is the fact that men don't care about your career or your personal achievements. And on some level, yes, this is true. That level is the level of SMV -- the sexual attraction you inspire in a man. Trying to get a man to notice you involves looking nice and acting pleasant, it doesn't involve waving your CV in their face. Imagine if a man tried to get you attention by constantly talking about how well he can cook and take care of children. That's all well and good, and you may find that impressive (who wouldn't want a delicious meal, after all?), but I highly doubt most of you would be desperate to rip your clothes off as he drives you to his appartment in his sensible minivan in order to cook you a meal and look at pictures of cute babies. Why? Because this man is trying to inspire *sexual* attraction using things that are really only important once in a long-term relationship (and not in every LTR, either). This is what a woman does when she tries to snag a man by talking about how she earns six figures and went to top universities. That's all well and good, and a man may find that impressive, but the first stages of courting and attraction begin in the genitals, and no matter how many *cum laude* degrees you have from Harvard and Oxford, that's not going to make anybody's dick hard. \n\nSo yes, if you want to attract a man, being beautiful and feminine, open, warm, and approachable is pretty much the basis of what you need. But nobody is here just to learn how to *attract* a man. That part is pretty easy. What we need is to know how to *keep* that man -- and that's where things start to get more tricky, and where what you bring to a relationship (aka, your RMV, aka that fancy PhD in astrophysics) comes into play. \n\n**Know the type of man you want, and know the type of woman that man is looking for**\n\nEveryone doesn't have the same idea in their head of a \"high value man\". I'm sure some people would look at my boyfriend and think, \"I'd never go for that!\", just as I look at some people's partners and think the same thing. That's because even though at a very base level women want similar things (protection, security, love) we have different tastes, different interests, and different goals in life. A woman who's childfree and loves to travel is not going to be happy with a hard-working family man, and a woman who wants to be a homemaker with many children isn't going to be happy with a man who travels a lot for work and doesn't make enough money to support a family of five on his own.\n\nBut these big disparities aren't the only ones to keep in mind. Want to be in a relationship with a highly-educated professor? He's going to want someone he can have intelligent conversations with, who will hold her own among his peers during gathers. Does this mean you need to have a PhD? No, but it does mean that, for this kind of man, your education *is* important and if you want a relationship, your academic \"credentials\" will be taken into account. Likewise, it's been brought up a few times that business owners, lawyers, doctors, and other people with high-ranking careers often look for a partner who can match up to them. No, you don't need to be a lawyer to date a lawyer, but it's pretty unlikely that someone who's got a lot more opportunities to meet women who are both accomplished *and* beautiful is going to settle for someone who brings significantly less to the table. Beauty and femininity are good and important, but they are not the only traits a man is going to consider when picking a partner. After all, just as a man is more than a wallet to women, a woman is more than a vagina to a man. Both parties are picking a partner, and different men are going to have different needs.\n\nSo rememeber, if you're interested in the high-ranking career man, it may not be impossible to get him if you're a high school educated waitress, but it will be more difficult. Don't just think about everything you bring to the table when looking for a partner -- remember that different sets of men have different requirements as well. And if you're looking for a specific type of man, you need to be the specific type of woman he needs. \n\nLet's close off with some anecdotes:\n\nMy cousin is probably what most people would consider \"objectively high value\" (lucrative career in finance, high earning, etc). His wife is a CFO. \n\nAnother cousin is an engineer. Her husband is also an engineer. \n\nMy best friend is a lawyer. Her long-term boyfriend has a PhD and lucrative STEM career. \n\nMy friends in academia are all dating or married to other academics\/educators. \n\nMy friend who works as a caregiver for the elderly is dating a very lovely veterinary technician. High-ranking, high-earning careers? Nope! But that's not what either of them were considering when picking a partner.

He is laid back and not overly controlling.  This used to frustrate me because how was I supposed to be submissive if he wasn't giving me specific orders and desires to submit to?  Why couldn't he just tell me what he wanted for dinner so I could submissively cook it for him?  Why wouldn't he decide what we should do on a Friday night so I could submissively go along with it?  Ohh, how frustrated I was getting.\n\nThen I realized that there is a difference between being laid back and passive, and a difference between being controlling and in charge.  The problem is never that my man is willing to eat whatever I feel inspired to cook without his input, or that he is happy to delight me by considering whatever would make me happy on a Friday night.  There certainly would be a problem that comes from ME if he did express a preference and I did not defer to it.  But absent of that, there is no problem in our relationship dynamic unless I create one, which is entirely possible if you consider how emasculating and demoralizing it is when a man gets criticized by his woman for not being more decisive.  Getting frustrated with your man for being laid back (and therefore \"not manly enough\") is going to undermine the very thing you're after, and it's very disrespectful to him anyway.\n\nInstead of getting frustrated when he is willing to go along with whatever you decide, THANK HIM.  Thank him for allowing you to do whatever makes your little heart happy.  Seeing his indifference towards decisions like these in a frustrating light just means YOU ARE PERPETUATING THE POWER STRUGGLE, and a sign that you have so much more letting go to do.  This work is on you, not him.\n\nIn other words, don't try to subtly (or not so subtly) dominate him into being more dominant.  Your job is not to teach him how to be a better man.  Make yourself a better woman and leave him alone.  Accept that you have an awesomely laid back man and be sure to defer to him when he does have an idea, plan, or preference.

I grew up southeast Asian, and it\u2019s a big part of my culture to be RP. I\u2019ve seen it work amazingly for so many people and their marriages, arranged or otherwise. \n\nTwo months ago, my husband quit his job at a local restaurant where he was being abused by the owner. I fully stood by him and supported him in this decision, even though I told him to find alternative employment before he quit. The abuse got to be too much, and he was unable to find another position before quitting his serving job. He spiraled into a deep depression. I worked a pretty good job then and we had some savings, and I encouraged him to get healthy and do his best so he could potentially give his next job everything he\u2019s got and be the hardest worker he can be. \n\nFast forward to today, I got fired today due to having a procedure done and taking some time off to recover. It\u2019s not unheard of for the hospital I work at to fire staff who are out sick, and while I thought I had supportive bosses, I was lied to and lost my job when I was assured I wouldn\u2019t. I have been begging and consistently asking my husband to apply for jobs for the past two months, and now that neither one of us are employed, our savings are going to be depleted further, and it definitely gives me so much anxiety not knowing what our next week is going to look like.

I\u2019m exhausted and so done with feeling like I have to beg him for every single thing that is traditionally his responsibility while trying to shoulder my own responsibilities, full time job, and nursing school. I\u2019m so lost. \n\nAddressing this with my husband makes him extremely defensive and he gets verbally a little aggressive with me. Nothing abusive, just rude. It\u2019s really been tearing into me and I feel like I\u2019m in a corner, and my dreams of having a home I can be proud of and slowly fading away.\n\nEdit: he\u2019s finishing university so he can attend grad school in January, but hasn\u2019t been attending classes recently\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!","title":"My husband doesn\u2019t want to get a job","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/x4m9ob\/my_husband_doesnt_want_to_get_a_job\/"}

Looking back, this question gets posted constantly and always has the same kinds of vague responses: even men in good relationships won't be vulnerable because, in the past, it either gives women the \"ick\" right then and there, or the woman immediately makes it about her, or it's used as ammunition in a fight down the road. I always read these threads in full because I've never reacted this way to displays of male emotion (that I know of, and this is key) and I'm combing through the threads for examples of what these scenarios look like. The male respondents never give examples because presumably the subject of their vulnerability is deeply personal. Men will say that \"women reading this act like they have no idea what we're talking about, but chances are they've been the perpetrator without knowing it.\"\n\nSo I'm done with trying to get the male perspective on this, and I'm ready to hear it from women who like to think about their past and present relationships: do you have any regrets over how you handled certain situations that fit this description? Or are these men misunderstanding something about how and when to share their emotions? For example, maybe they're dumping emotions too early on, or maybe they are acting insecure and trying to make it their partner's problem. Maybe they were hiding a serious red flag that they were ashamed of and the woman is acting appropriately?\n\nI'm inclined to accept that this is a widespread issue that men face, which makes me want to identify small instances of it that might be eroding my intimacy with my partner or avoid future instances. For example, I have to force myself to lay low when I can tell my partner is tired and doesn't want to talk, even though my impulse is to make up for his lack of communication. If I allowed myself to get frustrated by this, it might be a case of overlooking his emotional needs to return to the level of attention I'm used to.

Women often have a tendency to become defensive when told to \"dress your age\".\n\nWe don't give the same advice to men, we make fun of men who are 35 for wearing skate shoes and trucker hats because we know that dressing like a teenager in your 30s looks ridiculous, but we shield women from any criticism in this department which doesn't help women.  Especially women who have social deficits and require more direct messages to understand these things (I'm a high functioning autistic, learning this took me a while.  We as a society tend to be less direct with women to spare their feelings).\n\nI'm going to share with you the things that I have learned.\n\nI had an aha moment when my husband took photographs of me and I just looked horrible in my outfits.  I was still dressing the same way I did at 16 throw in a few current trends and things I had clung onto over the years.  It made me go out and buy a new wardrobe. I laughed and joked about it but deep down I was embarrassed that I ever looked that way in public.\n\nI learned that my body type is an apple and I learned what was flattering for me.  I'm also petite (159cm) and very busty with some extra weight.  I started wearing subtle trapeze style blouses and switched hoodies for button down blouses and I suddenly looked OK and far more appropriate.  I also got a haircut and payed more attention to how I combined different items of clothing with one another.\n\nHere are the things that I have learned step by step\n\n1. You don't have to give up your personal style.\n\nI like really girly things.  I like lettuce hems, sneakers with ribbon laces, oversized Peter pan collars, pointelle, ditzy florals, lace, crochet ect.\n\nHaving one statement piece per outfit is really the way to go.  I will wear my puma sneakers with the ribbon laces with a plain khaki blouse and some black leggings, or I'll wear a big pink velvet scrunchie or a frilly Peter pan collar and switch out the ribbon sneakers for a plain neutral colored pair.\n\nI'm also very casual and value comfort, I switched out hoodies for button down blouses.  I virtually stopped wearing hoods all together, on my coats and on my sweaters.  I think I still have one cardigan left with a hood, it's a long line crochet cardigan and it's bright violet in color.  I can pull it off if I completely tone down the rest of my outfit and if it's really cold outside.\n\nYou don't have to lose yourself, thanks to the internet women's clothing these days is incredibly diverse and even more mature pieces can give you a sense of your own individuality.\n\n2. If you are a mom, think about what you wouldn't want your mom to wear.\n\nYou wouldn't want your mom to pick you up from school wearing a crop top and go go boots, or to be showing a lot of cleavage or her midriff or lower back in low rise jeans.\n\nYou definitely don't want a mom that tries to look cool in front of your teenage friends.  We rightfully criticize men for this but we never openly give women this sort of advice.  You wouldn't want your dad doing the same.\n\nEven if you apparently have the body for it and you have kept yourself in great shape showing too much skin and dressing too young comes off as desperate.\n\nYou don't want to be that 'milf' or 'cougar' that shows everyone she still has it in a tight leather catsuit, even if you have a banging body that you have worked really hard for.   Men might enjoy looking at this but not the right kind and not in the right way.  \n\nA certain level of dignity, self assuredness and sophistication is expected from both women and men as they age and as they become parents for good reason.\n\n\n3. Pay attention to trends but don't follow every single one\n\nIt's important to stay current but not to let trends dominate your wardrobe.  It will definitely age you to dress in the exact same thing you wore a decade ago, things like hair, eyebrows, accessories and makeup apply as well.  You don't want to be hanging onto pencil thin eyebrows from 1999 or really thick, arched dramatic brows from a few years ago.  The best way is to either opt for groomed brows that follow your natural shape or to pay attention to current brow trends and adopt a subtle version of them.  The same goes with makeup and hairstyles.  You don't want to get exactly the same haircut every year.  A lot of women over a certain age make this mistake. You need to find out what works for you and allow it to evolve with what is current.\n\nA lot of us find our 'mom uniform'. We need to update that 'mom uniform' every now and then including our basics.  A longline blouse today isn't the same as a longline blouse 10 years ago, a basic black tee isn't the same as one in 2005.  Subtle details like the sleeves, buttons, collar, hem ect will have changed.  That doesn't mean you can't hang onto and wear some older items, but styling them in a way that looks intentional and current is key.  \n\nOn the other hand if you try and follow every trend you will just look silly.  If a 30 year old woman or mom is wearing white air force ones and a bucket hat with mom jeans and a crop top she's going to look ridiculous.  On the other hand if she just wears the air force ones and the mom jeans (no rips), ditches the crop top, wears a beige silk blouse and tucks it into her jeans and ditches the bucket hat she's going to look casual and sophisticated and also trendy.\n\n4. Single ladies, pay attention to what message your clothes send out to men.\n\nIf you are single and searching you need to be mindful about your wardrobe in terms of the men you want to attract.  If you are wearing very sexualized clothing you will attract seedy, sleazy men. If you dress in a juvenile way you will attract oddballs who want to imagine that they are dating a teenager and men who are stuck in their own youth.\n\nIf you dress age and situation appropriate you will attract appropriate men who want to be with a well adjusted adult woman.\n\n5. Don't dress like a typical grandma, even if you are a grandma\n\nIn reality, none of us want to be that older woman who has just given up.  She steps outside in Capri sweatpants and fake Crocs and some shapeless blouse with an ugly geometric print or even more embarrassing some t-shirt with Winnie the Pooh on the front.  She has the exact same hairstyle she had when she got married and had her first child many years ago.\n\nYou want to look intentional, you want to look like you are well groomed and you have at least put some thought into your outfit.  You don't want to look like you have just stopped caring.  \n\nOlder ladies often have more time and sometimes more money than younger ladies.  Now is the time to really enjoy your wardrobe, makeup and accessories.\n\nShoulder length hair is flattering on all age groups.  If you choose to dye your hair the safest option is to stick to some variation of your natural color.  Be careful about going for bright red or plum.  I see some older ladies do this and it usually looks awful.  Unless you used to be a rockstar, you probably won't be able to pull it off.  Be mindful of frizz as you age.  Younger women have to deal with frizz (I'm one of them), but it becomes an issue for larger numbers of older women. Don't be afraid to try new products and invest in heat styling tools to deal with frizz, lack of shine, lack of volume and unruly hair.\n\nA lot of older women who do at least try to look intentional also go over the top with gaudy, bright cheap looking accessories.  Don't fall into the trap of wearing bright blue plastic earrings and a red leopard print scarf and a green felt bubble necklace.  Be careful about jewelry.  You don't want jewelry to look cheap or gaudy.  Even if you are on a budget at least go for classic jewelry.  If you want to wear scarves look for creative ways to wear them, maybe on your handbag or tying them in a bow around your neck.  Be aware of prints and colors.  \n\nThere is just no reason to give up on yourself as you age.\n\n6. Have some way of checking your look\n\nInvest in a full length mirror and take photos of your outfits every now and then.  We get used to our own image in the mirror and don't always notice things.  Photographs offer an outside perspective of ourselves to ourselves.  It wasn't until I saw photographs that I saw how bad my too long hair and my outfits looked.\n\n\n7. Don't be juvenile or too sexy\n\nTeenage girls can get sort of get away with tight revealing clothing in some situations at least because they are still children in a lot of ways and still retain a lot of their innocence.  Only the creepiest of creeps are going to cat call or solicit a 13 year old girl (it still happens and you still need to protect your daughters, but that's a conversation for another time)  If you are an adult woman and you are stepping outside in anything you purchased from dollskill men everywhere will see it as an open invitation to have easy sex with you.  Not only that but the older and more out of shape you look the more desperate it looks and the more it looks like you are up for a random fling.  Think of the character Kim Day from Kath and Kim.  No one wants to look like that.  That character is a joke for good reason.\n\nTeenagers and young college girls also wear these sorts of clothes to impress and gain status within their peer group.  They don't wear them for mature people.  Only fully grown men with issues hit on college girls.  You don't want to attract these sorts of men by dressing and trying to look like you are still in college.\n\nOn the other side of the coin you don't want to infantilize yourself.  You don't want to dress like a young child.  Leave out the Disney characters unless you are actually taking a trip to Disneyland.  Be wary of things like hearts and wearing too much pink.\n\nForget tshirts with pugs or kittens on the front or any kind of cute animal or cutesy slogans like 'love' or 'good vibes'. Graphic tees in general are a risky outfit choice when you become an adult.  Maybe an adult woman with rock chick vibes could get away with a band tee, or you could wear the occasional graphic tee if it isn't too cutesy or juvenile.  However you don't want to make 'mom needs coffee' tees the main staple of your wardrobe and you want to add some sophistication into other aspects of your outfit.\n\nBeware of looking too girlish.  This was something I struggled with to some extent.  As I mentioned earlier, I love girlish things.  I still wear my puma basket hearts with ribbon laces, paperbag pants and big frilly Peter pan collars, however I tone the rest of my outfit down.  I would never think of pairing these items together or with something pink like I did in the past.  I have one girlish accent piece and the rest of my outfit is slightly edgy and\/or neutral.\n\nBe wary of logos.  If you are a middle aged woman wearing an oversized Nike t-shirt outside of the gym you will look frumpy.  Wearing visible socks with a swoosh on them you could get away with wearing some more casual outfits.  Logos should be subtle.  Don't rely on them to make the whole outfit like a young person seeking approval from their peers would.\n\nAnd please, please stay away from baseball caps and sports hoodies outside of the gym.  These clothing items are not for mature people.  You can do better, even if it's just a short trip to the grocery store.  No one past college age should ever be seen in a trucker hat in any situation, ever unless you are Finn Mckenty or a rockstar, they can pull it off.\n\n8. Don't let bodily insecurity get in the way of you paying attention to your outfits, instead find out what your body type is and wear flattering pieces.\n\nI'm a petite apple that carries some extra weight and has a very large bust.  I could complain all day about looking like humpty dumpty with a chest.  There are some who could tell me to grow some discipline get in perfect shape but in the meantime I don't want to look like I have made the conscious decision to stop caring about my appearance completely.  Regardless of your shape and size or level of conventional attractiveness you should try to dress well.  It shows that you care about yourself, at least enough to get out of bed and wear things that compliment you and to add your own personal touch to those things.  Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube are amazing for this.  Find and follow women whose style you like who have your body type.\n\nPlenty of women are so insecure about their bodies and the fact that they are aging or not beautiful that they completely sabotage themselves by trying hide themselves completely in dated, ugly, juvenile and unflattering clothing.\n\nYou have absolutely nothing to lose by trying to be a better version of yourself, even if it's just baby steps and you don't currently envision yourself going all the way.\n\n10.  Create a wardrobe that fits your needs\n\nIf you have bad feet or certain health issues, there is no point trying to wear heels.  My feet and ankles are so bad I can only wear flat comfort shoes or sneakers.  I have been this way as long as I can remember because of my joint hypermobility.  I can't wear extremely flat shoes with thin soles either.\n\nThere is no point buying anything that you find uncomfortable or that you will have to pull at and constantly adjust throughout the day.  \n\nIf you are a SAHM there is no reason to buy a professional work wardrobe.\n\nHowever you don't want to fall into the trap of wearing all athletic clothing. Plenty of stay at home moms do this and this is just another way of giving up.  \n\n11. Don't think that wearing expensive pieces will always make you look good and cheap\/affordable ones will always make you look bad\n\nYou might just find a blouse in Walmart or Primark that looks amazing, but that designer graphic tee you had to save up for looks tacky.\n\nFocus on how the clothing item is made, the fabric and the structure of it.  Clothing that pills will have looser fibers.  If you can easily pull out short fibers with your fingers and the item seems a little fuzzy the item will probably pill.  \n\nEven low end natural fabrics like linen and pure cotton can look polished. Modal, rayon and viscose can also be good options.\n\nSometimes loose threads in themselves are not problematic and can just be snipped off.  It doesn't necessarily mean the item itself is unravelling, sometimes factory workers don't trim off thread tails or parts of the sealed, raw hem are escaping from the seam, although the stitching is secure and the item is not falling apart.  If the item is unravelling, the stitching will come loose when you tug the thread.  I know some basic things about sewing and didn't know this until I started sewing.\n\nIf you have to buy cheap clothing because of your budget stay away from embellishments and polyester blends because of pilling.\n\nThink about how a clothing item will look after a few rounds in the laundry.  If you have the time you can hand wash your clothing.  I also recommend that you have clothing that you wear outdoors and clothing that you wear at home.\n\nWhen it comes to foot wear however, you should definitely spend at least $50 from a mid range brand. A pair of basic sneakers for $25 from a cheap fast fashion store will fall apart in a matter of weeks and you won't be able to put them in the washing machine, but a pair of Nike, Puma, UGG or Adidas for $50-150 will last longer without breaking and some can even be put in the washing machine.  I know that $50 doesn't sound like a lot to people, but when I was a poor teenager I used to go through shoes from Primark in a matter of weeks because I couldn't afford to drop enough for half decent shoes all at once  (I grew up in the UK) Some adults don't have a lot of money.  Comfortable shoes that last at least a year are something you should buy on credit or borrow money for if you really are that poor that you don't have enough all at once. Look after your feet. \n\n12.  Get a sewing machine and learn basic alterations\n\nEvery pair of pants look better on me when I shorten the hem.  I have trouble finding petite clothing where I currently live.  You don't need to be a seamstress to do some very basic alternations.\n\n\n\nIf anyone can think of anything else to add please feel free to comment.","title":"PSA on dressing for your age and place in life.

I think about having a baby alot. Obviously this does not mean that I want one rn but I have found that people nowadays are almost disgusted by the concept of a young woman bearing a child. My partner wants children by the time he is 30 or so - I will be 26 and fair enough i think that will give us time to lay down a foundation. Grow ourselves then to have growth in the relationship and to marry to raise the child in a stabilised environment to the best of which we could manage. \n\nI have been dreaming about little patterings of baby toes, curls and the smell of baby powder. I really look forward to motherhood. However, I find it sad to recieve a mostly negative reaction from mothers as well. \n\nI want children after marriage and that comes after I graduate from my degree. As me and my partner have agreed but until then a girl can day dream. I just think maybe our bodies and hormones may be suggesting that you're ready when you see a baby and your first reaction is to smile then crave its little touch. It's one of those things - as a traditional woman in the modern world I feel as though I must negotiate with the social pressure and ignore my biological wiring. \n\nThank you feminism. It is now low brow to be married and have a child at a young age. It is considered the less educated and less productive alternative- or for many women as I it is not even an alternative. There has been a removal of choice. \n\nNo one woman wants to welcome a child into the world whilst having her family and friends judge the choice as a waste of potential. And now men are less inclined to actively desire fatherhood and marriage because of the death of feminity in the culture and the collapse of respect in society for masculine responsibility bearing men. \n\nI truly feel a loss and maybe many women will. Whilst I am holding off and fulfilling the status quo like a coward (as an agreement to my family members who wish for me to have independence rather than a family - a career which for me is more of a backup than a goal) I am losing eggs. My fear is imagine if holding off means difficulty in conceiving later on in life... I would of shot my own dreams in the head. Sorry ladies for the dramatisation but I feel truly alone in this. I have discussed this with my partner but he empathises with the situation. However, I feel as a man he does not understand. And women before would be each others crutches in the realm of womanhood and it is lonely. It is very lonely. I have no mother. I have feminist friends and family members. It is lonely and scary to not express these repressed anxieties. Thank you.","title":"Baby fever...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ijarmg\/baby_fever\/"}

All it said was \"My refrigerator went out again, can you come by and fix it?\"\n\nI gave him his phone back and showed him the text, which he snatched it back from my hand. I started putting 2 and 2 together, i remembered he's been a little more distant lately. Like last week, i waited up all night for him to come pick me up for a date at the movies, but he never showed up. He told me he tried to call 10 times, but my phone never rang.\n\nThat night, i invited him over. I asked him about his strange behavior, he said he'd been interviewing for a new job and meeting up with his new boss and was trying to keep it a secret so he could surprise me in case it didn't work.\n\nI wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt so i just dropped it, but then he just blurted out \"I can't do this anymore.\" I asked what he meant, he said he'd been lying. That, yes, he was cheating. I had a feeling he had and now he just confessed. I asked who it was with, because i was genuinely curious. I assumed it was this girl from his work, i swore i've seen her checking him out. I asked him if it was her, he denied it. He said it was Mrs. Ortega. (She's this woman who lives in his apartment complex, like on the same hallway. She's in her 40's, my bf said she's divorced and lives alone.)\n\nI remember clearly, the first thing out of my mouth was \"What?! She's 43! What the hell is wrong with you?\" He spilled his guts and told the whole story. That she asked for help getting her new furniture, and just started rubbing flirting with him. That he just lost control and before he knew it, he was in bed with her. He said he's been going over there every day almost for 3 weeks. He started going into detail about how she seduced him and everything, but i told him to shut up.\n\nHe said he wasn't felling fulfilled with me anymore. That she gets him. And then he left.\n\nI just wanna know why? Why would he do this?

We've always had sex, but whereas I was happy with a couple of times a week, he would rather it most days.\n\nI don't wish to go into any details - but a few things from my childhood gave me some hang-ups about sex, and I never felt completely relaxed. I always thought that overcoming these issues would be some big revelation...but nope. We have recently had our second child, and I just really missed my husband in all of the craziness. I missed us so much, and just wanted to be with him.\n\nSuddenly, I have no hang-ups about sex, and it's been completely amazing.

I am a 31 year old woman who has had some pretty significant issues with dating the last few years. For most of my 20s, I was in a 7 year old long relationship with the same guy who was wonderful in most ways, but we had entirely different perspectives on finances. We argued a lot during our relationship and likely developed an unhealthy codependency. Having met him in my 20s, the only thing I knew about life 4 years ago was him and my career path. I had lost of my sense of self and had such a poor understanding of what it meant to be a complete person.\n\nSo when I started dating again, I had no idea who I was. Somehow, in my mind, I had developed this idea that being that cool sexy party chick was the ideal. I don't even know why. I think I was always the \"cool girl\" to hang out with in college and so I could easily get the attention of most of the guys I was interested in so I assumed a similar approach would work at this stage in my life as well. My taste in guys was also likely questionable back then...\n\nAnyways, after leaving my ex, I reverted back to selling myself the way I did in college, and was confused when I seemed to only attract players or really socially awkward men who were very uncomfortable with themselves. I didn't get it. I thought, \"Why doesn't anyone of value like me? I have a good job, I went to an Ivy League school, I make lots of money, I'm nice, I have varied interests.\" In retrospect, I didn't have any interests, I was merely trying to be what I thought people wanted and everyone else could probably tell.\n\nSince I was really lonely and wanted some companionship, I spent a lot of time obsessing over my failures in dating. My friends seemed to be meeting men fine so I knew there was something that I was doing incorrectly. I kept digging myself deeper and deeper into the hole that I was in, thinking that if I would succeed if I tried even harder to be the laidback fun party girl and completely neglected developing my own personal interests. There was also a part of me that thought I shouldn't have to put much effort into dating since I am objectively physically attractive (only saying this because I have been told that I am). So I put minimal effort into my pictures and profile. I described my career in great detail and my interests consisted of \"music, drinks, hanging out with friends.\"\n\nAfter a series of failed attempts and perusing this board, I decided to take some time off and work on myself. However, my initial attempts to \"work on myself\" still consisted of trying to squeeze myself into this box of what I thought guys wanted, so I greatly overcompensated and tried to turn myself into this demure, innocent, child-like girl who was only interested in home-making, cooking, and fixing whatever other problem I thought I had that had transferred over from the last guy that I dated. The whole thing felt awkward to me and of course it did not get me anywhere either.\n\nFinally, starting this year, I told myself that I would really focus on who I am, listen to my heart, and follow my interests. I picked up a number of hobbies that had nothing to do with trying to attract a man. After 9 years off, I started snowboarding again and developed the courage to go on snowboarding trips by myself even if my friends weren't interested. I decided that I would live life for myself and just be happy. If my friends wanted to come along, great. If not, that's fine too, I wouldn't have to wait around for them on the mountain and could board at my own pace. I stopped trying to be that cool chick, stopped trying to be Suzy homemaker, and just did what really spoke to my soul.\n\nAnd I finally revamped my online dating profile and actually put some effort into it. I took out the references to live music and drinking (because I honestly didn't do it anymore) and added in what I actually truly enjoy: nature, art and photography, food. For the last year, I had been wanting to get a group of people together to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and I realized that I should add this fact into my profile. I don't know why I never thought of it! I was so stuck on trying to be a certain type of person that I didn't realize I was suppressing so much of my true personality. I think I feared being honest out of low self-esteem. I was afraid that I would have to live up to my promises if I revealed my true interests and for some reason I didn't think I was capable of that.\n\nAfter making these tweaks to my profile, I immediately started seeing a different response from the guys online. The ones who I was interested in, who always seemed to ignore me before, suddenly were liking me back and wanting to chat and learn more about me. I had honestly never seen such a positive response before. And I think what was so reassuring about all of this was getting good feedback for finally pursuing life on my terms.\n\nI've learned that whatever sort of weird preconceptions I had about men before were totally incorrect. Sure, guys are very visual and enjoy sex, but they aren't these mindless beasts who just want to hang out with a pretty face who will drink with them and make their beds. In fact, the good ones are probably turned off by that. They probably can sense the desperation and the attempts to be something that you are not. But if you have a vibrant life, a good attitude, a good work ethic, and you don't spend every waking moment of your life trying to build yourself into what you think other people want, people can sense that too. And the start to all of that is to really know who you are and to be that.\n\nI know I have so much farther to go since I am just starting to figure this out. I have to learn how to take this knowledge and apply it to how I interact with people in my day to day life as well. In all honesty, it's probably still too early for me to start dating. But I am very hopeful, excited, and happy that I seem to have finally started to solve some of the problems in my life after many, many attempts.\n\nI'm grateful for this sub as I wouldn't have spent nearly as much time really digging deep and trying to figure out what I've been doing wrong all of these years without studying the teachings here. I think I took it a little too literally in the beginning and focused way too much on trying to pursue what I had imagined to be the image of the \"ideal\" woman. But really, I think what this sub advocates for is growth in your personal life (develop your personal interests and work on your appearance), physical health (stay fit and active), and your mental health (stay open-minded, kind, nurturing). And to be honest to yourself and admit that dominant men can be very attractive and how to allow that dynamic to develop between you and him.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share my latest learnings with this community. Dating definitely will be more difficult for me as an older woman than it was in my 20s, but I have a feeling the quality will improve greatly. :)","title":"Field report in online dating: you are who you attract","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/834fyw\/field_report_in_online_dating_you_are_who_you\/"}

I\u2019m a SAHM and we have 2 babies under 2. I do 100% of the cooking and cleaning. He spoils me financially and in our lives, always picking up projects to make me happy and make my dreams come true. He\u2019s extremely affectionate and compliments me often, loves to cuddle and spend time together.\n\nFrom the time I got pregnant with my first, sex has been an issue. I just never felt desired and would be frequently turned down. He\u2019s loving and treats me like his queen in most ways, except in the bedroom. I could walk into the room naked and he wouldn\u2019t even glance up. He doesn\u2019t try to remove my clothes during sex and has almost never touched my breasts\/genitals\/butt etc in a way indicating that he\u2019s attracted to me. I\u2019ve surprised him with his favorite fantasy roleplay costumes, I\u2019ve offered him head EVERY morning, I\u2019ve done romantic bubble bath massage things and he just goes to sleep, I\u2019ve tried texting nudes.. If you name it I\u2019ve tried it. Basically the only times he\u2019s been excited about sex has been trying to conceive.\n\nI swallowed this because he always said it was stress, work, aging, tired, busy, depressed, something different every time. I thought maybe it was age and didn\u2019t want to be the younger partner blaming him.\n\nThen I found the porn.\n\nAnd I scrolled back and it all made sense.\n\nAlmost every day going back months and years he\u2019s been watching porn and I had no idea. Watching while I slept, while I took care of the babies, while he was supposedly working in his home office. Watching extremely skinny and perfect girls. Watching girls who look younger than me and like they\u2019ve never had babies. I was fucking crushed and we fought for months.\n\nI read a ton about porn addiction and sent him all the studies. I begged him to cool it. I told him I would be available and enthusiastic any time possible, I would focus all my efforts on weight loss and fitness, get whatever hairstyle or a tummy tuck or boob job or whatever it is he needs to want me instead but it WILL NOT WORK if he\u2019s desensitizing his brain with infinite novelty every day. I told him I will do my part but he has to do his.\n\nWe had a few false starts where he talked about stopping but didn\u2019t explicitly promise and I\u2019d find he never stopped, and he\u2019d weasel out of it - say he didn\u2019t realize I wanted him to, or he just forgot and clicked on it out of habit without realizing it or didn\u2019t think it counted if he was just using it to get to sleep while he was on a business trip and I wasn\u2019t there anyway, or he just watched it to get ideas of things to try with me and wasn\u2019t getting turned on by it, etc. So I finally cornered him and got it explicitly in writing - no porn for 1 month, whatsoever, while we work on our sex life. He promised, in writing.\n\nI checked today and looks like he made it 7 days before caving. I didn\u2019t tell him I knew, just asked how the no porn was going and he said great.

I\u2019ve tried SHOWERING him in affection, pampering him, being super fun and getting us out doing things, offering as much new and exciting sex as I can fit into our day utilizing babysitters and sleep training and screen time, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working.\n\nFor instance, when he told me he was into the anime cosplay look I surprised him dressed up that way and even watched the specific videos he had watched even though it was painful so I could try to do the expressions\/sounds etc he likes - literally with a 1 year old and 2 month old I made time to shave, moisturize, self tan, dress up, do makeup and hair, get everyone to nap at the same time \u2014 what ended up happening was that he didn\u2019t finish, and hours later was on the ipad watching anime cosplay porn. Like wtf.\n\nFollowing his lead here scares me so badly but taking charge doesn\u2019t seem to be working either.\n\nI vetted him well and read Fascinating Womanhood and Surrendered Wife and Empowered Wife all early and I just don\u2019t know where to go from here.","title":"What would the \u201cSurrendered Wife\u201d approach be to husband\u2019s excessive porn use?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/15i3lyp\/what_would_the_surrendered_wife_approach_be_to\/"}

So I Started One\n\nAs founder and editor-in-chief of a new web site aimed at women, I often get asked: Why do we need yet another publication in this already crowded media niche? It\u2019s simple: Until now, all of the major players have had one common characteristic. Can you guess what it is?\n\nWhen Bryan Goldberg announced in a blog post that he had raised $6.5 million to start Bustle.com, a site for women, many competitors weren\u2019t happy. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time for a women\u2019s publication that puts world news and politics alongside beauty tips?\u201d Goldberg wrote. A Jezebel writer, Hazel Cills, responded that such sites already exist. And she was right\u2014perhaps more so than Cills knew: All the publications mentioned in her Jezebel article\u2014The Hairpin, The Toast, Bust, Bitch, xoJane, Autostraddle, Refinery29, AfterEllen and Jezebel itself\u2014push a liberal, feminist message. The same is true of older outlets such as *Cosmopolitan*, *Elle*, *Glamour* and *Allure.* Go ahead and find me a single successful, mainstream women\u2019s lifestyle-and-culture publication that doesn\u2019t regularly exhibit a bias against conservative points of view.\n\nThere\u2019s been a shift in recent years in the kind of content these publications push. Do most women you know really want to grow hairy legs? No. Do they really want to forgo feminine hygiene, because \u201ca real man loves his woman any time of the month\u201d? No. Do they like cheering for male-bodied individuals who dominate women\u2019s sports\u2014like when Fallon Fox crushed a woman\u2019s skull in MMA? Definitely not.\n\nFor decades, magazines have sold women countless lies about sex, emotional fulfillment and health issues\u2014usually under the guise of \u201cempowerment.\u201d They prey on women\u2019s insecurities by normalizing unhealthy extremes (first it was borderline anorexia, now it\u2019s obesity). They encourage casual sex and lie to readers about its emotional ramifications. They tell women they\u2019ll be unhappy with a husband and kids but fulfilled working for a male boss at a big corporation. They laud celebrities who aren\u2019t good role models, turned Hillary Clinton into an object of worship, and attack or ignore women who don\u2019t share their views.\n\n... read full article: [https:\/\/quillette.com\/2019\/02\/20\/women-needed-a-magazine-that-doesnt-lie-to-them-so-i-started-one\/](https:\/\/quillette.com\/2019\/02\/20\/women-needed-a-magazine-that-doesnt-lie-to-them-so-i-started-one\/)","title":"Women Needed a Magazine that Doesn\u2019t Lie to Them.

He does all of his \u201cindividual\u201d chores by himself, and he wants to split major ones like cleaning the kitchen, bathroom, and vacuuming the apartment. \n\nIn fact, he gets a little irritated when I offer to clean his dishes as a gesture. \n\nI always thought that when we moved in together I\u2019d be able to use all the tactics I learned here and make him a happy man, but he says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to marry a maid\u201d and doesn\u2019t need me to worry about it. \n\nThe thing is, he also doesn\u2019t want me to pay for anything house related.

We lived apart, after being together for almost two years we had managed to maintain that hot-honeymoon phase. To me, we were building a foundation and I just didn't see a need to rush into the rest of our lives. I wanted to be child free for a while and just enjoy him.\n\nHe wanted to get married and have kids. He wanted me to not work and be a stay at home mom which I agree with. If I have kids, I absolutely need to home school them and be with them and I told him such. For me, motherhood is REALLY big deal and right now, I am not ready.\n\nI just wanted to travel and set my life up in such a way that I can leave the country for weeks at a time, possibly for work, but have a home base. That was my focus, establishing a way to support him in his career and be a wife and mom that was local while also giving my family the opportunity to stay anywhere for whatever amount of time.\n\nWe ended up dissolving. He was seeing someone else within a couple of months. They moved in together 3 months after we broke up, she got pregnant and they got married a couple weeks following all within a year of us breaking up. Needless to say I was shocked and also not shocked. Definitely painful.\n\nBefore I met him, I had never felt easy about placing my bets on some mystery man. To me so much would ride on a stranger I might never meet so I just focused on building what was in front of me and hoping that lead \"the one\" to cross my path. With him, I had a lot of reasons he wasn't it. I had just broken up with a guy I had known for 15 years, he was just supposed to be a fun bandaid. I didn't take him seriously because I knew we were just FWB from the beginning and wasn't expecting him to fall in love with me and insist that we become a couple which is what happened. That pesky timing thing, ya know?\n\nI have a bad habit of only wanting what I can't have. When he was offering me all of this, I couldn't guarantee that's what I'd want. I was unsure of his loyalty and maybe I brought it on by retreating but also considering how fast he went with his now wife, maybe I was right to be reticent.\n\nI just don't know where am I suppose. The last two years I have totally taken myself out of any kind of romance. I've basically been in monk mode, going to work, taking classes, and reflecting on what I actually want with my life. I found red pill-ish material around the time our break up started (it lasted a couple weeks). Part of me wished I would've came across the other side of feminist philosophy before we had started dating because I feel like I fucked up but on the other hand, his influence is what prompted me to have this epiphany.\n\nSo now I'm 33 and I read the hardcore red pill stuff and I'm like. \"omg, I've become this loser old lady fuck what have I done?\" But yet, I stayed true to how I was raised. My mother always told me to not get married til after 30. She's still with my dad so I listened to her. My aunt told me \"never settle\" after being miserably married to her wealthy abusive husband. Anytime anyone ended up accidentally pregnant I just cringed and felt so proud that I had control of my reproductive system. Now I'm wondering if I just had faulty programming in my 20s and is it too late? When I look back at previous relationships, he was the only one that was viable as husband material but I'm skeptical I'm putting rose-colored nostalgia over that relationship at this point.\n\nConstructive criticism welcome. This matters to me now because for the first time in my life, I want to date with the intention of LTR and it's a weird place for me. I take care of myself, physically, financially, emotionally. I have ogod relationships, I'm healthy, I have hobbies. To me, I feel like I'm a matured me with experience and developed tastes and ideas. I feel like this is the best time to meet someone and settle down but traditional red pill stuff makes me feel like I'm a wrinkly old spinster who pissed away her shot at a family for being autonomous and not wanting to settle on good enough.\n\nTruth is, I've never met anyone that I was head over heels in love with and I don't know if I need to lower my standards and surrender to settling or I'm just not cut out for having the love I've conceived of in my head.","title":"33 year old former feminist.

I\u2019m 39 and husband is 42. I feel like I\u2019m falling in love with him all over again lately. He\u2019s so good looking and I\u2019m not just saying that because he\u2019s my husband. He\u2019s getting more handsome with age. And he\u2019s so much happier after quitting one of his jobs. He\u2019s been a better father and husband and does things for us he never had energy or time for before. It\u2019s amazing. \n\nAt first, I was worried a little bit because we\u2019ve never had a lot of time together during our marriage. I\u2019ve heard that during Covid, a lot of people split up when they realized they don\u2019t really have much in common after having to spend a lot of time together. \n\nAs a child of divorced parents, I guess I\u2019ve worried about things like that in the back of my mind.\nSo lately, I\u2019ve been listening to the Empowered Wife podcast, Alison Armstrong, and Margarita Nazarenko. I\u2019ve been trying to let go of control and let him come to me instead of acting clingy.\n\n\nThe last few days I\u2019ve been trying to give the black cat energy. Just kind of staying in my own space. Kind of more interested in my own thing and unbothered. Maybe I don\u2019t know exactly how to do it because he asked me what\u2019s wrong lol. \nI asked what he meant and he said I wasn\u2019t as affectionate as usual. He told me that he wants me to kiss him and be all over him and act really affectionate and to hold him.  I told him he didn\u2019t seem like he wanted that because he wasn\u2019t doing those things to me and he denied it and said that he wants me to be that way and how much he likes it. I gave him a long kiss when he got home later and he said \u201cthere\u2019s my wife.\u201d\n\nAlso, after our first date 20 years ago, I called him first. No other girl had done that with him and we\u2019ve been together ever since.\n\nSo it\u2019s got me thinking and I wanted to share that sometimes, they want to be chased a little bit. They want to know how much you like them. So don\u2019t wait for him to come to you all of the time. \nShow him how much you like him and see what happens.

I wanted to set my own schedule and be my own \"girl-boss\". I worked as crazy hours as my boyfriend who is also self-employed for over 6 years. He told me he supports me and would be with me through this part of my life.\n\nWell, after 2 years of my go-getter lifestlye my boyfriend asked me if I was happy because he could tell I wasn't. I confessed I'm happiest when I'm taking care of the home, baking or cooking, making our space a nice place to live and reading a good book at the end of the day.\n\nI was scared that he wanted someone who could match his energy. Scared of how our relationship would change when I admited this. To my surprise, he just wanted me to be happy. He said he loves when I have food for him when he gets home and me making our space homey makes him want to rush home back to me.\n\nWe decided I'd get a regular job for now while he's building his business to get us our own place and start our life (engagement\/marriage) which just wasn't possible when we were both \"getting it out the mud\".\n\nA couple months later, and he told me in a moment of tenderness that he just wants to take care of me. In the months while I was finding a job (the market is insane for my industry) he refused to let me buy anything ever. He'd even get \"upset\" when I'd bring out cash and say \"I'm taking care of you. Stop it.\"\n\nI feel so blessed. I now am employed, but we have such a different dynamic than before. I feel like a princess in every day life. He takes such good care of me, and I him of course. The laundry is done. There is always food or treats. And I don't worry about a single bill or payment. Obviously, things will change again when I have a job, but he confessed to me last night he loves my submission. He finds it sexy and he loves when our roles are cemented in this way. He said he loves that he knows I am confident and can take charge but I trust him to do it and look at him with adoration.\n\nAll this to say, create the life you want with your person now. Establish the dynamic now.

For men who have a degree it can be 26, for men who graduated from high school it can be 23\/24, for men who go to graduate school it will be a few years after they are done with education. The window of marriage is open for 4-6 years and after this the chances a man will marry drop every year after.\n\n\n\u2022A majority of college graduates 28-33 are in their high commitment phase \n\n\n\u2022After 38, the chances a man who has never married will ever marry drop dramatically. Around 42-43 many men are confirmed bachelors \n\n\n\u2022Men want a few years to sow their wild oats after finishing education. For a few years after graduation they are in low commitment phase\n\n\n\u2022Men enter the high commitment phase when they\u2019re tired of the singles scene.  The singles scene had lost some of its appeal and they were looking for the next step. A lot of men get tired of the singles scene and sometimes feel uncomfortable because the new attendees were much younger, and they were outgrowing the places they had frequented the last 5 years. \n\n\n\u2022However professional men still feel comfortable in the singles scene for a little while longer. \n\n\n\u2022Men who were balding or heavy wanted to get out of the singles scene much earlier. Women in the singles scene treat older-looking men in the scene as if they don\u2019t belong, which drives the balding and heavy men away. \n\n\n\u2022*It is not how old they are that makes men uncomfortable, it is how old they feel, or how old others make them feel.*\n\n\n\u2022If a woman wants to know how ready a man is to marry, she should ask how much he enjoys the singles scene\n\n\u2022Men who have been married before are substantially more like to marry again than a man who has never married in his middle age\n\n\n\u2022If a woman in her 40s has never been married the most eligible bachelors are divorcees and widowers\n\n\n\u2022If you\u2019re dating a man who has had one more long term relationships but didn\u2019t marry them, he may be a stringer. He enjoys the benefits a committed woman brings but is not the marrying kind \n\n\n\u2022The \u201cpractise wife\u201d - a man dates one woman for a long period of time, then after breaking up immediately marries another woman after a short period (controversial idea on here I know). The second woman insisted they commit early into the relationship. When you date a man, make your timeline clear. \n\n\n\u2022*We ran across at least fifty men we could identify as stringers. They can be very dangerous. I estimate each one is responsible for at least two women remaining single. They are destructive because they con women into wasting their time during the years when they are most attractive and most likely to get a proposal.*\n\n\u2022Men feel their biological clocks too\n\n\n\u2022They worry not about fathering a child, but being a father to a child. They want to be young and physically fit enough to bond with their son through sports and exercise, like teaching them how to fish, ride a bike, play ball etc. \n\n\n\u2022Men over 40 who are eager to have a son are more likely to marry \n\n\n\u2022Men in their late 30s\/early 40s who had given up on the idea of marriage usually lacked either looks, height or social skills. They had been rejected so often they didn\u2019t think they could find a woman who loved them \n\n\n\u2022A lot of these men said \u201cif I could find a nice woman I\u2019d marry her tomorrow\u201d. So excessively shy, late 30s men could be good options\n\n\n\u2022However some men over 40 see a wife as a bad financial investment. They\u2019ve built a nest egg, women only want what they can get out of a man etc. However the men who spoke this way often weren\u2019t very successful themselves. These men are not the marrying kind\n\n\n\u2022If their parents divorced when they were young, men often say they don\u2019t believe in marriage, romance ends once married\n\n\n\u2022Older men with parents who had a good marriage often say they are not ready to be married or they\u2019re not the marrying type \n\n\n\u2022Men who live with their parents are less likely to marry than men who live by themselves\n\n\n\u2022Men who have never lived away from home are also less likely to marry than men who have lived at college or worked in a different city \n\n\n\u2022Men are more likely to marry if their friends have married in the last year. \n\n\n\u2022*More than 60 percent of the men we questioned coming out of marriage license bureaus told us they had a friend who had married within the last year.\n\n\nthis was supposed to be a summary but I basically rewrote the whole article, sorry! I guess it saves you clicking a link \n\n\nany single ladies have any thoughts comments concerns? will this article change your strategy? I personally was surprised to see that men with degrees start thinking about marriage at 26, thats earlier than I would\u2019ve thought (although the article is 8 years old). i usually have my age range on dating apps as 28-35 as a 25F but I think I\u2019ll try 27-33 next time I try the apps. I did initially think the older the better but generally I find 34\/35yo men pretty overbearing and we don\u2019t get on that well personality wise.  There\u2019s lots of women my age who are attractive and also looking for marriage from 27-33yo men so RMV has to be very high. I\u2019m also going to ask men how much they enjoy going out with the guys still, if they have a favourite spot etc. How else would you action some of the points listed?\n\nI\u2019m not at all surprised men who have married before are more likely to do so again, my dad is on his third marriage. The follow the pack point rings true for me too; two of my brother\u2019s (29) friends have been engaged in this past year and my brother is starting to plan a proposal. \n\n\nmarried women do any of these reflect your husband\u2019s circumstances at the time? \n\n\n","title":"When men marry ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1gdhrk0\/when_men_marry\/"}

If I lean down, lean down with me, don't struggle to remain upright. Relax and hold on to me \u2026. If you keep tensing up, pulling against me, trying to go the opposite direction, it makes it even more difficult. I can't drive if you don't trust me.\n\nAll this is to say: you move with him.  At my job we tell people to \u201crow the boat in the same direction\u201d. It is the same thing. On RPW we simply suggest that you allow your trusted partner to set the course. Then you both row in the same direction. When he leans right, you lean with him. If he leans right and you stop to argue then you fall off the bike. \n\nThis tells him that you trust his judgment which he will interpret as love and respect.  \n\nDo you follow him into a burning building if he asks? This is where most women puff up their chests and say \u201cI would never risk myself just because a man asks me to\u201d. My food for thought question is: how much to do you trust him? This is a hypothetical but I can imagine hypotheticals where yes, you do trust him enough with your well-being to follow him. A good man wants to [be the protector of his wife and family](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/atrbg5\/book_club_fascinating_womanhood_chapter_9_the\/). He will not ask you to do something where the risk outweighs the reward. *(We are not going to discuss here the type of men who do not cherish you enough to deserve your trust. It is obvious that there are bad partners. This is why we vet.)*\n\n####There is no one, compares with you\n\nIn more specific terms, how can you show submission? If you aren\u2019t a bdsm sub with strict rules and a diet of bondage and spanking, then what does this look like? Ask yourself what you can do to demonstrate that he is the head of the household and you respect him as your partner and husband. \n\n* This can be small acts of service, like feeding him first or thinking to bring him a glass of lemonade while he\u2019s mowing the lawn.  These things show your appreciation and your service acknowledges his role as the head of the house.\n\n* It can be praising him in front of others as well as never arguing with him in front of others. You are a team and you are rowing in the same direction.  [STFU is a sign of respect & trust.]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pwrd5m\/back_to_basics_september_stfu\/)   \n\n* Arguing isn\u2019t fun for anyone and is usually avoidable.  You can always ask him for clarification in a more appropriate situation. \n\n* It means [bringing him your problems]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4i8ukh\/bring_your_captain_your_problem_not_your_solution\/). You don\u2019t do this because you are incapable of solving it yourself. You do it because men like a challenge and are happy to help fix a problem and be your hero. \n\n* It can be telling him your desires and trusting him to build those into the life plan. \n\n* It can be fixing your make up before he gets home each night.\n\n* It can be asking him sweetly to order for you at a restaurant. \n\n*Submission as a means of showing respect is a way to hack the male brain.*  When we know men crave respect and affirmation, know they are worried that they do not measure up, know they need to protect and provide, then we can let those things guide our interactions.  \n\nThis may all seem stupidly easy and obvious but you must remember what a standard relationship looks like in 2022. A glance at posts filled with \u201cthat\u2019s a red flag\u201d and \u201cI would never trust a man enough to\u2026\u201d tell us that even on RPW there is little trust and respect for men.  Letting these concepts guide your interactions with your man will set you apart from all the lukewarm relationships out there.  This as I see it, is the minimum threshold for \u201cwhat is submission\u201d and anyone can do it whether they are naturally submissive or just want to love their man in his language.\n\n---\n[Bonus content: a post full of example posts]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pu9brj\/submission_field_report_examples\/) thanks u\/LivelyLychee\n\n---\nSpecial thanks to Kaos and Mae-Hem for their contributions in writing this post.

I'm 39 and married with a little boy (3). I became gradually disillusioned with feminism after giving birth to my boy and realizing that all the feminist ideals that were fed to me for decades left me ill-prepared to handle maternity. I hated the way that so many people around me, including close female friends, expected me to keep prioritizing my job and couldn't understand why I couldn't go out as much as I did before because my son and my husband came first. This led me to feel isolated and very depressed. During this time, I entered a cycle of overeating and neglecting my appearance, which made me feel even worse.\n\nI'm seeing a therapist now and I'm getting better. But I'm still looking for ways to improve myself, to look better and to feel more feminine. My parents gave me strong values, but my mother never really taught me how to present myself as a feminine woman and be attractive. It's only now that I see how important these things are and how feminism has filled my head with \"screw what any man thinks, do whatever you want and dress however you want, be a boss b\\*\\*\\*\\* with a loud mouth\", etc. No thank you. \n\nThis is especially important to me as I feel my husband, who is a wonderful man and father to our son, really held my head out of the water when I was depressed. He deserves to come home from work to a wife who makes his day better with a positive attitude and a polished appearance. But it's still a struggle for me and I don't know anyone around me who can help. \n\nHave any moms among you struggled with the same issues?

I also explain what is what you actually deserve, the types of the thing you deserve and the difference between what you want and what you deserve, how to get what you want without anyone having to owe it to you, and how to deserve what you already have. \n\n**Brainwashing**\n\nGrowing in the 2010s with 3rd wave feminism being a gospel and female \u201cempowerment\u201d the subplot of all lectures at school, I\u2019ve witnessed how this phrase has stuck to the brains of women all over the western world even so that I hear it in redpilled and antifeminist spaces, it is sickening to observe the extent of the popularization of the mindset behind it, and before getting into the actual breakdown of it, I took the time to compile some of the most important points of the mentioned mindset:\n\n\\- \"I\u2019ll take as much time as I need to find my perfect man\u201d: women whose motto is this, believe that there\u2019s always time for them to meet people and they will be worth as much or even more as before so why rushing through life? We all are going to live forever.\n\n\\- \"I\u2019m worth whatever I say I am\u201d: their worth as potential partners is based on the mental idea they have of themselves and no one can say otherwise.\n\n\\-\"What I want is what I deserve and I want a perfect person\u201d: if their partners want perfection they have to be perfect. Period. \n\n\\-\"You don\u2019t think the same? Why do you hate yourself so much?\u201d: they think that objective opinions of oneself are clear signs of low self-esteem. \n\nAt this point you probably know where we are going...but let\u2019s get right into the analysis.\n\n**What is what** ***you*** **deserve?** \n\nThe meaning of \u201cdeserve\u201d has been modified throughout the years, but here\u2019s the real definition:\n\n*\u201cto have earned or to be given something because of the way you have behaved or the qualities you have\u201d*\n\nThis means that what you deserve are the good or bad things that you have to receive according to what you\u2019ve done or what you are. For a better understanding of what you deserve, I\u2019ll classify them into 3.\n\n\\-*The things that you deserve inherently:* these are all the things that you deserve simply because you exist, these are:\n\n* Human rights: for example, you deserve a life free of torture, so if your partner physically punishes you, you don\u2019t deserve it and you have to protect yourself or ask for protection. \n* The laws of your country and state (or province): all the rules and laws that protect all citizens, for example, if your country grants you a lawyer because you\u2019re going through a criminal trial, you deserve that lawyer.\n\n\\-*The things that you deserve as consequence:* these are all the punishments, compensations, and prizes you must receive because of what you\u2019ve done or what you haven\u2019t, but, very important, you can\u2019t annulate the things that a person inherently deserves to punish him\/her. Examples of things you deserve as a consequence of your actions can be: if you got divorced, you deserve paying or receiving a pension or child support; If you steal things, you deserve going to jail; if you work you deserve your paycheck. \n\n\\-*The things that you deserve as an agreement:*  everything that you must receive because there was a previous agreement. People can\u2019t read minds, if you spent 5 years with a guy and he decides to break up and you put your whole life in stand by for him to marry you at some point, he doesn\u2019t owe you that, if you just hoped but never said anything, you don\u2019t deserve that he stays with you. Or if you agree with your husband that you will live together forever but he decides to leave you, there\u2019s no law that can protect you from that but you deserved him to stay based on a previous agreement. \n\n**Achieving what you want over what you deserve**\n\nSo you\u2019re probably thinking \u201coh then I don\u2019t t deserve a guy that I like with all the characteristics that my ideal men have?\u201d Well, no, but you surely can get what you *want.* \n\nAnd getting what you want comes from what you can do to get it, we all are here to discuss the red pill dating strategy, the different ways you can get that special person to spend life with. \n\nWanting a kind, loving, and caring man isn\u2019t something bad or unreachable, but wanting something means that you have to move, risk and make some effort to achieve it.\n\n**Having good self-esteem is believing that you can get what you want without anyone having to owe it to you**  \n\nWe are often told that if we don\u2019t think we can wait for the perfect man to fall from the sky and beg on his knees for us, we have low self-esteem, but that statement is merely narcissistic. Narcissism hides lots of insecurities, it is painful and arrogant, and they will never admit they feel lonely or sad. When you have good and healthy self-esteem, not a low one, that makes you think that taking away your rights or respect is what you deserve or a high one; is trusting in your strategy, believing in yourself, having the confidence to make agreements with your partner, to communicate with the person you love, to take care of your body, to respect the person you spend your life with and not to ask him to buy you everything you want with a sad entitled attitude. \n\nHaving healthy self-esteem is looking after the well-being of your loved one without thinking that that is degrading you somehow, is knowing that the other person deserves things and actions too and you have to respect them. Giving another person, especially the person you like or love, the same treatment you want to receive, isn\u2019t humiliating yourself, it is humility and the basic polite thing a person can do. \n\n**Deserving what you want and wanting what you deserve** \n\nAnd of course, wanting something and actually planning to reach it has its details. Your plan has to have 3 characteristics, it has to be reasonable, realistic, and coherent in time, place, and resources. If you\u2019re planning on getting the perfect man or the perfect life with your current partner, it is very important that you analyze and objectively identify your qualities, flaws, and the moment of your life you\u2019re living in right now. \n\nFor example, it is less likely for you to get a man if you have children or if you\u2019re above 30, and you have to plan accordingly, the dating pool is quite something. If you want to have fun for a moment and ponder a little about your standards I recommend you taking the [Female delusion test](https:\/\/igotstandardsbro.com\/) if there\u2019s just a tiny probability of you getting the man of your dreams you should probably lower your standards, and remember that the perfect men aren\u2019t the richest or the tallest, there are tons of characteristics that a person can have and that can complement yours. \n\nIf you already have a wonderful man by your side, make yourself worthy of deserving him and what he gives you, invest time in your partner, that doesn\u2019t make you a tortured slave as many blue pilled women think. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNot believing in these fallacies will save you from being a spinster, from a lot of stress and bad decisions, knowing your worth in a healthy realistic way will help you build a beautiful relationship with the right person.\n\nI would love to know what you all think, and if I made any mistakes, let me know too, thank you!\n\nIf you want to where aaaaall this came from [Check my references out](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1btdV4O3YjQmHnQ7Fgngjjf1zYF6GKxsKEJmBAD_aeQA\/edit?usp=sharing)","title":"Analyzing the fallacy \u201cI won\u2019t settle for less than I deserve\u201d","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pa15m8\/analyzing_the_fallacy_i_wont_settle_for_less_than\/"}

As previously stated, it is intended to offer hope and guidance for any lady who wants to implement the RPW philosophy in her life but feels she may have arrived too late.  This will be most applicable to ladies **ages 25 and up.**  \n***\n**One question that comes up here a lot is: \u201cWhere do I find the right guy?\u201d** I\u2019m sorry if my response to this isn\u2019t original or inspiring, but I think it\u2019s worth reiterating:\n\n1. Connections through family and friends. The caveat to this is that you should only take recommendations from family or friends who are sane, are in healthy relationships themselves, and who you trust will give you advice that\u2019s in your best interest.\n2. Community organizations (church, local political action groups, local volunteer groups)\n3. Hobbies and activities (local coed sports\u2019 leagues, outdoor adventure groups, MeetUps)\n4. Online relationship services like Match.com or eHarmony that require people to pay for membership, complete a lengthy, in-depth personality profile, and reveal matches based on compatibility. \n\nI advise against bars and nightclubs because they are not conducive to meaningful connections and the \u201cmeat market\u201d atmosphere is demoralizing, especially if you\u2019re not naturally outgoing. The exception to this would be if you\u2019re going to see live music or partake in a style of dance (swing dancing, country western, etc.). Even if you don\u2019t meet anyone, you will still have fun. If you do meet someone, you will at least have one common interest.\n\nI also advise against free sites\/apps like Tinder; men take more time and consideration to placing an order on GrubHub than they do about picking matches on these apps. Women over 25 are almost always at a disadvantage, even if they\u2019re better looking than most women their junior.\n\nRelevant anecdote: One of my husband\u2019s friends is conventionally handsome, charming, and successful man in his late 30s who is constantly dating, yet complains about how he can\u2019t find anyone serious with whom to settle down and start a family.  The reason for this became very apparent when my husband and I watched him browse a free dating app.\n\nHe swiped left on a perfectly fit and lovely 30-year-old woman whose profile pic was a flattering shot of her hiking a mountain because her forehead was \u201cslightly large\u201d (we had no idea what he was talking about). Yet he swiped right on a 22-year-old doing a standing split in a thong bikini whose face was barely visible.  If given only 3 seconds, a picture, and an age, the penis makes the choice.\n\n**Another question we\u2019ve heard a million times (and probably asked ourselves at one point or another) is this: \u201cI\u2019m beautiful, fit, intelligent, and have a great job, etc. etc. why won\u2019t anyone date me?\u201d** Whenever I see this type of question posted on RPW, my first thought is, \u201cYou\u2019re a stranger on the Internet; how the hell should I know?!\u201d But my usual response is that you are: \n \n1. Completely oblivious to your own faults\n2. You don\u2019t know how to demonstrate your value in a way that is meaningful to men\n3. A combination of both\n\nTo address Problem #1, time spent in Nun Mode (as discussed in Part II) is a great opportunity for introspection. When you are alone with your own thoughts and are dealing with people outside of a romantic context, you gain a clearer perspective on your personal flaws and your failures when interacting with others.\n\n**As for showing your value to men,** I will once again repeat the key advice from Parts I and II: **The most challenging thing about becoming an RPW is changing your focus from what you can get out of men to what you can offer them.** The Blue Pill Woman (BPW) looks at the list of all her qualities, feels entitled to be universally appreciated by all men, and becomes bitter and frustrated when that doesn\u2019t happen. The RPW, on the other hand, is concerned only with the opinion of the right man and thinks of her qualities in terms of what she can provide him.\n\n**The key to changing how you act (i.e. showing your value) is changing how you think.** Here are some examples of how to shift from a BPW mindset to an RPW mindset:\n\nBPW thinking: \u201cI have an awesome career and make a ton of money! Men are intimidated by my accomplishments and independence.\u201d\nRPW thinking: \u201cI want to share my success with my partner. I can channel the hard work and dedication I\u2019ve demonstrated in my professional life toward building our shared future. If we choose for me to stay home after we have kids, he can be confident that I am willing and able to support myself and the family in the event that something happened to him.\u201d\n\nBPW thinking: \u201cI\u2019m so intelligent. Surely men are impressed with how I can apply Nietzsche quotes to absolutely anything.\u201d\nRPW thinking: \u201cI can keep up with the flow of his ideas and provide valuable insights in our discussions. He also knows that he can trust my judgment.\u201d\n\nBPW thinking: \u201cI do spin class 5x a week, yoga every night, train with Raoul every Thursday, and could probably deadlift that coed at the end of the bar who hasn\u2019t bought her own drink all night. What the hell?!\u201d\nRPW thinking: \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to be attractive\u2014and remain so!\u2014for my future mate. I want us to have a long and healthy life together.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I think it\u2019s important to address **two common mistakes that newfound RPWs make when it comes to demonstrating their value to potential mates.**  Both have been covered by Points 4-6 in the brilliant post [Dating for the Modern Woman]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/709i04\/dating_for_the_modern_woman\/) by \/u\/vanBeethovenLudwig, but I think they are worth revisiting here.\n\n**The first mistake is the overemphasis on showing off your domestic prowess.** One bit of advice that I think is greatly overused in this subreddit when people ask about how to win a man over is \u201cYou should cook and clean for him, and show him what an awesome wifey you can be!\u201d This isn\u2019t particularly useful initial dating advice (especially to the older RPW) because:\n\n* **Being able to cook, clean and run a household is the absolute bare minimum of being a functioning adult.** The mature men in your dating pool have likely been doing these things for themselves for a while, and if they don\u2019t care to do so, they can always hire a maid who isn\u2019t entitled to half their money and assets in the event they get sick of her. So while it\u2019s great that you are adept at the domestic arts, that shouldn\u2019t be your primary selling point.\n* **The early days of dating are for courtship and for vetting.**  Offering the \u201cWife Experience\u201d before you\u2019re in a committed relationship is almost as bad as sex on the first date. Why should he appreciate labor that he has done nothing to earn?  Where is the excitement and challenge of romancing you when you\u2019re elbows-deep in his laundry every time you visit (much like his mother)?\n\n**The second mistake is expending more effort than you\u2019re receiving.** This is a common pitfall for all women, but RPWs who are approaching the Wall are most vulnerable to it because they\u2019re trying to compensate for years of selfishness and\/or feel desperate to secure a commitment and marriage.\n\nDo you initiate most of your calls and texts? Are you constantly rearranging your schedule to suit his? If you live far apart, are you always visiting him? Do you hold back from expressing your opinions about anything because you\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll disapprove?\n\nSeriously, cut that out. If you don\u2019t treat your time and energy as valuable, men won\u2019t either.\n\n**Lastly, I will address the importance of vetting your friends.** Taking the Red Pill isn\u2019t just about changing your approach to romantic relationships; it\u2019s a fundamental shift in your values. Unfortunately, it\u2019s likely that some of the people you\u2019re close to will not be supportive of the changes you\u2019re trying to implement.\n\nAlso, for better or for worse, your friends are a reflection of you. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re as wholesome, pretty and traditional as [Donna Reed]( https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donna_Reed); if you\u2019re constantly surrounded by feminist battle-axes and\/or aging party girls, you will give men the impression that you are the same way.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should only be friends with women who share your outlook and opinions; however, you need to be willing to cut out those who are a toxic influence on your life and (either actively or simply by association) will sabotage your efforts toward self-improvement.\n\n***\n\nThis is the last installment for single ladies before I move on to Married\/LTR Women \u201cLate to the Red Pill.\u201d\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year!\n\n","title":"For Single Ladies \u201cLate to the Red Pill\u201d Part III: Finding Your Man, Showing Your Value, Vetting Your Friends","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/7ltc5r\/for_single_ladies_late_to_the_red_pill_part_iii\/"}

Did my husband start for work this morning in a better frame of mind for having married me, or would he have been happier as a single man or married to someone else? \nRemember, as you ask this question and apply your own answer, that we are talking about business; hard, practical business where intentions do not count. You may love your husband dearly, but if the results of your love are not constructive, you must write the word FAILURE across the record. \n2. Do I always treat my job just as seriously as if I were working in an office for a monthly salary? \nSome wives feel that it makes no difference if they linger so long over bridge or cocktails or shopping or whatever in the afternoon that they are unable to prepare a suitable meal for their husbands in the evening.\n3. Have I grown in poise and interests like the wives of my husband's associates and superiors?\nWives who keep up with the procession are an asset; those who fail to grow are a liability.\n4. Can I talk in the same terms as his associates and their wives? \nThis indicates how carefully you have maintained your interest in the source of your income, and how accustomed you are to expressing yourself.\n5. Do I dress and act like the wives of the business associates and superiors of my husband? \nYou place a heavy handicap upon your effectiveness if your husband cannot be proud of you in the inevitable comparisons with other wives in his organization.\n6. Do I entertain with reasonable frequency the people who are in a position to help my husband in business, or is our social life planned wholly for my own amusement? \nPerhaps this question should read, \"How long since I have entertained So-and-So?\" You may be surprised to find that months have slipped away without your having done a single stroke of good for your husband socially. \n7. Do I limit our social engagements during the week to those which will not take essential energy from the job, or do I feel that my husband \"owes\" me constant amusement when he is not actually at the office?\nAs employers pile responsibility upon your husband, more and more care must be used in the allocation of time to social affairs. You may be able to rest the next day, but business does not permit husbands to rest on the job. \n8. Do I act as a balance wheel, cheering him intelligently when he is tired or discouraged, or do I rub him the wrong way on such occasions?\n If your husband does not share with you his disappointments, it is almost invariably because you have not qualified yourself to share them. \n9. Do I try to smooth things out after unpleasant discussions\u2014as I would if a new dress or theatre party were at stake? Many married persons have an uncanny capacity for making miserable the objects of their affection. It is said that the course of true love never did run smooth, but the wise husband or wife will not unnecessarily roughen it. \n10. Do I carry my share of responsibility, or do I save up all the petty annoyances for our dinner-table conversation? \nWives who complain that their husbands are silent during dinner have usually good reason to overhaul the quality of their own conversation. Don't bore him with your fight with the grocer or the catty things Mrs. X said at bridge or afternoon tea.","title":"From \"The Good Housekeeping Marriage Book\" published in 1938.

I\u2019m certainly no expert but I\u2019m a physician and married to my husband for 6 years (together for 8) and I wish I had some of this advice when younger. I am mid thirties and have been a doctor for 8 years. (Some of this advice likely applies to other professional women who want to balance a professional life with family life). \n\n\nStrategy:\n\n-You\u2019re time poor and probably perpetually stressed, this works against you in the dating market. People obviously want a partner who is available to them and mostly pleasant. Try manage this as much as possible as a matter of priority. Have an organised schedule and see a psychologist if needed to manage your stress. \n\n-Make time to exercise. You will feel better and look better.\n\n-Eat healthily. I know it\u2019s hard but meal prep healthy meals otherwise you just end up eating crap from the vending machines at the hospital. \n\n-Maximise your appearance. You\u2019re competing with women who have a lot more time than you to go to the gym and get facials etc etc. Invest in things that \u201clast\u201d, for example teeth whitening, laser facials, Botox, eyebrow laminating. Look your best so that even if you\u2019re not in makeup you look presentable. \n\n-Don\u2019t talk about your work or study all the time. You might find it the most fascinating thing ever but save it for your colleagues. \n\n-Have a life outside of medicine. Easier said than done, but even going for a hike every now and then keeps you grounded and more interesting a person. Find some other hobbies or interests, if your whole life is medicine, then you alienate all men who aren\u2019t doctors. \n\n-Be mindful to not be an arrogant douche. Communication in hospitals can be blunt and rude at times, do not let this seep into your personal life. \n\n-You see some really sad and serious things in medicine. Be prepared for this, debrief as needed. Accept that you will lose some of your childlike \u201cinnocence\u201d and that your new path will be one of feminine emotional maturity. \n\n\nIdeal men:\n\n-Self assured and comfortable guys. They\u2019re comfortable within their area of expertise, whatever that may be.  Keep an open mind re this. \n\n-Similar education level to you but this is def not necessary. I have doctor friends who have married builders etc and they are very happy. Personally, I married an attorney. \n\n-Ideally someone who earns similar to you or more. I realise this is an old fashioned view but I do think it make the dynamic easier.\n\n\nMen to avoid:\n\n-Men who seem intimidated or insecure about the whole doctor thing. Don\u2019t fight it, don\u2019t question yourself, just justify or try change their mind. Their attitude usually comes out in weird little comments. \n\n-Conversely, men who seem a little too attracted to the whole medical thing. They\u2019re probably after your money or they are raging narcissists who want the associated \u201cstatus\u201d of a doctor wife. \n\n-Men who don\u2019t respect or even like what you do, ie. they never ask about your work or find your work stories gross. \n\n-Men (usually in the sciences) who tried to get into med school but failed. Recipe for disaster. Trust me. \n\n-Men who seem okay with it but complain bitterly about your hours. Orange flag. This depends on what your future hours are likely to be like and whether they can hang on during your University and residency years. I currently work part time and my hubby prefers this much more as do I. \n\n -Some men strangely seem extremely bothered by the whole thing and claim that they don\u2019t like female doctors, and they even claim to have dated or apparently knew some back in the day. Some men love to claim they \u201cchose\u201d to not pursue certain women for example \u201cI dated some models and they were all crazy haha\u201d the point of the story being they want to demonstrate they\u2019re high enough value to attract them but chose not to continue with such situations like it\u2019s some kind of weird flex. Stories probably aren\u2019t even true and even if they are, they\u2019re not in your potential dating pool. A man wouldn\u2019t tolerate a woman bad mouthing his job or his \u201ctype\u201d and neither should you. Politely disengage and leave the conversation. Avoid. \n\n\nHow to meet men:\n\n-Apps, I\u2019ve never been on them as I\u2019ve been with my partner for ages but I feel they are the mainstay of dating now. So I can\u2019t really comment on it but just be careful and I get the impression you need to vet very carefully. There\u2019s probably other posts with better advice on here about it. \n\n-Through friends. My hubby worked with my friend and she introduced us! If you\u2019re actively looking then don\u2019t be shy to put that out there with friends and family you trust. If they\u2019re vetted by them then they have to be at least half decent right?\n\n-At work. Fellow doctors, physios etc are always an option. Keep in mind that male physicians are highly valued in the dating market and will have women throwing themselves at them. You have to see it to believe it. You can\u2019t get mad about it, it\u2019s just how life works. You will need to bring your A game. \n\n-At University\/Med school. Now this is a good option, just make sure you have proper commitment before he becomes a graduated doctor. It\u2019s kind of a joke within the profession how men have a \u201cmed school girlfriend\u201d then break up as soon as they\u2019re a doctor and have women all over them. Their options have immediately expanded whereas yours haven\u2019t. \n\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n\n-Thinking \u201cI will date after med school!\u201d then \u201cI will date after residency\u201d then \u201cI will date after fellowship\u201d. No. Start dating now, make time for it. Put it into your schedule. \n\n-Thinking you will just date doctors once you graduate and start working. Unless you\u2019re very very attractive, the odds are stacked against you. Most of the male doctors are firmly taken although there are some workaholics floating around who just haven\u2019t prioritised dating. There\u2019s def older doctors as an option (likely divorced with kids). \n\n-Neglecting your physical and mental health due to studies or work. \n\n-Losing your femininity. Keep mindful of this.\n\n-Us female doctors I find often have too much empathy and this leads to taking on broken men that we shouldn\u2019t.  I\u2019ve seen some horrendous choices made by my friends who are otherwise very clever and sensible women. This of course isn\u2019t unique to us but it seems quite bad from what I\u2019ve seen. \n\n\nMiscellaneous tips:\n\n-Meal prep or buy a meal box plan to save time but still eat healthily \n\n-Invest in workout stuff you can use at home, eg a treadmill and yoga mat etc\n\n-Make time for your friends and family as much as you can, even if it\u2019s just face time calls etc \n\n-Night shift is the actual worst. Not sure what to suggest but be prepared \n\n -Consider freezing your eggs\n\n\nHappy to be PM by any female medical students or doctors, seems there\u2019s a few of us here xo","title":"Dating tips for female medical students and doctors","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/132hyno\/dating_tips_for_female_medical_students_and\/"}

Truly, it feels insulting to be told you are not needed, as if it meant being useless! The impartial and non-sentimental reality though is that men have two arms, two legs and opposable fingers, not missing anything detrimental to their survival. In the past, men didn't need women to wash their clothes as they marched for months or years on end in armies. In the future, men might not even need women to carry children, if artificial wombs will be a thing. *But don't we want to be needed, as women?* Hmmm \u2026 why? Is dependency what should keep men next to us? Is value attributed only to that which is strictly necessary to function?\n\nAt the same time, it is quite obvious to everybody that men really *really* want women, starting with wanting the simple act of heterosexual sexs and hook ups, up to wanting a lifelong marriage with a high value woman to raise children together. A lot of men's actions spin around getting women, keeping women or making them happy. Teenagers learn to play guitar to impress their crush, young men buy fancy cars to get the eye of a potential mate and those past their prime still struggle to remember anniversaries and bring flowers to make their wife of twenty years smile. \n\n*Which of these processes do you want to be the subject of? Need or want? Which of these forces makes you more valuable as a human being?*\n\nIn his \"Art of Rhetoric\", Aristotle presents the two ways in which you can argue over an object's greater value over another. \"\\[...\\] gold is a better thing than iron, though less useful\" can say one side, while the other can argue \"what is often useful surpasses what is seldom useful, hence the saying: The best of things is water.\" . What do you want to be? Gold, iron or water? \n\nA bitter truth is that dependency breeds resentment. If something which we need is inaccessible to us, we feel frustrated. As little children it is of no bother to us that we need our parents to feed us, but as we mature, needing parents for money becomes a source of stress. After we gain independence from our families, we never pay any mind to the groceries we need, but we put a lot of value into getting that gadget\/bag\/car that we want and getting it with our own means. If there is an institution gatekeeping something we need (for example, a healthcare institution charging you obscene amounts for a life-saving drug), do we have more respect for it or less? \n\n\"One definition of good\" Aristotle also notes \"is what beings that acquire understanding will choose in any given case\". \"Good\" then is not something that is needed, it is something that is chosen without constraint. Isn't that a much more wonderful alternative?","title":"Men don't need women - and that's wonderful","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ohgjcr\/men_dont_need_women_and_thats_wonderful\/"}

Because of some problems I had with my mom I\u2019ve always told myself I was going to be the best wife and mother I\u2019d ever seen. So from an early age I believed in the philosophies here. My first serious relationship really brought these qualities out in me \u2014 but I\u2019ve never been able to pull it off perfectly. I think I\u2019ve finally found the reason for that, and it\u2019s insecurity. \n\nInsecurity is childish but unfortunately it is not easily outgrown. I\u2019ve always been a little insecure about one thing or another, and I would tell myself I\u2019d never let it negatively affect my relationships. But it does, and while women cover up their insecurities in numerous ways it always surfaces, even in healthy relationships with zero infidelity. An insecure woman asks more from her partner than he needs to give, or thinks he needs to give. An insecure woman might think she needs more reassurance, recognition, and attention than is actually healthy and normal. And she may think that there is something wrong with the relationship when her needs for reassurance aren\u2019t met. Insecure women often fail to acknowledge what their partner feels because they can only see what they themselves lack.  And this leads to arguments \u2014 about effort, miscommunication, and the classic \u201cwho cares more\u201d. \n\nThe sad thing is is that it is so hard for someone who deeply feels like they are not good enough to simply change their behavior. Nobody wants to be too needy. What works for me in the moment is when I feel like I am being too needy and it\u2019s causing a problem with my boyfriend, I just shut up. Even if I want to say more.

The infidelity and the promiscuity can have an important impact on individuals and on intimate relationships (Silva et al. n.d., Vangelisti and Gerstenberger 2004). For example, the infidelity is one of the most common reasons for divorce and couple therapy (Glass and Wright 1992). In addition, promiscuity is known to have a negative effect on healthy living (Okafor and Duru 2010).\n\n.\n\n>**Some authors defend that infidelity may come as a consequence of promiscuity, and that frequently both concepts go side by side (Feldman and Cauffman 1999, Mark et al. 2011). Promiscuity can be understood as the willingness to engage in sexual activities with several partners, have casual sex and get involved in sexual activities sooner rather than later (Jones and Paulhus 2012)**\n\n.\n\n>Feldman and Cauffman (1999) analyzed a sample of 417 college students and found that individuals that show permissive behaviors, associated with increased number of sexual partners are more prone to engage in infidelity. Similarly, Barta and Kiene (2005) conducted a study with 432 college students, 120 of whom mentioned past infidelity behaviors. Their results showed that those who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation tend to report a sexual motive for being unfaithful.\n\n>Sexual promiscuity was significantly positively correlated with emotional promiscuity [r(356) = .261, p < .001], as well with sexual infidelity [r(323) = .595, p < .001] and emotional infidelity [r(323) = .676, p < .001], indicating that sexually promiscuous participants also tend to be emotionally promiscuous, and sexual[ly] and emotional[ly] unfaithful.\n\n.\n\n>In terms of the sexual domain, results showed that there is also a positive correlation between sexual promiscuity and sexual infidelity, stating that individuals that tend to be more sexually promiscuous also tend to be more sexually unfaithful. These results support our second hypothesis.\n\nPinto, R., & Arantes, J.

Individuals with a more restricted sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who have a more unrestrictedsociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness\n\nFrom <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sociosexual_orientation> \n\nX\n\n>The genetic theory hypothesizes that female sociosexual variation reflects women's \"decisions\" regarding how much commitment to trade for genetic quality. Women who value commitment much more than male quality have a restricted sociosexual orientation, and women with opposite preferences have an unrestricted orientation. This variation has been hypothesized to be maintained by frequency- dependent selection (Gangestad & Simpson, 1990).\n\n.\n\n>**approximately half of the men and women in the top (withinsex) quintiles of sociosexuality had been sexually unfaithful to a steady partner; this was more than a tenfold increase over the corresponding rate for people in the bottom quintiles.** Sexual infidelity is a common cause of divorce cross-culturally (Buss, 1994)\n\n*Do individual differences in sociosexuality represent genetic or environmentally contingent strategies?

In a study of supposedly exclusive dating couples, it was found that individuals exhibiting an \u2018unrestricted\u2019 sociosexual orientation (SO) were significantly more likely to pursue extra-pair involvement (Seal, Agostinelli, & Hannett, 1994). Individuals are said to be unrestricted if they score high on the Sociosexual Orientation Index (SOI). Items on this scale include a question tapping whether the respondent feels that love is a prerequisite for sexual relations with a partner, the number of \u2018one-night stands\u2019 a respondent has had, and how many partners he or she hopes to have in the next year (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991).\n\n.\n\n>A preliminary ANOVA analysis revealed that individuals reporting a past history of infidelity tended to have a greater number of past sexual partners than those without a history of infidelity\n\n.\n\n>individuals with a history of infidelity, compared with those without, have a relatively unrestricted SO.\n\nBarta, W. D., & Kiene, S. M. (2005). *Motivations for infidelity in heterosexual dating couples: The roles of gender, personality differences, and sociosexual orientation.* Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 22(3), 339-360.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0265407505052440\nFrom <http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/record\/2005-07434-003>\n\nX\n\n>Individuals with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation (SO) are less committed to their romantic relationships and more likely to engage in infidelity\n\n.\n\n>BECAUSE OF THE PREVALENCE and consequences of infidelity (e.g., Vangelisti & Gerstenberger, 2004; Weiderman, 1997), being able to predict extradyadic behavior is important. One known predictor is sociosexual orientation (SO). SO is an individual difference that reflects one\u2019s beliefs and behaviors toward sex and is measured on a continuum ranging from restricted to unrestricted (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). Those with a restricted SO prefer to engage in sexual behaviors within the context of a close and committed romantic relationship, whereas those with an unrestricted SO do not need a committed relationship in order to have sex. Not surprisingly, an unrestricted SO has been associated with a greater willingness to engage in infidelity when using either self-report (Barta & Kiene, 2005; Ostovich & Sabini, 2004) or behavioral measures (Seal, Agostinelli, & Hannett, 1994). Previous studies have shown that those with an unrestricted SO are generally less committed to their romantic partners (Jones 1998; Simpson & Gangestad, 1991), and low commitment is often a predictor of infidelity (Drigotas, Safstrom, & Gentilia, 1999). Similarly, those with an unrestricted SO are often looking for new, attractive partners (Simpson, Wilson, & Winterheld, 2004).\n\n>Thus, it was **predicted that SO would be positively related to various types of infidelity, such that individuals with an unrestricted SO would be more likely to engage in the three types of infidelity previously identified by Wilson, Mattingly, Clark, Weidler, and Bequette (2011); Ambigous (e.g., dancing with an extradyadic partner), Deceptive (e.g., lying to one\u2019s partner), and Explicit (e.g., sexual intercourse with an extradyadic partner)**. Further, this relationship was predicted to be mediated by commitment, such that individuals with an unrestricted SO would have lower commitment, which would in turn lead to an increased likelihood of engaging in infidelity.\n\n*Sociosexual orientation, commitment, and infidelity: a mediation analysis.*\nBrent A. Mattingly, Eddie M. Clark, Daniel J. Weidler, Melinda Bullock, Jana Hackathorn, Katheryn Blankmeyer\nJ Soc Psychol. 2011 May-Jun; 151(3): 222\u2013226.\nFrom <https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/pmid\/21675178\/citedby\/?tool=pubmed> \n\nX\n\n>one plausible explanation is that humans actually consist of a mix of short-term (promiscuous) and long-term (monogamous) mating phenotypes. The extent to which any one individual pursues a short- term mating strategy (\u2018unrestricted\u2019 strategy involving promiscuous mating with multiple partners) or a long-term mating strategy (\u2018restricted\u2019 strategy favouring the formation of exclusive and extended pair- bonds) has been referred to as their \u2018sociosexual orientation\u2019\n\n.\n\n>We tested the hypothesis that there are distinct mating strategy phenotypes in both men and women using two large datasets: a North American and British sample of 595 individuals who completed the sociosexual orientation inventory (SOI-R) [13] and a British sample of 1314 individuals whose 2D : 4D digit ratios were measured. The SOI-R indexes an individual\u2019s psychological degree of sexual promiscuity on a continuum running from restricted (monogamous) to unrestricted (promiscuous).\n\n.\n\n>Modelling confirmed the existence of two phenotypes within each sex, one of low (restricted) sociosexuality and the other of high (unrestricted) sociosexuality. High-sociosexuality males make up a slightly larger proportion of the male distribution in each case, and low-sociosexuality females make up a slightly larger proportion of the female distributions (table 1).\n\n.\n\n>Overall, our results suggest that the proportional split in males slightly favours an unrestricted (short- term) mating strategy, with a 57 : 43 split on average for the three datasets, whereas females have a reversed split (47 : 53). However, the mixing proportions in the 2D : 4D digit ratio dataset suggest that a slightly higher proportion of the unrestricted phenotype is present in both sexes (males approx. 62%, females approx. 50%).\n\n.\n\n>If the two phenotypes essentially represent stable and unstable pair-bonding predispositions (see Walum et al. [11]), we might expect there to be some tendency for assortative mating between the phenotypes. We might also predict that stable\u2013stable pairings are less likely to divorce than other pairings, with unstable\u2013unstable pairings having the shortest durations. The existence of two phenotypes raises a number of further evolutionary questions.\n\n>Previous research has found that female sociosexuality is more responsive to environmental shifts than male sociosexuality [4,22], and our data confirm this: while both sexes exhibit a shift (towards a restricted strategy in males, but towards unrestricted in females), the magnitude of the shift is larger in women than in men. While there is strong evidence that additive genetic factors best predict adult sociosexuality [23], differences in behaviour are in part likely to reflect cultural or environmental fine tuning of underlying genetic strategies in response to local circumstances as each sex tries to maximize overall fitness.\n\nWlodarski R, Manning J, Dunbar RIM. 2015 *Stay or stray?

However, there are considerable differences by marriage cohort. **For all three cohorts, women who married as virgins had the lowest divorce rates by far.** Eleven percent of virgin marriages (on the part of the woman, at least) in the 1980s dissolved within five years. This number fell to 8 percent in the 1990s, then fell again to 6 percent in the 2000s. For all three decades, the women with the second lowest five-year divorce rates are those who had only one partner prior to marriage. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that these partners reflected women\u2019s eventual husbands.\n\n.\n\n>The highest five-year divorce rates of all are associated with marrying in the 2000s and having ten or more premarital sex partners: 33 percent.\n\n.\n\n>2000s: Results are hazard ratios indicating increased odds of divorce compared to reference category of 0 partners (total abstinence before marriage).\n\n- 0: --\n- 1: 2.54\n- 2: 4.05\n- 3: 3.5\n- 4-5: 3.18 \n- 6-9: 3.22 \n- 10+: 4.25\n\nFrom <https:\/\/ifstudies.org\/blog\/counterintuitive-trends-in-the-link-between-premarital-sex-and- marital-stability>\n\nX\n\n- <30% of marriages stable for women with 5+ non-marital sexual partners\n\n- *Women were defined as having a stable marriage if they were currently married and had been in that same marriage for at least five years.

(2003). *The harmful effects of early sexual activity and multiple sexual partners among women: A book of charts*. Washington: The Heritage Foundation.\n\nX\n\n>One twin study looking at a number of scaled sociosexual behaviors found a similar heritability for number of sexual partners in male and female twins (Bailey et al., 2000); another study showed divorce to be approximately 50% heritable among women (Jockin et al., 1996).\n\n*Genetic influences on female infidelity and number of sexual partners in humans: a linkage and association study of the role of the vasopressin receptor gene (AVPR1A)*.\nLynn F.

Multiple premarital sexual partners may indicate less commitment to the idea of a permanent relationship with one individual. Multiple sexual partners may also weaken the marital bond by heightening awareness of alternatives to one\u2019s marital partner as sources of sexual intimacy and fulfillment. Similar to the case for premarital sex, multiple coresidential unions prior to marriage may indicate a range of personal attitudes and beliefs that might undermine the stability of unions\n\n.\n\n>However, either premarital cohabitation or sex that occurs with someone other than one\u2019s spouse is expected to be related to an increased risk of marital dissolution. These individuals are either selected on characteristics that increase the risk of divorce or their experiences with disrupted unions lead to destabilizing influences on marriage.\n\n.\n\n>The effects for premarital sex in Model 2 indicate that it is only women whose first sex was with someone other than her husband who experience an increased risk of marital disruption (114%). The results in Model 3, which includes the effects of both premarital cohabitation and premarital sex (compared with women who did not cohabit before marriage and did not engage in premarital sex), show that the risk of marital dissolution is higher when the woman cohabited twice (by about 28%) and when her first sex was with someone other than her husband (by about 109%). Combining premarital cohabitation and premarital sex in the same model reduces the effect of having cohabited solely with one\u2019s husband to nonsignificance. This pattern results because women who cohabited with their husband only are more likely than women who did not cohabit before marriage to have had first sex with someone other than their husband (73% vs. 41%; data not shown). That is, for these women, it is not the fact that they cohabited before marriage that is important for marital dissolution; it is the fact that they had at least one other sexually intimate relationship prior to marrying.\n\n.\n\n>having at least one other intimate relationship prior to marriage is linked to an increased risk of divorce (from 53% to 166%). There is a substantially higher risk of marital dissolution if the woman both had sex with another man and cohabited with him (166% vs. 53%\u2013 119% for other patterns of premarital relationships involving someone other than one\u2019s husband, a difference that is statistically significant). That is, there is an interaction between having multiple premarital sexual partners and cohabiting multiple times.\n\n.\n\n>women who have more than one intimate premarital relationship who have an elevated risk of marital disruption.

He\u2019s only 22, and I have the utmost confidence in his ability to achieve whatever he wants in life. He has ambition, a powerful work ethic, humility, integrity, and a high capacity for sacrifice and ability to lead.

It's sort of like feminine within masculine. \n\nBeta traits are important to women because to build a family and raise children you need the steadiness, nurturing and soft side to emerge. Dangerous fun might be titillating and arousing, but it's destructive to raising a family. \n\nThis creates a big problem. You need the steady commitment and nurturing of the beta in order to have a stable, long lasting marriage. However, women naturally find such men boring and that means diminishing desire for sex. This can lead to frustration and resentment from the husband and boredom and unhappiness from the wife. Both can lead to adultery, a miserable marriage and\/or divorce. \n\nOTOH, choosing an alpha male isn't simple either. Alpha men have a lot of options and aren't necessarily inclined to settle down with any one woman. They're able to have many flings along with all their other adventures. \n\n**The default setting**\n\nAnyone who is a parent to boys and girls will probably know that they are very different even from a very young age. Boys are much more rambunctious, wild and destructive as toddlers. When they grow older, they may not like girls because girl germs. They keep developing their masculine self if they're allowed to and aren't shamed or discouraged by their parents and teachers. \n\nAll this changes the minute they hit puberty. All the macho independence flies out the window and the boys become the biggest simps, melting into soft butter in the presence of an eligible female! This is because it's hardwired into men to desire women with this insane level of desire, to be soft and kind to women, to be giving and caring to women and to bend over backwards to fulfill her every wish and desire. These traits make him a beta male and are not good for the female sex drive. This is the default setting. \n\nMen can learn to be more masculine, but this does not come naturally. There's no such thing as a natural alpha. You may think he's a natural because you met him once he's been in this world for 2-3 decades or more, once he's been through many rejections in life, once he's had time to hone his masculine side. All this comes with hard work, none of it is natural. Naturally, he's programmed to be smitten with immense sexual desire for the female and to do whatever she wants in the hopes of the actualization of this desire. \n\n**Who ought to change?** \n\nThis question really deserves it's own post, but the short answer is - both of you need to change. He needs to go against his nature of bending over backwards to pleas you to start standing up to you and to stop being a pushover to your every whim. You need to go against your nature of making demands on him to fulfill said whims, of criticizing him when he doesn't get it right or of nagging him when he doesn't move fast enough to do what you think he needs to do. \n\nHe needs to go against his nature of repressing all emotions and to be a little vulnerable and establish emotional intimacy with you. You in turn need to find sexual appeal in the things he does for you by viewing them as acts of strength. You need to be appreciative of his steady support, caring and nurturing and never take it for granted. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nMarriage requires a fine balance of many opposing traits. Harmony is when such balance is achieved. Both men and women need to recalibrate towards the middle in order to achieve such balance. This is something our great grandparents knew, but this wisdom has been somewhat forgotten in an age where we all expect the other person to make all the accommodations. \n\nSo if you're ever thinking to yourself - my husband is so beta (or any other trait that you find undesirable), can I get him to change? You need to do two things right away. 1. Look in the mirror and see what **you** can change. 2. Learn to view his trait from a different angle, an angle that might make the same trait look appealing and attractive. \n\nIf you need to look at the cup being half full instead of half empty, perhaps your cup is twice as large as what it ought to be....","title":"The default male setting is beta.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8aqzf5\/the_default_male_setting_is_beta\/"}

Today I will write about an issue that keeps coming up on this sub as well as many others, an issue that causes many issues in life - male-female friendships. \n\n**I firmly believe that it's unnatural for men and women to be \"just friends\", that overcoming this nature is nearly impossible. I think that much heartache can be spared by understanding these truths**\n\nFriendship is a form of intimacy. Sexual bonding is a very different form of intimacy, the polar opposite to friendship. \n\n**Sexual intimacy** is the union of opposites. Men and women are worlds apart. Men and women - generally speaking - think, speak and behave completely differently. What may be interesting or exciting to one gender is weird or boring to the other gender. Naturally, we need a way to bring these opposites together for the continuation of our species. \n\nWhen an eligible man and woman come into the presence of one another, they instinctively act differently. Even if they're just two people sitting next to each other on the train, two people who don't say a word to one another, their body language will change in the presence of a suitor from the opposite sex. This is even more true if they do interact. An inter-gender interaction will be very different from a same gender interaction even when no sexual innuendo is present.\n\nWhen a man and a woman go out on a date: they'll each dress up, scent up and be on their best behavior. In order to bring these two opposites together, **each one must display the very best version of themselves**. \n\n**Friendship** OTOH, is the exact opposite. A group of guy friends hanging out may use colourful language, dirty jokes, burp, fart, punch each other for the heck of it and get into wrestling matches. A group of girl friends may squish 15 girls on a couch meant for 3, squeal and screech, talk for hours on end, bawl their eyes out over I'm not sure what, break into giggling fits and plenty of gossip. **In friendship, you're safe to display your very worst**. \n\nBoth of these forms of intimacy are very necessary. \n\nMen don't talk nearly as much as women do. Even when we talk, it's different, especially when it comes to emotions. Women like to talk things out, men like to fix things. Women like to feel the feelings, men like to resolve them. We each view the other as weird. [This youtube video] (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg) demonstrates this point beautifully. \n\nWith friends we're free to display the worst version of ourselves, but with our sexual partners it is likely to kill attraction. A guy who displays his insecurities or a girl who bawls her eyes out will have a harder time being attractive to their mates. (Of course there are many examples). \n\nWhen you're married, you get the whole package. The morning breath, the mood swings, the insecurities etc. However, we all know that minimising exposure to this side of ourselves is always a good idea. Sure, we need not feel self conscious about our morning breath, but we also need to brush our teeth at the earliest possible time to minimise our spouses exposure to our morning breath. **In sexual intimacy we need to display as much of our best selves and as little of our worst selves as possible.** \n\nA beta man is unattractive to a woman. To her, the guy is almost like a woman himself with all his feminine behavior.... Therefore, in her mind, he can be \"just a friend\" like all of her other friends from whom she'll seek emotional validation and other girly friend stuff. However, to the guy, he feels that he has a greater chance of getting into her pants or into a relationship with her if he'll be her friend first. He assumes that if he's there for her during all her emotional mood swings, seeing her during her absolute worst and being there for her through these times that she'll find him attractive. Oh the let down when he realizes that this will never happen.....\n\nWe all know that this guy is unattractive. We call him a beta orbitor. What isn't talked about enough is the dynamic behind this. She thinks he's just a friend because he's acting feminine like her girl friends while he thinks he's building sexual attraction by being soft and feminine because that's what he finds attractive! It's a recipe for disaster and plenty of heartache. The flip-side of this dynamic is that male-female friendship is nearly impossible. \n\nHere's [another youtube video] (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T_lh5fR4DMA) demonstrating how men realize that we can't be just friends while women think that \"just friends\" is possible. \n\nBefore I conclude, I need to clarify a point. The difference between friends and friendly. Everything I said in this post is about being friends. It goes without saying that men and women can and should be friendly to one another and to treat each other with respect and dignity. Being friendly isn't the same as being friends. I'm sure most of you know this differentiation, but I'm putting it out there because there's always someone who would pick on something like this. \n\nCheers!","title":"The great myth of male-female friendship.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/51oknp\/the_great_myth_of_malefemale_friendship\/"}

These friends would make snide comments about the Red Pill changes I was making to my life style, calling me a Stepford Wife, telling me I was too young to be tied down to this lifestyle, etc.\n\nI got a lot of really good advice, and I decided to sever these relationships. Because I had been friends with these women for a few years, I decided I owed it to them to give them some sort of closure and explain that we were 'over' as friends instead of just refusing to answer texts\/disappearing off the face of the Earth.\n\nAs a side note: Some people were wondering what changes I've made\/if their concern was justified. The changes I've made have been cooking more, spending more time on hair\/make up, losing weight, having more sex with my fiance and not allowing myself to use my disability as an excuse, and just generally trying to be a better partner in general. I was not doing anything drastic or dangerous, so their comments were hurtful and unwarranted.\n\nAnyways, I sat down with them and explained the issue - they were saying things that were cruel and disrespectful, and we no longer lived the same kind of life. \n\nThey spat back a lot of anger, a lot of hatred, and I think some of it was long-term simmering resentment that had been building up behind my back. I'm not surprised, I'm working as a full time writer\/artist and they're all struggling through grad school, I'm getting married in 10 months and they're sleeping around and crying about guys who don't call. They felt left behind, and it's a shame they couldn't handle it as adults.\n\nAnyways, my fiance and I have been going to some Meetup events and branching out. Our relationship feels healthier because I cut that negative influence out of my life and I refused to tolerate any more disrespect against my future husband.\n\nThanks again for all of your advice and kind words - much appreciated.

I thought it would be a great discussion to have here as we repeatedly get the question \u201chow do I vet\u201d and also how to effectively use dating apps as part of your dating strategy.\n\nThe question we have as women looking for a quality partner is: **how do I find a needle in a haystack?** Some women approach this by trying to remain causal, cool, not being so strict in what they are looking for, and opening up their options to people you wouldn't normally. This is what is recommended by some of our beloved RPW authors such as Laura Doyle and Lori Gottlieb \u2013 to accept dates with men who ask, even if they aren\u2019t your ideal, and see if something grows. To compromise.\n\nThe Burned Haystack Approach responds to **How do you find a needle in a haystack** with the answer: **You burn the haystack to the ground. What you are left with is the needle.** The 10 rules for this method (focused on online dating apps) is as follows:\n\n* **Rule 1:** The app is a tool; it\u2019s not a place to live.\n* **Rule 2:** Focus on messaging over scrolling\/swiping. Messaging is where you\u2019ll find the info. you really need.\n* **Rule 3:** No notifications.\n* **Rule #4** is called \u201cBlock to Burn.\u201d Block those you have interacted with but aren\u2019t a match to prevent them reoccurring in your feed.\n* **Rule #5:** No Fighting with Men.\n* **Rule #6:** Don\u2019t Be a Pen Pal.\n* **Rule #7:** Set your geography, but don\u2019t share your location. The intent of this is to avoid men who are looking for an easy hook up with someone physically close to them and therefore \"easy.\" A serious man will be ok putting in a little more effort to see you.\n* **Rule #8:** No \u201cludic looping\u201d and no \u201cattractions of deprivation\u201d. Ludic looping refers to the addiction to the gamification on dating apps (the boost you get from a match, endless swiping) and attractions of deprivation is similar to the RPW concept of \u201cabundance mentality\u201d, not getting overly attached to any one match simply because you feel there is no one else out there.\n* **Rule #9:** No men who can\u2019t plan the date.\n* **Rule #10:** Treat the process of online dating as a job search, not a takeout order.\n\nYou will see some RPW themes in the above rules such as a focus on self-care through protecting yourself from dating burnout or addiction, the idea of keeping an abundance mentality, and giving your time to men who display they can take the lead.\n\nHave you tried any of these approaches? What has worked? What hasn\u2019t?\n\n\n\n**Links below:**\n\n[Online dating was hell.

I'm sorry if these thoughts are scattered; I wrote this after a crying session in an attempt to sort these thoughts and fears out.  \n\n\nHistorically I'm not the type to cry too much, but I've been crying a lot lately. What's been on my mind is this dread of the future because I'm afraid I will never be loved, when being loved is pretty much the only thing I want out of life.  \n\n\nYou know how people say you should never wish to trade lives with anyone, because everyone has their own problems? I think that's wishful thinking. Some people live miserable lives. At the extreme end, some people live in warzones; they might be tortured before a violent death. Or some might fall prey to addiction, winding up homeless and dying of an overdose. These are objectively worse problems than many people with stable lives face; our hearts break for these people because we know that life is supposed to be better than that. Lately I've been thinking that maybe I'll be one of those people who lives a miserable life--while not to the extent that I'll die of an overdose or in a war, I think I might die having never been loved.  \n\n\nA few years ago, I read an article about a woman who died alone in her apartment while wrapping Christmas gifts, only for her corpse to be discovered years later. No one had thought to check up on her during that time. Where were the people she was wrapping gifts for? She died thinking and acting of others, but her love was not reciprocated. I think about this article often; when I'm in my apartment alone, I get anxious at the thought that someday that might be me. I have so much trouble sleeping.  \n\n\nI want love and community, and I feel like the family unit is how people achieve that these days in Western society. I was reading an online discussion recently about how people slowly begin to lose friends over the years if they remain single; their friends build families and make friends with the parenting community and find fulfillment in raising children, year by year leaving the singles behind. It's not on purpose--it's just hard to relate to people who aren't going through the same thing. Those friendships start to feel forced.  \n\n\nI'm 27. I want to be married. I want to have children. I feel like that's becoming rarer and rarer; I worry it will never happen to me. I was never the girl the guys all fawned over. Some have been interested over the years--in fact, I'm in a long term relationship right now, but he's never said he loves me, he's reluctant about marriage, and he's started saying he's no longer sure about wanting kids. Who knows what the future holds. When I think of the future, I imagine it either being with him and never being loved or being alone and never being loved.  \n\n\nMy friend proposed an idea to me: that when we're older, those of us ladies who aren't married all move in together and form a community of single Christian women. \"It'll be cool. I know so many cool Christian women, and statistically, we won't all get married. We could even raise children together.\" I think she is na\u00efve; I also think that though she proposed the idea, she will eventually get married and leave too, given that's she's beautiful and brilliant and charming.  \n\n\nI've been trying to work on myself. I've been working on losing weight (though it's easy to become apathetic and think that nothing I do matters and subsequently just eat whatever). I've been running and painting and studying foreign languages. I'm in a hiking group and a church group and I arrange friend dates with other women in my city. I'm in therapy and I'm on medication. I've read all the books that get recommended here multiple times and actively try to implement their teachings. I'm really really trying, but the future just seems so bleak.  \n\n\nDid things ever feel this bleak to any of you? How do you make peace with the very real possibility that you might never find someone, that you might never be loved?","title":"I so desperately want to be loved","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ty0gef\/i_so_desperately_want_to_be_loved\/"}

The laundry list often goes well beyond \u201c6 ft tall, 6 inches long, 6-figure salary,\u201d when just those three qualifiers alone have ruled out over 95% of the male population. \n\nWhile we often rightly tell each other to be more realistic if we ACTUALLY want to find success in our relationships, we also need to keep in mind that if you\u2019re *still on the market*, your best bet will not be your safest option, but **the best man you can actually land**. \n\n(If you\u2019re already married\/deeply committed and have already built a life with your man who hasn\u2019t done much else wrong, this is not for you. Your [best bet](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4tafpv\/what_to_do_when_your_captain_wont_lead\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is to make the best out of the situation you have chosen yourself.)\n\n-\n\nWhy not settle for a man who has made it clear from Day 1 that he\u2019s ready to commit to you, no questions asked? Why not overlook how he is kind of out of shape, has a timid and passive demeanor, or is unsuccessful (because god forbid you get labeled a gold digger), if he\u2019s nice to you and treats you kindly (for now)? Considering that many men don\u2019t even WANT to get married anymore, shouldn\u2019t you count your lucky stars that someone DOES and with YOU, regardless of their weaknesses?\n\nFor me, the answer is no. Life is full of tradeoffs, and there is no perfect option or strategy that doesn\u2019t have its own set of risks and downsides attached to it. The reason why I didn\u2019t settle is because the men from whom you easily obtain commitment from usually have a good amount of traits that are unattractive to the majority of women (exceptions found in extremely religious or conservative communities). As the gatekeepers of relationships, they wouldn\u2019t have given away their position for free unless they had very little leverage to work with. **These men have low pre-commitment risk, but much higher post-commitment risk**.\n\nThat means that while you don\u2019t have to worry at all about him running off for a better gal when you\u2019re still dating, and don\u2019t have much concern that he\u2019s stringing you on or just using you for sex, you DO have to worry about how to maintain attraction and respect for him AFTER you\u2019ve committed to each other. This is the rest of your life we\u2019re talking about here.\n\nCan you willingly submit to a man even if he often runs away from challenges with his tail between his legs instead of facing them head-on, with his best foot forward? To a man who communicates passive-aggressively because he\u2019s scared of your reaction? To a man who isn\u2019t trying very hard to be successful? To a man who cannot take charge himself and needs to defer to someone (often you or his mom) to make the decisions?\n\nFor women who committed to or married men that they\u2019re not attracted to, forcing themselves to be feminine and submissive to these men, and forcing themselves to have sex with these men to maintain their status quo [often feels as repulsive as rape itself](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheRedPill\/comments\/3fpefe\/every_unhappy_wife_is_a_rape_victim\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). It isn\u2019t really rape by any definition of the word, but it sure will ***feel*** like it when you HAVE to in order to keep your family, livelihood, and relationship intact. When you inevitably can\u2019t maintain this facade, your relationship may crumble from the dead bedroom, resentment, and\/or power struggle. And then you\u2019re back at square one, with years wasted, tons of baggage, and a whole lot of jadedness.\n\n-\n\nSo how do you escape this fate? You DON\u2019T settle. You only accept the best man that YOU can ACTUALLY land. Now, here\u2019s where you need to be realistic and honest with yourself: take a LONG look at yourself. Exactly how [physically attractive](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5qjy94\/low_smv_and_you\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) are you?

What exactly can you offer to the men you actually desire (who usually have many options and don\u2019t NEED to settle down just to have a steady stream of sex) that\u2019s [more enticing](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5pt40s\/the_five_faces_of_the_perfect_wife\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) than what he has going for himself without you?\n\nIf, after all this self-reflection, you realize are a well-rounded 7, for example, you should shoot *just* a bit higher for the men you date. Shoot too high, and risk getting alpha-widowed to a man who may NEVER commit to you because he will NEVER see you as a true option. \n\nIf you, as a 7, feel perfectly satisfied with your 7.5 match, that\u2019s great! Continue to treat him like The Man, and you\u2019ll get treated like His Woman. Not exactly satisfied with the men in your range? Luckily for you, RPW is a neat little toolbag of ways to increase your value as a woman. \n\nBecome an 8 or a 9 yourself (and this is in men\u2019s eyes, not your own), and you can up your ante a little bit. When you can offer men exactly what they so deeply want and desire out of women, on top of being in amazing shape and impeccably feminine, it\u2019s no longer impossible to keep a high pre-commitment risk, low post-commitment risk man that\u2019s very attractive to you (and to all the other women looking for the exact same thing).\n\n-\n\nIt\u2019s obvious why this type of man has a lot of pre-commitment risk. **But why does he have low post-commitment risk?** Because you\u2019re ACTUALLY strongly attracted to him, it comes SO much more naturally for you to respect him and submit to him. He\u2019s a good leader and a great Captain, which is why you felt so darn attracted to him in the first place. You can easily and gladly do your part because you picked a man who does his part well.\n\nIronically, IF you can successfully keep this kind of man, you\u2019re [better off in the long run](https:\/\/www.trp.red\/p\/whisper\/918) because you\u2019re much less likely to have to keep switching partners over and over. You found a keeper, and you convinced him to keep you too!\n\n**TLDR: Don\u2019t settle just to assure that someone commits to you. Low pre-commitment risk men have high post-commitment risks, risks that may result in a lot of misery for the both of you. Find the best man you can get, with high pre-commitment risk and low post-commitment risks, and be the girl of his dreams.

It's over 3 years old though and I wish I could comment my own tips and also that I could ask some of the women in that original post questions. So I decided to ask it again and revive the discussion!\n\nMy personal tips would be:\n\n* Consume collagen regularly. Preferably from bone broth, but gelatin and collagen powders are also fine;\n* Eat a diet high in animal products and in animal fats, and avoid processed foods, grains and sugar. Low carb high fat is optimal, it keeps your hormones way more stabilized than with constant blood sugar spikes;\n* Take Cod Liver Oil daily and eat beef liver weekly. Your skin (and the rest of your body) will thank you;\n* Drink enough water (I'm not about the 8 cups a day story. I'm 5'1 and 107lb, I very much doubt I need as much water as someone who is 5'7. Drink when you're thirsty. Eating less sugar will make you better at recognizing both thirst and hunger signals;\n* Have a good sleep routine. Avoiding too much screen time before bed, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day and getting 7-9 hours of sleep per night;\n* Don't over wash your face and don't take super hot showers all the time. You're dehydrating your skin this way. Moisturize daily. I have been using homemade Cold Cream (can give you guys the recipe if interested) for about a year and it's *by far* the best moisturizer I've ever used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 25.

So I wanted to summarize some of the concepts in these books, as well as talk about how I applied these concepts to achieve lovely results :)\n\n**But first, a snapshot of the \u201cbefore me\u201d:**\n\nPretty, loud, hung out with men, drank beers with them and cracked jokes, got into intellectual debates. Sound familiar? The problem wasn\u2019t that I was an overweight, obnoxious feminist. In this day and age, I was a normal girl. Many men asked me out, and my behavior was socially acceptable and encouraged. So I had no idea anything was wrong. Except I couldn\u2019t find a relationship I wanted. For 2 years. I was starting to go \u201cwhere have all the good men gone,\u201d until I snapped to my senses and circled back to this subreddit.\n\n**The vase metaphor that changed my life:**\n\nOld saying but I first read it in The Surrendered Single. A vase contains both yin (feminine) and yang (masculine) energy. The structure of the vase is yang, and the void within is yin. The void is able to receive flowers, thus giving the structure\u2019s hardness its purpose.\n\nI would have never conceptualized it like that! In graciously receiving, feminine energy gives purpose and meaning to masculine energy.\n\n**Appreciative receiving:**\n\nIn previous relationships and dating, I felt uncomfortable receiving big gifts or big help. I was subconsciously afraid that I didn\u2019t deserve it, or that if he keeps giving, he\u2019d see our relationship as unbalanced and resent me. In Men are from Mars, the author explains that appreciation is one of the primary needs of \u201cmartians\u201d and that in enthusiastically appreciating his gifts, you\u2019re actually making it easier for him to fall in love.\n\nPractice: My new boyfriend found out I make videos as a hobby, and offered to lend me his equipment. Before, I would\u2019ve said \u201cno it\u2019s ok\u201d but instead, I squealed and thanked him. He looked so happy, and he has been finding so many little ways to help me out in daily life.\n\n**Subtle receiving:**\n\nBefore RP, I enjoyed men planning dates and paying for them. I thought I was being feminine, but I completely forgot all the subtle ways of receiving. In The Surrendered Single, the author reminds us to stay relatively quiet on dates so you can receive your date\u2019s entertainment, instead of trying to entertain him yourself.\n\nThis was huge! Before, I would get men to laugh, and they seemed to have so much fun on our dates, but only maybe half of them would ask me out again. I never realized that me trying to be entertaining was not only competing with their spotlight (that they want you to admire) but also accidentally conveying low-confidence. I thought it took high-confidence to joke around and \u201cbe weird,\u201d but it took another level of self-assuredness for a girl to be comfortable with smiling and staying silent, knowing that it\u2019s the man who has to prove himself to her, not the other way around.\n\nPractice: After reading about this, I smiled at and reacted (\u201cOh wow!\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d - When I genuinely felt it) to my dates, trusting them to lead the conversation, trusting them to remain attracted to me even if I don\u2019t display my humor and intelligence right now, trusting them to ask me questions if they really want to know. It was really hard at first. I felt so scared of being boring, of being thought of as dumb. But almost everyone wanted a second date, including my now boyfriend :)\n\n**STFU: don\u2019t probe:**\n\nWhen I started dating again, my friends and parents wanted me to immediately suss out the career prospects of my dates. I intuitively knew not to do this, and to instead wait for them to reveal it themselves. But sometimes even innocent questions are not innocent to men. In Men are from Mars, the author blew my mind by saying women need caring whereas men need trust. If I share my plan for the future, I WANT people to ask me how I\u2019m going to achieve it. But a man might see excessive questions as you don\u2019t trust him to know how to get there. When I first read about this, along with the \u201cbe quiet\u201d thing, I took it overboard. At the end of one date, the man said \u201cyou haven\u2019t asked me a single question!\u201d It\u2019s sometimes hard to distinguish between a probing question and a question of genuine interest. I came up with this to help me:\n\nProbing question: evaluates his future potential, evaluates whether his plans will work out, traces the past to find trajectory\n\nCurious question: gets to know who he is right now (like what\u2019s your favorite food?)\n\nBonus question: if he\u2019s talking about a technical subject that he knows a lot about but you don\u2019t, and you\u2019re somewhat interested, ask him to explain (like how does that work?) and watch him beam!\n\nPractice: I resisted my parents\u2019 nagging and did not ask my boyfriend about his career while dating. I was enthusiastic and accepting when he revealed anything about himself, like saying \u201csounds like fun!\u201d when he said he plays video games. In no time, he naturally told me about his future career and financial plans. I didn\u2019t probe into their feasibility, I just revealed my excitement for him, because my intuition actually tells me to trust him.\n\n**STFU: Not offering help:**\n\nJust don\u2019t offer help or advice unless explicitly asked, otherwise you\u2019re sending the message that you don\u2019t fully trust him, which undermines his natural tendency to lead.\n\nPractice: He took me to a restaurant, but it was unexpectedly closed. He apologized, but of course I just smiled and shrugged. He started looking up a different place, but his phone wasn\u2019t working and he complained a bit. Well, my phone was fine, and before RP I would have said \u201clet\u2019s look it up on my phone,\u201d but now I just kept smiling, and leaned my head on his shoulder as we waited. He fixed it quickly and took me to the new place, and he was in a great mood for the rest of the night. This is a minor example but when a man complains about an obstacle, it is NOT an invitation for us to help! It\u2019s maybe subconsciously to make the obstacle seem tougher, so we can praise him even more when he overcomes it ;)\n\n*There are also a bunch of other tidbits from the books I've applied, like \"would you\" vs. \"could you\" mode of requests (asking for your needs to be met), \"girlish\" showing of anger and other negative emotions, disclosing feelings and preferences instead of logical reasoning, and had great results! I'm running out of time for now, but I'll try to write about the specifics in the comments. Thanks again to this subreddit for showing me the principles that have made such a difference in my life :)*\n\nEDIT: Formatting","title":"I applied a bunch of tips from Fascinating Womanhood and other books.

I started reading and following RPW a few months ago and around the same time moved in with my SO. The ideas surrounding feminine behavior and embracing a feminine role in your relationship really appealed to me and I have been trying to apply them in my life.\n\nThe other night I had a lovely epiphany and it may seem a little silly but stay with me! So, my SO finds he has had a hole in his favorite jeans. He looks around a bit for new ones but doesn\u2019t have much luck and we are trying to save money at the moment so he doesn\u2019t want to spend too much  \u2013 I love how responsible he is on this front :) I\u2019m sure to many of you ladies this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal but I offered to mend the hole for him. I haven\u2019t stitched in a long time and never in front of him but I remembered how and recently got a little sewing-kit to rebuild this skill. It seemed like a little thing to offer but I could not have predicted how happy he was and how content doing this little act of service for him made me. Now, I am not the world\u2019s best seamstress by any stretch but  as I was sitting beside him on the sofa stitching I just felt this contentment wash over me -  I felt so pleased and proud that I could add this special value to his life and that he so valued me for it. I also felt feminine in completing such a task and empowered by that.\n\n\nWhen he tried them on he seemed so amazed and proud and said he couldn\u2019t wait to show everyone at work \u2013 we had to laugh because he won\u2019t really be able to show anyone due to the \u201cdelicate\u201d location of the hole! But it just showed me how me doing this seemingly small thing \u2013 a thing which a few months ago I might not have even offered to do due to a misplaced fear of betraying some sort of principal of \u201cequality\u201d \u2013 both made him super happy, me super content and led to an atmosphere of laughter and lightness in our home.  It inspired me to keep working on ways in which I can develop feminine skills which are often underappreciated in mainstream culture but can bring such a lot to homes and relationships. I\u2019d love to hear how you ladies develop and use these in your homes!!

For the purpose of this question, we will assume that they do in fact exist. With that being said, if you have anectodal experience that leads you to believe that sigma males *do not in fact exist*, then I encourage you to contribute to the conversation.**\n\nNow then.\n\n**What I think I know about sigma males:**\n\nA sigma male is a male who defies placement in the social hierarchy, he is not dependent on social success and does not seek adulation. A sigma male can be characterized as being non-chalant while simultaneously being a challenger to authority.\n\nSigma males share many traits with the alpha male, but differentiate from them in that they do not want to be leaders, and they do not really care for power structures in general. A sigma male will gladly dethrone an alpha in a social setting if it suits their goals, or if they find the leadership of that alpha to be substandard.\n\nFrom my experience, smart alphas have no problem with sigma males, and often leave them alone, as is the best option.\n\nA sigma male is unconventional, clever, and has that \"extra something\". Sigmas enjoy their alone time and are commonly introverts, but this doesn't mean they lack social skills, just that they like to flex them less than an alpha male would.\n\nI have also read that sigma males are males that would have otherwise become an alpha male, but they experienced some kind of heavy trauma in their lives and this knocked them heavily off track.\n\nDon't take my word for it? *Good*. You should do your own research about it. That's what I did, and that's how I know about this. Apparently there is something about it stickied on r\/trp..\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nHave you met a sigma male in your life? Did you get to know them pretty well?

My husband is 38. He moved out about 3 weeks ago, we haven't talked much since. We have a 5yo daughter, 3yo son. Both of us work full time, we both earn good salaries but not loads. He earns very slightly more but our salaries are similar. All my life I would have described myself as a feminist however I am now starting to question this. Since we've had children, we have had not a very happy relationship. He is very lazy when he is home and just wants to sit and watch tv rather than do stuff with the kids or do housework. Whenever I get him to do stuff he always complains and we often have fights and it wasn't going very well. He says I never thank him when he does do anything and I said it is his house, he is equally responsible for keeping it clean as I am and that I would thank him if and when he fully pulled his weight. However before kids our relationship was great and I am still convinced deep down he is a good man. I discovered that he was having an affair with a 21yo (the age gap still makes me cringe) who has now broken up with him. This is what ultimately caused him moving out. I asked him what made him want to cheat on me and what made him not be happy and he said that she 'made him feel like a man'. At the time this made me livid and I had a massive go at him about how he shouldn't need me to make him feel like a man and that a proper man wouldn't cheat and would pull his weight around the house. However over the past 2 weeks I have reconsidered everything! I have thought a lot about how great he was before kids and how I still thought he was a good man. It made me reconsider if what I did, how I acted and what I expected of him was right. I've felt bad for quite a while about going back to work, I do care about my kids loads more than work and I felt really bad about that but I told myself that I wanted to go back to work to be an example of a strong independant woman for my daughter. However I reconsidered this and am doubting whether I should have been valuing my career so highly. I did some googling and came across your community! To start with ngl I thought you were all forced into this and indoctrinated into think this, but the more I read of your posts the more I realised most of you were very happy and the more I began to doubt my life choices and question that this is maybe what will be best. I am convinced my husband is a good man and that is what makes me question all this most. Also I really do want to try and fix our marriage, I don't want to divorce as I know it'll be tough to find someone else and also will be terrible for the kids! However part of me is just so embarrassed at even considering this and I feel too embarrassed to tell any of my friends, I made a new reddit so they won't see hence why I have no previous posts! Just want to get a bit more information about this cause I am so on the fence and doubting everything and also feel embarrassed to talk to anyone so I haven't told anyone at all I am doubting everything!

Its scary to feel it in your body and soul to want something that is so natural yet be told that its something that you should not want. My father is turning 60 next month and he tells me that I have so much time to have a family. Yet my grandparents died when I was 10 and my father had grandparents till he was quite old. I want my parents to be grandparents, I want my children to have grandparents. I don't want to wait, I want what I want and I will do it right but its super sad to know that this is something that requires other people to want too. Its not just up to me to have a happy little family whenever I want it. I am just having faith, being honest with myself\/others, planning responsibly and I hope it will all happen when\/if it's suppose to.   \n\n\nxoxoxo","title":"What is it like to have children?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/fe3faf\/what_is_it_like_to_have_children\/"}

But her words have stayed with me and I wanted to bring you all my thoughts. \n\nLost the Desire to Serve. Can you hear the ripples of gasps among empowered modern women? *Serve?* \n\nYes. \n\nThese words came to me at a time much needed. Though I pride myself on being a woman of service, a nurse-by-night and homemaker-by-day, I have found myself becoming, regrettably, service-spent. I came home a few days ago in the morning to find the few things undone I had asked Q to do before going to sleep, trash he had left by the couch, food left on the counter, and a pile of recycling climbing up the wall. I had spent all night serving patients, families, and coworkers, and ended up coming home exhausted, and scrubbing the dishes with seeds of unfamiliar resentment. Can\u2019t I get any help around here? Is it so hard to put one Tupperware in the dish washer? I made him his usual breakfast and lunch, and got ready for bed in a huff. I climbed into bed and in the sweetest style possible I told him I wanted to have an argument but that I would apologize straight away. I asked why he couldn\u2019t do just the few little things I asked of him and that I really needed some help around here to keep up. I plan to be a stay at home mom eventually, but while I\u2019m still working, I felt it was no fair to do everything around the house too. He was so sweet, held me and kissed me and apologized, and told me he would be better. I didn't sleep well and woke up feeling guilty. \n\nI have decided that it\u2019s me who needs to be better. Of course there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for help, and I\u2019m glad I did, but I had totally forgotten in that moment everything I stand for as a traditional woman, a woman of service. A woman who *desires to serve.* A woman who derives *contentment* from dedicating her time and heart and hands to the service of others, especially her man. But already, at nearly the beginning of my journey, I have witnessed how easily I might slip and falter. So I have decided to commit myself to Mindfulness in Service, a mental focus to mindfully and consciously reset daily, reminding myself of who I want to be and what energy I want to bring to the world, and to my home. Why I serve. \n\nI don\u2019t know what that might look like for you, it might be a daily prayer, it might be a sticky note on your desk, it might be meditation, or maybe you have been practicing long enough it comes more naturally. But the goal for me is no longer merely to serve, but to *desire to serve.*\n\nI have everything I could ask for - a kind and generous and hardworking man of steadfast morals and convictions, an incredible mind, who is patient, appreciative, thoughtful, and dedicated to building this life with me. Why on earth did it matter to me where he put a tupperware? I\u2019m proud to say I woke up this afternoon early enough to accomplish a few power hours of delightful service, thoroughly cleaning the house including several things I\u2019ve been meaning to do for weeks (doesn\u2019t that feel so good!), making dinner, running errands for Q, and putting together a gift for him I\u2019ve been meaning to finish. Yes, I even took out the recycling, and yes, I truly and genuinely enjoyed doing it. \n\nLet me know if you ever need a reset button, and maybe for some of you, this can be it. If you have any other tips for Mindful Service, please let me know! It\u2019s so lovely to be on this journey with all of you.","title":"Mindfulness in Service","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/d79824\/mindfulness_in_service\/"}

Being that this topic comes up every now and then, I'm posting it as a post*\n\nTRP is a discussion on male and female nature. It isn't an ideology or religion. Therefore, RP men are just men who are more honest about male nature, but there is no difference between the male nature of an RP man or any other man.\n\nRegarding the question itself - feminism brainwashed men to believe that N-count doesn't matter. They did a good job at this brainwashing. However, human nature will always prevail sooner or later and human male nature is to have less and less desire for a woman as her N-count rises. Eventually, this lack of desire will turn to outright disgust.\n\nLet's take extreme examples to drive home the point.\n\nExample one - a smoking hot, 10\/10 bombshell beauty had sex with a thousand men. Now she wants to get married. How many men will want to marry her? Very few. There will still be men who'd line up to have sex with her but after a thousand men, that line will be much shorter despite her being a bombshell beauty. Why?\n\nBecause women are the gatekeepers of sex. Sex is the main thing that men need from women. Therefore, it's the prime value that a woman has. Each time she gives this value to a man, her value is diminished.\n\nAnother angle to this - women are human beings. Therefore, her highest value is when her \"being\" is in its most pristine state. Because her highest value to men is her sexual value, she's most sexually valuable when she's in her sexually pristine state.\n\nA woman who had only 3 sexual partners may still have enough value (sexual and otherwise) to compensate for her drop in sexual value due to her sexual past. However, this doesn't mean that past sex is meaningless.\n\nExample two - a chiseled, ripped band player travels from town to town doing music. At every concert he goes to, there's a lineup of groupies trying to fuck him backstage. Let's say he has sex with 5 girls a week, that's 50 girls in 10 weeks and 250 girls in 50 weeks. If he's an attractive and successful musician, it's very easy for him to pull this off.\n\nIf he does this for 4 years, he'd have fucked over a thousand woman easily!!! Yet, groupies will still clamor to fuck him backstage. Why? Because he's a man of high sexual value and this value is unaffected by his high N-count. It doesn't matter if he ducks ten thousand women, he isn't valuable for his sex, therefore, having more sex doesn't affect his value.\n\nOTOH, a man who falls in love and gets friendzoned time and time again - this man will have his value drop with each time he's friendzoned. Each time just makes him more of a loser.\n\nNo man wants to see himself as a loser for giving his heart to a dozen women only to have them put it through the meat grinder. No woman wants to see herself as someone of lesser value just because she got pumped and dumped a few times. But neither of these desires changes the fact that this indeed lowers ones sexual value in the eyes of the other sex.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nHuman nature is what it is and doesn't care about your feelings or whether you think it's fair. Fact is that N-count lowers a woman's sexual value just like the friendzone lowers a man's sexual value. There's a reason societies of old married virgins... \n\nCheers!

So I'm newish to RPW and I've been upping my girl game, confidence, and feminine zest for life following a dark stint subscribing to the feminist church in college.\n\nI have posted here previously regarding a  sigma\/introverted man I've been seeing for a year now (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/55p63f\/he_has_given_me_a_conditional_offer_to_move_me_to\/). Just to recap, I lost his trust\/attraction during the tail end of my SJW days and I fell into a depression related to my paranoid world views and lost sight of myself\/life goals. Understandably he had little interest in a relationship with me earlier this year and expressed he didn't want to be my boyfriend and was skeptical of me. We still kept in touch\/slept together and during this time I did a complete 180 and took the red pill. \n\nIt really wasn't easy and I went through a depression phase. The \"empowerment\" that feminism claimed to offer me turned me into a reactionary, paranoid, and clingy woman. The way I viewed men was not out of respect and understanding, but out of fear. Feminism taught me that ambiguous forces such as the patriarchy and male privilege influenced men consciously and subconsciously. This supposedly leads to toxic expressions of masculinity, which can manifest in all sorts of ways. Long story short, I was seeing malicious intentions in the men around me that just were not there. While I never had a combative personality, I was needlessly avoidant of men and vetting them incorrectly.\n\nI'm in such a great position today and I owe much of it to finding my inner grace as a woman and respecting the contrasting imperatives\/goals that men have. With my (now) boyfriend in particular, it was just a matter of allowing myself to fall in his frame and adding worth to his life outside sex.\n\nYou guys weighed in on the situation and I'm happy to say that I've earned a chance with the man of my dreams. Upon him offering conditional LTR\/girlfriend status based on my own self improvement, I was confused about if it was a good idea to continue seeing this guy, but things seem to be heading in the right direction since I've decided to continue giving the relationship a shot.\n\nHe recently brought me to his brother's fiance's bridal shower, which was a great opportunity for me to make a good impression with the other ladies in his family and meet family members and family friends. He told me it was a rare occurrence that his whole family got together like that, so I felt really special that he trusted me to represent him in that situation. His aunt told him that I was really sweet and he seemed pleased by my manners around his family. I might be spending Christmas with his family now. Yay!\n\nI only get to see him once a week or so since he goes to college an hour away from me, but I really try to make his visits worth it. I've been dolling up in dresses when I see him (he always comments that I look cute!), give him massages,  let him relax after a hard week, giggle with him, buy him his favorite snacks, talk about our shared hobby (trading card games) etc. All those little things add up!\n\nI'm having the best sex of my life. Last time he visited we went at it three times in one night. He really opened up to me during sex. He wanted to look deep into my eyes and talk to me. I told him I wanted to be good to him so much and I didn't want any other guy to touch me or have me. I told him he's the man in my heart. He said \"I know. You are so good to me. That's why I want to have sex with only you. I love you more than anyone. I hope you can feel that.\"\n\nHe then told me that he loves our sex and that it means something. He told me I am special and when I told him I wanted to be with him he said I was with him. God it was so hot and afterwards he held me tight in his arms and whispered in my ear that he loves me and we fell asleep sweaty and happy. This is some top tier mythic romance novel level stuff. I've been swooning for days.\n\nHe's been sending me more \"I miss you\" texts. I just let him initiate conversation and give him space when he needs to focus on school. He has another semester left after this one before he is ejected into the \"real world\" and starts the amazing IT job he's been offered. No more stage five clinger behaviour! Of course having a job and a couple of new projects in my life helps keep me occupied and content. I've been helping a coworker out with her vintage clothing shop on Etsy and I've been taking a introductory web design class and kicking butt at that. Of course I'm watching my calorie intake and doing leg lifts\/crunches. I'm already at a healthy weight, but I'm looking to tone the booty and legs.\n\nMy end goal is probably what most of you want. I want to make a home with a life partner. Marriage would probably be a part of that. I can definitely see myself with my boyfriend for life and I feel like I'd be the happiest girl alive to stand by him every day. I hope to continue on being a phenomenal girlfriend and respect myself as well. \n\nThanks ladies!","title":"Taking the red pill is resulting in the LTR of my dreams.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5ccti4\/taking_the_red_pill_is_resulting_in_the_ltr_of_my\/"}

It's probably almost no surprise to any of you that \"most men prefer younger women around 20-25\" according to TRP. But is this a preference for fun sex? Or marriage? Or both lol?\n\nMany men have a mating strategy that is what I like to call the \"smash and dash.\" Younger women are more vulnerable to this as they have less life experience. Often, in TRP I see comments such as \"my cute girlfriend is 23\" or \"I don't date women in their 30s..\" BUT I don't see comments talking about MARRYING these younger women.. it's just sex and girlfriends. I like to think the goal of RPW is marriage and forever commitment NOT being temporary fun for a man.\n\nNow I know TRP isn't a huge marriage-minded sub lol and I would never be interested in a \"red pill woke\" man myself BUT I do notice quite a few of the men on the sub are married or have an ex wife and they are NOT the sexy little 23 year olds they love to talk about all the time.\n\nMen on this sub feel free to comment.

I barely qualify as a member of the community ;p I merely want to offer up my thinking and my perspective so that other people who are trying to make up their mind about RPW can hear from someone who maybe isn't who they'd expect to find. \n\n\n\n**ABOUT ME (the political stuff)**: I'm as blue state as they come. I campaign passionately for progressive causes, especially those that pertain to equal access to opportunity for women. I truly do not mean to break community rules and say anything negative about TRP so suffice to say I agree with very, very little of that subreddit's content. \n\nI have an intense career about which I am very passionate. I hope to change the world for the better in a big way. I never planned to live a life characterized by \"traditional 50's gender roles\". I live what I hope is an independent, adventurous, big, worldly life. \n\n\n**SO WHY RPW? **\n\n\n**1)** RPW is not as prescriptive as I thought. \n\nI don't want to dive into the entomological debate around \"what a community\" is defined by. But there are plenty of women who contribute to RPW who are not SAHM, who don't live \"super traditional\" lives. To me, RPW is not an ideology that seeks to dictate its members' choices. Or at least, I've never felt any pushback because I live the way I do. \n\n**2)** I want an all-female space where I can celebrate the feminine.\n\n\nRPW is a place where I can celebrate my femininity and fully relax and be my girl-iest self. There aren't a lot of other communities for me where that's the case. Girlishness is usually seen as ditziness, shallowness. I love my feminist spaces too but it's hard to gush about your BF without being seen as boring, lame, unintellectual. I brood a lot on the phrase \"a servant's heart.\" That's an ideal that transcends femininity and masculinity but has a particular relationship with the feminine, and it's one I consciously want to cultivate. I seek to be nurturing, un-egotistical, supportive, to want to **serve** my darling life partner. Not all men, not men in general, not \"men\" the political idea...my man.\n\n**3)** I want a space where I can celebrate the domestic.\n\n\nSimilarly, I love being in a space where we can celebrate and honor the little things - a well-cooked meal shared with the people you love, decorating a house to make it a home, choosing some gentle words carefully to soothe a spouse. Workaholic or not these little domestic moments make up **so much of our lives**... and so much of the time we share with our families. I love that this community takes them seriously, honors this kind of work properly, acknowledges its importance. \n\nWhen you think of cleaning as a chore you hope your boyfriend does for you...that's what it is. An opportunity to fight, to complain, to be exhausted. When you think of cleaning as a political moment....that's what it is. A chance to stand on a soapbox (don't get me wrong, I love soapboxes haha). \n\nBut being part of RPW makes me think of these little things --tidying up our closet, doing the dishes--as a chance to embody love, devotion, a chance to enact higher principles. That kind of thinking makes those moments beautiful. And that makes my whole life more beautiful. \n\n\n\n**4)** I want a space where we can acknowledge painfully realistic things without being accused of being sexist or offensive.\n\n\n\nI think people hear terms like \"the wall\" or \"dread game\" they assume they're *moral* statements or *instructions*. I see them as observations. To me, RPW isn't about *instructing* people to not date older women who are \"past the wall\", it isn't about *instructing* women or men to employ \"dread game.\" FOR ME, TRP is about merely recognizing that it is harder to date past a certain age, that psychologically that adjustment can be dangerous (for instance).

This isn't completely your fault.  Studies show that both men and women employ two main mating strategies, those being monogamous and promiscuous, or restricted and unrestricted, as explained here in this handy wiki on sociosexual orientation: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sociosexual_orientation. This means that women  on the end of the unrestricted spectrum are more likely to continuously seek out multiple partners in order to have the chance of reproducing with the best mate. Women like this see benefits in short-term mating. If you're a woman towards this end of the spectrum, then you're naturally hypergamous.\n\nFurthermore, over time, it is natural for women's sexual desire to decrease in an LTR, as demonstrated here: https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/the-power-pleasure\/201204\/does-desire-really-decrease-length-relationship\n\nDoes this mean that it's impossible for naturally hypergamous women to have happy, healthy committed relationships with their captains? Of course not! You have free will. It will just be a little more work to fight your natural mating instincts than for women not so evolutionarily inclined to the carousel. Here are some tips on stopping the hypergamous instincts from jump-starting your hamster, and jeopardizing your long-term happiness.\n\n1. Cut yourself a little slack:  If you're a RPW you've been cultivating a more feminine persona both physically and socially, and your growth probably hasn't gone unnoticed. It's OKAY to feel a confidence boost when you notice high-value men noticing you. You've worked for it.\n\n2. Like all good things, slack is best in moderation. While it is acceptable to appreciate this confidence boost, it is NOT OKAY to be actively seeking validation from men other than your captain to give you that confidence boost. There's a fine line between an inner smile, and an errant daydream when you sense someone flirting with you, and engaging them, giving out signals that you are available, and escalating the interaction. You know yourself and your tendencies. You know the difference. Do not lie to yourself.\n\n3. Stop the hamster, before it starts. The way to stop the hamster is to appreciate your Captain when you feel your roaming eye act up. As a RPW you probably had good reasons to choose your captain. He's been vetted for traits you admire and that make you happy. What are these traits? List them to yourself and consider if they're worth losing over the temporary tingles you get from a superficial interaction.\n\n4. Are the pastures really greener on the other side, or are you just not watering the lawn? A happy relationship takes the work of two, but you're only in control of yourself. If things aren't so great lately, ask yourself how are you contributing to the relationship to help your captain lead? Think of actions that would make your captain happy, not solipsistic actions that would satisfy you because you're not dating you! Consider ways that you can be generous towards his desires (I highly recommend The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands by Laura Schlessinger. It's a bit simplistic and overly-religious, but it boils down to core issues for keeping a happy home.) This way your captain can easily take the lead and continuously provide you the tingles you seek from other men.\n\n5. How would you feel if the tables were turned? Don't let the hamster run amok and try to justify flirting with other men. Imagine if your captain was the one being flirted with by other women. If you're like me, you'd be somewhat proud that other women notice him, as it corroborates his high-value, but very grateful that he stays loyal to you. And if he doesn't? If he engages these women in flirtatious behavior and escalates his involvement with them, how would you feel? Would you feel disrespected, and even betrayed? If so, why would you inflict those emotions upon a captain you chose and profess to care about? You're better than this. Don't forget that. That's what brought you to RPW, and what keeps you here.\n\n6. Non-negotiable signs that it really isn't you, it's your captain. There are a few instances in which you really can do better for yourself than your current captain. These include if your captain is cruel, has addictions, cheats, is entirely unambitious and unmotivated to any form of self growth, (this is not strictly financial,) is uncommitted to a future with you, or disagrees with your future thoughts on having a family. If any of these apply to your relationship, the answer is still not flirting with other men while you're committed. What you need to do is grow some ovaries, cut your losses, take what's left of your SMV and RMV, possibly nun mode until you've healed, and then put yourself back on the market. (I highly recommend an interval of nun moding, because as insensitive as it may sound, baggage isn't cute. The type of man you're looking for wants to be your captain, not your bellboy. It's good to make sure your hurt emotions from your past relationship are firmly in storage before you proceed to vet a new captain.) This way you can find a new captain who both gives you tingles and meets your requirements for a mate. \n\nIn closing, what differentiates us from animals is that as humans we have the ability to outsmart nature and bend it to our will. As a conscious and conscientous woman you have the power to be better than your instincts.  While your thoughts may occasionally betray you, your choices define your character. Choose to be a good woman. I'm rooting for you.","title":"Tips for the Hypergamous Woman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/58ow5i\/tips_for_the_hypergamous_woman\/"}

He said it in those exact words. I mean yes sexual assault and rape is bad, but I disagree that it's worse than murder. Also he agrees with everything any feminist article or person says seemingly without even thinking about it. \n\nMany more of these guys are all about \"you can't objectify women ever\" or tell them \"anything is impossible or they can't do anything (even if they really can't cuz of lack of talent etc.)\n\n\nAnyway I am very attractive to the guy who's dominant and in control--but not controlling if you see the difference, and not abusive of course.

This week, we're focusing on our sister subreddit, RedPillWives (RPWi), and exploring their wiki.\n\nPlease note, we are not the original authors of these posts. We'll be offering our insights as both moderators and active community members. Our objective is to provide you with a curated guide that can serve as a cornerstone to understanding RPW principles, while revitalizing some enduring ideas.\n\nOne of the questions that regularly gets asked on RPW is, \"What is Femininity?\" Camille answers this question with her write up and wiki post ['Psychological Femininity'](https:\/\/theredarchive.com\/r\/RedPillWives\/psychological-femininity.210103).\n\n***\n\n***\n\n*I am reposting something I submitted over a year ago under the title \u201cRPW 101: Cultivating A Feminine Frame Of Mind\u201d. It was originally going to be part of a series that explored core Red Pill concepts. Unfortunately life got in the way and I was unable to execute the series in the way that I wanted. I\u2019m so glad to share this updated version with the community, and in the future it can be found in the Essential Posts section of the wiki (which has a collection of the best RPWives content submitted to date!).*\n\n***\n\n# Psychological Femininity\n\nFeminism has permeated mainstream society to the point where myths of equality, empowerment and entitlement shape even the self-improvement resources available to women. Rarely are women encouraged to embrace their nature; androgynous appearance and masculine behaviours are perpetuated as ideal for all. This is an enormous disadvantage to women who don\u2019t have positive female role models in their lives because once discovering the truth about gender differences, there are very few places where women can receive legitimate advice regarding self-improvement.\n\nWhile there are an overwhelming amount of websites that provide information on makeup, fashion, flirting and other elements of girl game, there is a noticeable lack of quality materials that focus on the most important factor when it comes to attracting and gaining commitment from high quality men: psychological femininity. Developing this trait is a critical first step on the road to permanent change. It makes you pleasant to be around, and creates harmony in romantic relationships as men can effortlessly assume their natural role. Once this foundation is laid, it will be easier to identify areas to improve in your own life and begin the process of adopting new habits and traits.\n\n***\n\nBefore delving in to the characteristics that make one feminine, it is important to dispel some false definitions that are popular today.\n\n* **Femininity is not a weakness.** It is also not a failed or incomplete\/watered down version of masculinity. To put it simply, men and women are different. Each gender has positives, negatives, roles, and responsibilities that complement the other beautifully. When these innate distinctions are embraced, both men and women are happier and more successful, going even further in life than they would have otherwise.\n* **Femininity has nothing to do with being a doormat.** Submission within your relationship is not equivalent to being walked over or mistreated. It means trusting your man to lead, deferring to his decisions and supporting him in the way he needs. It means being less aggressive, combative, snarky, and sour. Outside of a relationship, being feminine isn\u2019t the same as letting everyone do whatever they want, simply because you\u2019re a girl. Striking a balance between politeness, respect and assertiveness is key in everyday interactions.\n* **Femininity is not acting ditzy or dumb.** You do not have to act less capable than you are to be feminine. [Men are not sexually attracted to intelligence](http:\/\/www.therulesrevisited.com\/2013\/01\/what-men-think-about-your-intelligence.html), and are put off by argumentative know-it-alls, but this does not mean that you have to limit yourself if you are an intellectual. The way you express yourself: tone, facial expression, vocabulary, etc. is extremely important. These determine how others will receive you.\n* **Femininity is not dressing up or being \u201cgirly\u201d.** A lot of women seem to think that altering their wardrobe, makeup or hair is sufficient when it comes to making changes. But no amount of skirts, blush or bows will make you feminine if you lack the disposition. Femininity is expressed through appearance but appearance is not the source of femininity. If you haven\u2019t internalised the concepts, you are merely playing dress up. There are no shortcuts.\n\n***\n\nNow, how does a psychologically feminine woman *actually* behave inside her relationship? She is:\n\n* **Yielding.** To yield is to submit, defer, and\/or relinquish oneself to a higher power. Too often women vie for dominance within a relationship, stirring up drama instead of simply allowing their man to lead. \u201cAllowing\u201d does not mean giving the man permission to lead, it means stepping out of the way so that he can step up. How to be more yielding? Say yes more. Be flexible and generous. Let go of the need to control everything.\n* **Receptive.** A receptive woman is open, interested and responsive to new ideas or suggestions. Some tips on cultivating this trait: don\u2019t immediately shoot down his statements or insist that your way is always the best way. Create situations where he can share something he enjoys with you. Keep in mind that you don\u2019t know everything -- humility is key.\n* **Supportive.** Within romantic relationships it is often necessary to provide sympathy, reassurance, information or help. On a daily basis you should be offering positive encouragement, listening more than you speak, and building him up with your words. Let your love motivate you to assist, surprise, and satisfy him regularly. Don\u2019t keep score of who is doing what for whom, simply focus on the ways you can enhance his life.\n* **Pleasant.** The most enchanting women are socially adept, agreeable, and enjoyable. Everyone, especially high value men, would rather spend time with a friendly and happy woman over someone who is mean or dull. If you want to light up a room simply laugh and smile, easily and often. Make sure your body language is open (hands facing outward, no crossing arms, no frowning, no hunching, etc.). Tell jokes; don\u2019t take everything so seriously. Speak highly of your SO both in his presence and when he isn\u2019t there. And most importantly, don\u2019t whine or complain; entitlement is not attractive.\n* **Empathetic.** The concept of directly identifying with another\u2019s emotions, situation and motives is extremely important. Female solipsism is very real and it can prevent harmony within relationships when a woman refuses to consider other perspectives than her own. To combat this, consciously seek to understand where your SO is coming from. Consider how he would want you to respond, act, or treat him in a situation, instead of assuming or projecting. Be compassionate and a source of comfort, but pay attention and give him space when he needs it.\n* **Poised.** This quality is harder to nail down but it is the end result of psychological femininity. A sense of composure, dignity, grace, and self-assurance radiates from the woman who embraces the positive aspects of her nature. Remember that your choices affect how your SO is perceived, so always carry yourself with purpose and distinction. This means proper posture, presenting yourself well, speaking clearly and in a light tone, and not chattering aimlessly.\n\nAuthentic transformation can only occur if you legitimately want to improve, and put in the requisite effort. Take the time to develop your character and acquire new traits. Don\u2019t get frustrated if it is more difficult than you anticipated, and don\u2019t get conceited if you see the results that you want quickly.\n\nThe best way to attract someone of high value is to become someone of high value. This all starts with cultivating a feminine frame of mind, but self-improvement is a lifelong journey.","title":"Back To Basics September: Psychological Femininity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1672w0f\/back_to_basics_september_psychological_femininity\/"}

I agreed and said something akin to, \"yes and women are the ones mostly raising boys, who are brought up to be emotionless and then these boys grow up and lack emotional intelligence, unlike girls who are trained to be in tune with their feelings and not called sissies for it.\" that post disappeared. Then in response to something that someone else, \"90% of crimes would disappear if men were disappeared\/banned\/obselete (cant remember the word but along these lines)\" and I said, VER BATIM, this attitude is extreme.

So here it is, and I hope it's beneficial to you all. \n\nSo, a little while after I made that post, my boyfriend and I were driving somewhere and he started talking to me about his idea for the \"intro\" to their set (he was going to record the sound of the rain and all the spooky \"night sounds\" in the woods near our house), and I casually mentioned that I hoped the concert would be recorded, because I'd like to see how that would turn out on stage. I think this was his lightbulb moment of \"oh shit, I'm excluding my girlfriend from something she's actually interested in.\" At this point, the practice sessions with his band were going well, he was less stressed about his own performance with the guitar\/vocals, and the pressure of not having performed in so long\/being out of practice was subsiding. Basically, he was able to think a bit more calmly about the situation -- instead of seeing me as another added stressor, he was seeing me as someone who loved him and would support him throughout the weekend. \n\nIn a matter of a couple days after that comment, he went from, \"well, I mean, yeah you can come actually...\" to \"you're coming with me, I'm getting you in for free, you're eating with the rest of the musicians, and I've talked to the organizer about having you stay overnight to sleep with the rest of us.\"\n\nThe concert was this weekend. He was, of course, a bit stressed, but not at all as much as he had been before. Being as the show was in a city a few hours away, and it was a pretty big event (pretty much an all-day thing), we left in the morning with one of his bandmates, and spent the weekend in a *very* scenic coastal city. The things he was stressed about (having to \"take care\" of me while they were doing sound check\/throughout the day) ended up being non-issues. During soundcheck I explored the city a bit on my own, and there were enough events going on throughout the day, before the concert, to keep both of us busy. \n\nThe concert itself was spectacular. I won't go into a ton of detail about it, but they performed amazingly well, and I was incredibly happy to have been there, and immensely proud of my boyfriend. \n\nThroughout the day and the evening, he was incredibly sweet (as always), we supported each other the way a couple should, and had a really fantastic time. To top it all off, the next day, before leaving to come back home, we ended up visiting the ocean at low tide and walking all along the beach. It was incredibly scenic and an amazing experience. \n\nHere's what I learned from this event:\n\nSometimes, when men are stressed or anxious, they see everything as a problem to be solved, and will start trying to avert crises before they happen. \n\nI also learned that I need to just chill out and *trust him*! It's not surprising that he reacted in a negative way during a time of stress, because he was in a mode of trying to put out a bunch of fires at once (I later learned, for example, that his bassist had been slacking and hadn't learned all the songs at the time I made the original post -- obviously another stressor).\n\nIf there's anything you all take away from this update, it's that not everything is a big red flag, and your boyfriend not wanting to include you in something doesn't always mean he's got something to hide. Sometimes it means he wants alone time\/time with the boys. Sometimes it just means he's stressed and needs time to process things clearly. I know some commenters were mentioning he was hoping to exclude me in order to get some groupie tail. Firstly, I know him well enough to know this isn't the case, and would never be the case. Secondly, let me close off by mentioning what he said to  me to close off the night -- \n\n\"\/u\/KittenLoves_, you were by far the hottest girl there tonight.\" Damn right -- why cheat on perfection? ;)","title":"(UPDATE) \"My hamster is spinning out of control -- someone smack some sense into me\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9eoknk\/update_my_hamster_is_spinning_out_of_control\/"}

I believe this is a decent guide for new Rpwomen also. If your do not understand a word click on it and it's going to explain the term for you via urban dictionary. Also, non-native english speaker but I am trying:).*\n\n**Summary:** you can improve\/skyrocket your [SMV](http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=SMV) outside your appearance, by observing qualities that lack in the general female population and aquiring them. \n\n**Introduction:** I read \/r\/TheRedPill on a daily basis and most men complain about the quality of 21st century women. Indoctrinated by feminism and mostly clueless about their role and biological engineering, today's women seem to embody \"qualities\" that men try avoiding at all cost. Let's see what men complain about:\n\n* **Fat** - women today are getting fatter because it's not pollitically correct to promote eating less (it also damages economy. people must consume. a lot. ). Fat women artificially increase the SMV of thinner women and inflate their ego. \n\n* **Confrontational** - women are taught to put men (and other women) in their place and never let men step on their pride. This leads to a defensive and aggressive demeanor, which is off-putting  & replaces feminine demeanor. \n\n* **Slutty** - this is a very easy one. RP women are aware of the [CC](http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=cock+carousel&defid=7263482) and it's limited tickets (to nowhere). Most women are not aware. They believe casual sex is \"so cool\" and by sleeping with a lot of men they see it as a \"revenge\" on the opposite gender. *\"You're using me for your pleasure? I'm using you, baby boy! Come here and show me what you're made of\"* thinks the empowered woman. That is NOT attractive. \n\n* **Career-crazy** - If you're fat\/slutty\/confrontational or all of the above, it's no wonder your personal life is a mess. Your standards are high and your SMV low, so career becomes your main focus. You try filling the void by making career a priority thinking it's going to make you a successful woman\n\n* **Entitled** - this is the main one I observed. Because we are born in a feminist climate, we are born entitled to EVERYTHING. I want to be equal to men, but pls open the door for me. I am very strong and independent, but I don't split the bill. I am a career woman, but I must conceive (biological clock) so let me engage in casual sex maybe somebody will commit. I deserve commitment even though I am not offering anything in return. Entitled to everything, the 21st century woman demands...demands...demands. \n\n\n**Body**: As RP Women we are aware how much of our value is based on appearance. Well, as long as you do everything in your power to look good, you're good. Maybe even with your efforts you don't feel competitive enough in the Social\/Sexaul Marketplace. It doesn't matter, because there are some VERY important qualities which are in HIGH demand. Acquiring these qualities will skyrocket your SMV. **Beauty is rarity. There's no lack of beautiful women but there's a lack of feminine qualities and using this information wisely will make you extremely valuable, an asset to every quality man and to society.**\n\n* **Thin** - This guide is not about appearance but I feel this needs to be said: Get thin the RP way! Men feel like we need to put so little work (compared to them) to look good. They must count calories, macros, lift, be disciplined, be long-term oriented. All we have to do to look good is eat less (or count calories). **That's it.**\n\n* **Non - confrontational** - this is so rare these days. I feel like all women are just waiting to engage in a verbal-fight at any moment. This may not be true, but the tone in their voice, the lack of kindness in their words is an indicator to that. \nIf your tone is  aggressive, make it honey-sweet. It works like a charm. I used to be a crazy\/psycho aggressive girl when I was a teenager but your tone\/attitude can be changed with practice. A girl watched too much [Bad Girls Club](http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=Bad+Girls+Club&defid=5778742) and wants to put you in your place? Don't step to that low-level behaviour. You are going to meet a lot of people who deserve to be put in their place, who are going to try stepping on you and so on. The trick is to CONTROL your impulses and not act on them. The prize will be so much better than letting off steam in the heat of the moment. Think royalty. Think of a high-status lady and how she would never engage in confrontational behavior. That's what you should be aiming for. **Because true ladies are very rare these days, this kind of  demeanour is very appreciated by men and will make them respect you and value you.**\n\n* **Prude** - If your partner count is low and you never engaged in casual sex, this is not a problem for you. But sluttiness comes from more than a high partner count. It comes from the appearance of \"availability\" and \"easiness\". You can look easy by dressing trashy and drinking alcohol like a man. Swearing, shouting and attention-\nseeking are also classic components of slutty behavior. Needless to say: DON'T DO THAT. Your aim should be to look pure and inocent - this means never engage in sexual conversations outside of your relationship *(Note: My boyfriend pointed out to me how his coworker (f) started a discussion about condoms as a sexual strategy to get in his pants)* , never be sexually-suggestive and don't showcase a dirty mind. **These are for your bedroom only**, and you know that. You'll stand out in the crowd like the most beautiful gem. \n\n* **Financially stable** - As a RPwoman you should aim for financial stability and a field of work which you are passionate about. A RPwoman is smart and knows that providing for yourself is an intelligent move, but she keeps balance. I read \/r\/RedPillWomen\/ and I see a lot of discussions about how you should balance career & personal life and this subreddit is a great resource for information. Keep in mind: **If you are impressed with a man's career achievements this does NOT means he is going to be impressed \nwith yours**. It does not work like that, so never use career in your sexual strategy. \n\n* **Modest** - You are not entitled to anything. I quote from TRP \"Your purpose on this planet is to reproduce. You are NOT entitled to happiness, you do not deserve this or that. Be prepared to work for it but don't expect it or feel entitled to it\". I completly agree with this view. Don't inflate your ego. Set your boundaries and your\nmoral code and follow it. If a man does not provide you with what you feel you need, just leave. Do not make scenes about how you deserve this and that, do not expect him to love you and provide for you. Just keep working, improving yourself and be rational. TRP suggest women should lower standards, but I do not really agree with \nthis. We (RPwomen) are a valuable asset to society by understanding our weaknesses and strengths. You should never lower standards as a Redpill woman as long as you are willing to WORK at your SMV. Realize you are not entitled to anything, but you are willing to WORK for everything. \n\n\n**A few mentions and tips:**\n \n- On TRP a very common commentary is *\"A man will see a mountain and try climbing to the top. A woman sees a mountain and declares that the top is where she is\".*An examples is the fat acceptance movement. Instead of working to be fit and beautiful, women declare their current look (fat, overweight, rolls) attractive. Is it attractive? It does NOT matter! THEY SAY SO! Don't be like that (I'm sure you aren't), just be willing to accept your flaws and improve.\n\n- Keep your mental problems in check. No matter what tumblr says depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis etc ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE, romantic or intriguing. Present yourself as a perfectly sane person.\n \n- Don't drink, don't do drugs! Personally I do not consume alcohol at all, but I suppose drinking a glass of wine will not compromise your lady-like image. Men loathe women who engage in drugs and binge drinking. This is simply too common, trashy and low-value. Just don't...\n\n- Never be too radical in your views. Even if you own enough knowledge on a subject and a solid, strong opinion, the smart way is to keep it to yourself or share it with a pretty pretty... pretty  package. Tone it down. I used to be so radical in my (political) views and I looked like a complete psycho. I am very passionate about a lot of things and so are you, but let's not let our views spoil a good climate and ruin our feminine frame. \n\n**Conclusion:** Observe the marketplace and identify what it's lacking. Acquire qualities that other women seem to be oblivious to and skyrocket your SMV. Use your wits to be better. I read a thread on a forum once where men were discussing how unfeminine women are and how *\"Even if she's a 5, if she's feminine she's an 8 to me\"* . That's right. I read that even before knowing about TRP and it made so much sense. \nStudy, observe, study, observe and never stop in your quest for becoming the best woman you can be. \n\n\n ","title":"Improving\/Skyrocketing your SMV outside your appearance: The Guide","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/3ydy5n\/improvingskyrocketing_your_smv_outside_your\/"}

When we met I was at the beginning of my college education with plans to become a lawyer, but my heart wasn't totally in it. I wanted, more than anything, to be a wife and partner, but the current state of American society made me feel like this wasn't enough and I needed to be ashamed of the fact that it didn't make money. I think I've carried this shame with me to some small extent until very recently. \n\nWhen I met my husband I knew right off the bat that he was brilliant, and could change the world. His job takes him all around the world, consulting where he is needed. This, obviously, is not compatible with being a lawyer, but I knew in my heart of hearts I would much rather be his best friend, support system, creating a home life for him wherever we landed, and serving as his confidant then spend my days doing legal paper work for other people. I knew this immediately, but still, it was important to us both that I have options, so I finished my education, graduated at the top of my class, then decided to marry him. With that came moving to a new state (sometimes a new country) every year or so... It's hard, like really hard, but I couldn't have ever asked for as much joy as I've had in life, and it's still early!\n\nEven with all that, I carried with me this nagging feeling that I wasn't contributing enough and needed to feel bad about not having a \"career.\" Is helper really enough?\n\nLast week we had dinner with one of his best friends in the same profession. He's in a serious relationship with a very nice Biology professor, and they spend 6-8 months a year apart. Still, they are a lovely, if unstable, couple, and as we left dinner with them I felt that old insecurity over my lack of profession rearing... \n\nUntil my husband looked over at me and said \"I'm glad we're not like them, it never would have worked. I'm so blessed that you chose to be by my side rather than chasing your own interests.\"\n\nYou guys, I melted. It's all worth it. Stay the course.

I try to be the best wife I can be. I\u2019ve read Laura Doyle\u2019s Surrendered Wife, I listen to Adrienne Everheart on YouTube. I truly enjoy the topic of how I can better serve my husband because it really makes me a better person as a whole and happier too. I understand my husband isn\u2019t reading books or listening to podcasts on how to be the best husband. I\u2019m not bitter about that, I understand men are different. \nMy husband is a great husband to me but sex has always been our biggest issue. I decided I could still marry him even knowing that I am very sexual and sex is important to me, because no one is perfect and all partners will come with imperfections and I am madly in love with him. I know he\u2019s shy.. kind of awkward.. and very \u201cvanilla\u201d in bed. \n\nAnyways- We are trying to conceive and I am ovulating this week, so we had a quickie this morning before he went to work... and I mean like 1 min quickie. It was fine, I really want to get pregnant so I don\u2019t mind the transactional sex at times. But after the morning sex, he said we can try again later. I was excited so I got waxed, showered, did my hair and make up, put on lingerie, and sent him a quick Snapchat of it. He said he couldn\u2019t wait to get home! Well of course he wanted it as soon as he stepped in the door and the sex, while great, lasted about 5 - maybe 7 minutes. And afterwards he didn\u2019t really say much.. I said did you like that? He said yeah, did you think I wouldn\u2019t? I\u2019m just sad he didn\u2019t say like, you look hot, or try and last longer so I can get off. He always finishes in sooner than 10 mins. Sometimes I can get off that quickly, but most of the time I can\u2019t. I have had conversations in the past (years ago) but it made things worse to the point where we went months with out sex and he could barely get it up.. he said he had a mental block because I complained that he didn\u2019t last long enough.\nHe\u2019s so awkward when I suggest porn or anything so I don\u2019t do that anymore... even though I know he watches or has at least. \nI\u2019ve learned to be happy and grateful and bite my tongue when I want to nag or complain. I\u2019m just sad that I try my very best to be a good wife and seems like he couldn\u2019t care less about being a good husband. \nAnother example : I sent him my love language quiz results and he barely read them (he couldn\u2019t tell me anything about them) while when he sent me his quiz results,  I read everything about how to cater to \u201cacts of service\u201d love language. \n\nIn the past, I peel my energy off him and live my best life because I don\u2019t attach my happiness to another person, but right now I am just really really sad. \n\nNot even sure what advice I\u2019m asking for here, maybe just someone else\u2019s perspective or someone to tell me they also have had this issue and have worked through it. \n\nThank you xo","title":"I\u2019m not sure if this topic is encouraged here but I\u2019m hoping it is..","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/jw4myp\/im_not_sure_if_this_topic_is_encouraged_here_but\/"}

Because of this, any group of women will tend towards homogeneity. The Red Pill has never been about a particular way of life, however, RPW slips into this mindset quite often.  It\u2019s not rare to see someone discussing the \u201cRPW Lifestyle\u201d or \u201cthings an RPW would or would not do\u201d. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is *problematic* (u\/guywithgirlwithabike does not like the word problematic but it tickles me pink \u2013 expect to see it pop up again). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe problem is that an \u201cRPW Lifestyle\u201d gives on the vague sense that there is checklist somewhere. If one were to find where on the darn sub we stashed the check list, she could follow it step by step, the heavens would part and she would be blessed with the most perfect blend of alpha-beta man that has ever walked the earth.  Now, I\u2019ve seen a pared down version of the TradCon checklist (thanks Mom!). That checklist says: graduate from school, find a job, get married, have sex, buy a house, have a kid. The details of *how* are a bit fuzzy and I\u2019ve never been one for checklist, still, it seems like a solid plan right? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell if I personally followed this plan, I\u2019d have married my high school sweetheart. This is something that HSSH and I long ago agreed would have ended in divorce within five years of the marriage. I\u2019ve never been good with checklists, they make me itchy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInstead we call RP a *toolbox*. The challenge about toolboxes is that they contain tools. You have to know how to [use tools properly]( https:\/\/www.picclickimg.com\/d\/l400\/pict\/273521503919_\/Vtg-The-Far-Side-Gary-LarsonMechanically-Declined-Graphic.jpg) or they don\u2019t work. Further, you need to know which tool is the right tool for any given situation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are partnered up, it\u2019s very easy to find the right tool. [Ask your man](https:\/\/redd.it\/42ruyb). \n\n* Should you have long hair or short hair? *What does your man like?* \n* Should your closet contain dresses or jeans? *What is your man attracted to?* \n* Stay at home or go to work? *What works best for your relationship?* \n\nCue the feminist outrage: \u201cYour own preferences matter!!\u201d they will shout. This is why the [no feminism](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/about\/rules\/) rule exists, it\u2019s exhausting to put caveats on everything but caveat I will. *Of course* you should be comfortable with the decisions but if you have a strong preference *why are you asking the internet what you should do?* \n\nOh, and if you ask your man\u2019s opinion and he says to use a hammer, don\u2019t insist that the screw driver is better. It will make him crazy and it\u2019s, dare I say it, disrespectful. Ask me how I know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow for you single ladies the questions are a bit different. You should be asking: \u201cwhat do *men* prefer\u201d then \u201cwhat do *the men I am attracted to* prefer\u201d and \u201chow limited will I be if I do this thing?\u201d. \n\nAn example: *I want to get a tattoo* - Now a lot of men might be turned off by tattoos so you might want to think twice. However, if your \u201ctype\u201d is Mr. Rockabilly then you are probably not going to have an issue with that full sleeve you want to get.  It isn\u2019t a problem to limit your options if your girl game is strong. Repeat after me: I don\u2019t need to attract *all men*, just *the right man*. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are some [\u201ctools\u201d or strategies]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/wiki\/index\/tableofcontents\/axioms) that will be consistent across all RPW. This is stated in the sidebar: \n\n> We come from all different walks of life, so on RPW you will find harmonious and productive discussions between very religious traditional conservative women and hardcore BDSM submissives and everyone in between. **What we all share is not a lifestyle, a set of values, or a worldview, but a way of relating to men.**\n\nThe biggies are: understanding our own nature, understanding male preferences (and the  more nuanced \u2013 understanding *your* man\u2019s preferences), submission, respect, sex. All these deserve their own rambling lecture so we\u2019ll save them for another day while the baby naps.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBefore we go, let\u2019s talk about areas of disagreement. This is where the \u201cRP is not TradCon\u201d distinction really comes to light. There are a few topics that are guaranteed to rile up the base. Among these (non-exhaustive): monogamy or polyamory\/open relationships, married v lifetime relationship, virginity and partner count. If RP was a checklist then there would be a concrete answer. Because it\u2019s not, it is entirely possible to be a polyamorous woman, in a lifetime relationship who has a n-count in the double digits, and still practice RPW techniques and strategies. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I challenge you to start thinking about RPW in terms of interactions with men and about how *effective* something is as a strategy. We can still talk about where to get a cute 50s style dress if you like (I have an adorable one for our Christmas Tea Party), but that dress doesn\u2019t make you an RPW, it just makes you a girl in a dress.","title":"Checklist or Toolbox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/deowuz\/checklist_or_toolbox\/"}

However, this isn't possible for several reasons. Therefore, this post will be a summary of a summary of a summary of what can really be written on this topic, feel free to add whatever important points you feel are missing in the comment section. I also will not be adding any links. All the evidence has been covered extensively by others and can be easily found in the various RP, MGTOW  and MRA subs, blogs and YouTube channels.\n\n**The olden days**\n\nGo back to before the industrial revolution and life was brutal and short. Poverty, starvation and serfdom were a way of life for most people. No one had rights, everyone had responsibility. Responsibility to your parents, your spouse, your children, your community and God. War and disease were real, ever present dangers that could strike at any moment.\n\nIn this context, the man was in charge of his family. He had to be, his wife needed him to be, his children needed him to be and his elderly parents needed him to be in charge of the household. As the strongest member of the family whose hormones don't yo-yo, it made most sense for him to be the undisputed leader. This was so out of necessity of life, not because men are tyrants nor because women are pushovers. There simply wasn't any other way to survive and raise the future generation.\n\n**Modernization**\n\nMassive, unprecedented changes swept over the world with the industrial revolution. The brute force of male muscle was being replaced by machines in factories. Sure, men still needed muscle to operate many of those old machines, but that was a step away from the back\\-breaking labor that preceded the invention of industry. Thus, men were slightly less needed in their traditional roles. The first seeds of feminism and rights for women soon followed. (Many other changes came to the world as a result, we will only focus on what's pertinent to this very specific discussion).\n\nAs society developed, the need for the husbands protection diminished due to communities being better protected against marauding bandits and the like. The need for the husbands provision was diminished because women can also operate many of the machines which required less and less brute muscle power. The idea of equality for women became more and more of a debate in its many manifestations. This was never a viable thought before the industrial revolution because there was no way a woman could survive in the world without a man in her life.\n\n**The birth control pill**\n\nThe one thing that drastically changed the debate and was perhaps the main contributing factor to ushering in second wave feminism and the sexual revolution of the 60\"s was the birth control pill. With the pill, a woman could have sex without the risk of pregnancy! This is when marriage took the bullet of death, the institution has been bleeding out ever since.\n\nIn the past, if a woman got pregnant out of wedlock, she was royally screwed. In the distant past, she had little chance of survival in the harsh elements even if she wasn't pregnant, nursing or raising a child. Since the industrial revolution, she could work in a factory, but that wasn't possible while pregnant and nursing etc. Getting pregnant had **serious life altering consequences** and that's why women were extremely selective about whom they had sex with. For this reason, women **needed** marriage as a form of security before you were allowed to even think about sex.\n\nAll this changed with the pill. Women were now free to have consequence free sex, **and that's exactly what they did!** Women \"threw off\" the old shackles of \"sexual oppression\" and were now \"liberated\". Men went along with it because what man wants to turn down free sex? Please see - [Women are the gatekeepers of sex\\]([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8dgnhj\/back\\_to\\_the\\_basics\\_women\\_are\\_the\\_gatekeepers\\_of\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8dgnhj\/back_to_the_basics_women_are_the_gatekeepers_of\/))\n\n**The Red Pill**\n\nAs you can see, feminism evolved as a natural result of modernization. Various mini evolution processes within feminism can be traced to specific developments in modern invention that raised the standard of life and thus diminished the absolute need for a husband to a need that was less absolute and then less of a need. To discuss each specific step along the way is way too long and has been covered extensively by others. The point here is to observe **that** these changes coincide with ever shifting changes in the standard of living and the family dynamic.\n\nAll this led to greater and greater freedoms for women and unleashed female sexuality in a way the world has never seen. Never before was female sexuality unrestrained like it is today. At first, remnants of old values still existed and so it wasn't that bad for men. However, as time progressed and society continued to shift, the individual man became less and less needed to the individual woman while the collective man (via the government) became more and more the replacement husband. Women began demanding things from the government and the government husband began to fulfill those demands because women are the majority of the voters. Divorce laws, child custody laws, laws pertaining to domestic and sexual violence all began shifting in a manner that favors women and mistreats men.\n\nAdditionally, female sexuality is \\[hypergamous\\]([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8fujkz\/back\\_to\\_the\\_basics\\_hypergamy\/] (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8fujkz\/back_to_the_basics_hypergamy\/)) This resulted in more and more men being deemed undesirable and excluded from the sexual market place. Most of these men aren't objectively undesirable, they would have made wonderful husbands in the past. They have **become** undesirable due to unrestrained hypergamy.\n\nFurthermore, men began to notice how much the game was rigged against them. Free love is only free if you're on top of the attractiveness scale, otherwise you have to pay. Even if you do take on a wife and happily pay for her, she can leave you at any time for any reason and take away most of what you worked for through alimony and child support. She can claim domestic abuse and she'll be believed, she can claim rape and she'll be believed. As a man, your life can be over if any of these things happen to you, how much more so is your life over if all of them happen.\n\n**A bitter, bitter pill**\n\nThus, The Red Pill was born. Men began forming online communities and  trading notes with each other. Some men were burned through divorce and\/or false allegations. Some were burned through harsher trials and longer prison sentences for the same crimes. Some were excluded from the sexual market place. **Some weren't burned at all**, they simply watched others get burned from touching the hot stove and decided not to do the same.\n\nThe logical conclusion is to walk away from all women until the pendulum swings back to a normal, fair and sustainable place. However, this is **not easy at all!** Men have a **tremendous** sexual drive that is insanely massive and ever present. Forgoing women and sex altogether is nearly impossible for most men. So what's a man to do? How does one engage with the positive sides of women without being burned by the ever increasing negative side? This inner struggle is why taking TRP is so bitter for men. This is why most men don't take TRP, **TRP is forced down the throat of men by women** in most cases. Women instinctively know this, that's why the first question often is \\- who hurt you?\n\nThe answer to this question (how to engage without being burned) is a topic of great debate in TRP communities. The first thing many men try is the MRA route. This seems the most sensible way to restore equilibrium. However, the MRA has been around for quite some time with no real results. This is because feminism is the natural outgrowth of societal changes that released biological tendencies (as explained above). Therefore, while every RP man believes in the MRA, most aren't willing to engage in a futile battle. Instead, some will enjoy the decline through learning game and pumping and dumping. Some will incorporate RP ideas within their marriages. Some will go MGTOW. There's no objectively true answer as all the options are disgustingly bitter pills to swallow.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFeminism was a natural result of hidden\/squashed biological traits of female sexuality being released due to modernization. TRP is male self preservation being unleashed as a direct progression from feminism. TRP is contrary to the core of male sexual desire and is therefore an extremely bitter pill to swallow, albeit extremely necessary.\n\nCheers!","title":"Back to the basics - the creation of TRP","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8grzna\/back_to_the_basics_the_creation_of_trp\/"}

Your mix of alpha\/beta may be completely different from my mix of alpha\/beta but there are certain aspects of masculinity and male thinking that are going to be close to universal, AMALT if you will. \n\nThese foundations of masculine thinking are of the utmost importance for women to understand if we hope to create happy fulfilling relationships for both ourselves and our partners. \n\n[For Women Only](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-About\/dp\/B00DGYRKGE\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523544395&sr=8-1&keywords=for+women+only) had a huge impact on the way that I understood my Husband and helped me to start making tweaks to my behavior that lead us to a happier more harmonious relationship. \n\nThe author surveyed (American) men from all walks of life and reported her findings in this book. She takes a (mostly) amoral approach to the way that men think and feel. She dives into their inner lives through anecdotes and the results of her questionnaires, finding some key commonalities that most men share. \n\nSome of the book leans on a Christian worldview. I will be glossing over the parts that I do not believe are applicable across the board, but I will touch on them if it makes sense. The information is solid regardless of your background. I\u2019m not a churchgoer myself, so I\u2019m asking for a bit of trust on this. \n\nThere is *also* \u201cFor Men Only\u201d that deals with the inner workings of women. One idea (not mine) is to read both books together with your partner and discuss the differences in how men and women approach the world. The author mentions that many churches have begun to use this for their pre-marriage classes. \n\nI **highly** recommend that everyone picks up this book. The Audible version is read by the author and is about a 4 hour listen while you are going about your day. You won\u2019t regret the time. \n\nThat said, I know my personal backlog of reading is enormous. So for everyone who doesn\u2019t have the time, energy or Audible account to go through this herself, I\u2019ll be writing summaries of each chapter. For the sake of brevity (something I\u2019m not good at as you may have noticed) I\u2019m going to stick to the authors words, advice and opinions in each post. The posts will be long enough doing just that. If you have questions or need something expanded upon, I\u2019ll happily get into that in the comments with you. \n\nFinally, of note, the author uses surveys and interviews. In no case does she say that ALL men feel a particular way. Her research shows that *most* men behave or think as described. [Let\u2019s generalize about men](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lu3FE7BswYI) rather than discuss why \u201cmy guy isn\u2019t like that\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a girl and I do that too\u201d.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n[For Women Only - Respect and Love - Chapter 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8cnh7l\/for_women_only_respect_and_love_chapter_2\/)","title":"'For Women Only' - I read books so you don't have to - Intro","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8cndeb\/for_women_only_i_read_books_so_you_dont_have_to\/"}

Follow these rules and you'll definitely earn more respect. \n\n1. Stop cursing. Every time you say \"fuck\" or \"shit\" it's a turn off. Try substituting them for something else like \"stuff\". \n\n2. Cook more\/bake more if you can. Colleges usually have communal kitchens or if you're living in a dorm with a kitchen, try to cook something on the stove instead of microwaving things. I've started to bring baked goods and share them with my classmates (male & female) and people always have a positive response. \n\n3. If it's nice out (spring\/summer), wear a dress. Yesterday, I was walking around and I had a female stranger at Chipotle compliment me along with my two male classmates. If you make the effort, people notice. \n\n4. Spend less time on your phone when you walk around & smile. It's so easy to walk around campus, have resting bitch face, and be on your phone. Don't be that girl. You might be that girl and not even realize it. Take more time out to walk without your phone.  I've practiced smiling at strangers when I walk and I've been getting compliments and guys are more willing to ask me questions, tourists are more willing to ask me for directions (I live in a big city), and guys talk to me more. \n\n5. Become interested in something on campus where you're involved with men (aside from baking, artsy stuff). \nI've been going to pick-up soccer games and been watching more soccer matches to learn more about my favorite teams. I've also been upping my language game and been learning more German and French since those are my favorite two languages. Watching soccer is fun but I also get to surround myself with quality guys who are athletic\/masculine. \n\n6. Never have sex before you know that you're in an exclusive, committed thing. Know that as a woman, you're the gatekeeper of sex and when you give that up too easily, it's hard for a guy to actually see you more as a plate. \nThis was the toughest lesson I had to accept but it's so true. \n\n7. Never tell a guy that you want to \"go watch a movie\" because that's basically code for sex before you've established boundaries. You're going to end up having sex. \n\n8. On Facebook, don't take any pictures with red solo cups, drinking, partying, spring break pictures, etc. It's trashy and if you have any delete them even if there's just one of them up there. You will differentiate yourself between 90% of the women of on your campus. Also, selfies are kinda dumb. \n\n9. This is kinda debatable but I've stopped initiating kissing when and if I go out on a date with someone. I honestly believe that if the guy is really into you, he'll kiss you first assuming you've given out all the right signs. \n\n10. Skincare is important. Go to a dermatologist and get your acne\/eye bags\/other skin problems treated so you look good naturally. \n\n11. In college, you're going to be tempted to join Greek life, go to fraternities, and go out to bars\/clubs. Now, even though I'm a fan of Greek life and I have friends in sororities, none of them have ever met their boyfriends at a fraternity party even though some of their bf's might be Greek.If you do join a sorority, learn about their reputations. Just remember that any place with alcohol is never conducive to meeting your future bf. \n\n12. Having a boyfriend is never your end goal. You must keep improving yourself as a woman and that's gonna take time. \n\n13. I stopped drinking two months ago for good. I went from being drunk at pregames to drinking a beer or two to quitting. It's been a journey but honestly, l don't regret the decision. I think it's okay to have alcohol every now and then but honestly, I think I'm better without it. \n\n14. Don't date a guy based on looks alone and don't justify your plate status because the guy you're seeing is hot. He's hot and he knows it. And chances are, if you're a plate and he doesn't want to commit to you, he probably isn't committing to you or anyone. Again, if you go into something with the intentions of wanting an LTR, leave with those same intentions. \n\n","title":"Things I've learned as a 19-year-old in college","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/3323c8\/things_ive_learned_as_a_19yearold_in_college\/"}

He told me that had wanted to try fixing things around the house for years, but she never let him, and so he figured he must not be good enough to do it.

Maybe that wasn't the right thing for me to do, but when I said that, he instantly lit up. I just couldn't handle seeing him so sad, and he was a lot happier the rest of the day. \n\nWe as women tend to think stuff like that doesn't matter, but it does. Men love to help us and to feel capable. Let them.

This week we are transitioning from the concept of respect and submission to the actuality of respect and submission.\n\nThe Captain-First Mate metaphor is an example of a RP relationship.  This post details all of the duties and responsibilities of a good and competent First Mate.\n\n*****\n\n#The Essential Duties of the First Mate by u\/FleetingWish\n\nWe often refer to the relationship as the \"Captain and First Mate Dynamic\". The Captain is in charge of the ship, and the First Mate follows his lead. The term \"First Mate\" is used to mean that the women is not a passive bystander on the ship, or in the relationship. A competent First Mate can be relied on to take on duties that the Captain is not in the best position to do. These are the tasks that women are best suited for, or duties that the Captain is unable or unwilling to do. If the First Mate performs her essential duties, then the ship will run smoothly and the relationship will be a peaceful and happy one. \n\nI have categorized the essential duties of the First Mate into 5 categories. They are: \n\n1. Morale Officer\n2. Reporting Ship Status\n3. Carrying-out Assigned Duties\n4. Supporting Your Captain\n5. Ship Maintenance\n\n###Morale Officer\n\nThe First Mate's main duty is to keep spirits on the ship high. This becomes especially important to keep in mind when there are sources of tension. Being the Morale Officer means you are the soft place to land. You are not only a huge source of joy in his life, you are more often the solution to his problems, rather than the creator of them. You are not the cause of his headaches, you are the person he turns to that can relieve them. You are there to cure tension. The following techniques are a grab-bag of possibilities, use the ones the best suit your lifestyle. The more the better!\n\n*Techniques of the Morale Officer*\n\n- Sex. This is the most important because it is the main way men give and feel that they receive affection. It is also a huge way to distress. You should be having sex with him or giving him blow jobs frequently, ideally at least once a day.\n\n- Always great him with a smile on your face to show him how happy you are to see him.\n\n- Have dinner is ready for him the moment he walks in from a long hard day at work\n\n- Prepare him a lunch to take with him to work, leave a note in it to tell him you love him\n\n- Wake up early in the morning to prepare breakfast so you can eat it together before he leaves.\n\n- If you have a busy lifestyle, even a hot cup of coffee, a ice cold beer or a tall glass of ice water can work wonders.\n\n- If he needs some time to decompress after work, leave him alone for a bit. He will come to you when he's ready.\n\n- Massages: Head\/Scalp, back, feet. Spend time just pampering him.\n\n- Pay special attention to his love language and communicate to him using it.\n\n- Don't ignore the other love languages. For example, if \"words of affirmation\" doesn't communicate that you love him, he still will get an ego boost from being complimented.\n\n- Keep a positive attitude. Your default mode should be happiness. If things go wrong try to find the silver lining, or treat at as a small set back. You are the optimist.\n\n- Initiate play with him. Laugh, giggle, make jokes, chase him, squeal when he grabs your butt... whatever. Play is a great way for adults to unwind and it is often forgotten.\n\n###Reporting Ship Status \n\nAnother essential duty of being a First Mate is reporting to your Captain everything that is going on with the ship. This ensures that he has to have all the information he needs to make good decisions. Remember that [you are a team](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6hkgqv\/you_are_a_team\/?st=jnl0a4z3&amp;amp;amp;sh=1c8f2344). Every time you do not give him the information he needs, you are actively hindering his ability to be a good captain.\n\n*Do:*\n\n- Tell him how you are feeling.\n\n- Tell him is something unexpected has gone wrong.\n\n- Let him know what is going on in your life.\n\n- Tell him if he missed his exit on the freeway.\n\n- Let him know your thoughts on possible plans he may have, and concerns that may arise.\n\n*Do not:*\n\n- Tell him how to solve a problem you have presented him with. Remember to [bring him your problem not your solution.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4i8ukh\/bring_your_captain_your_problem_not_your_solution\/?st=jnl0inp7&amp;amp;amp;sh=56220851)\n\n- Undermine his authority in any way.\n\n- Complain about his choices.\n\n###Carrying-out Assigned Duties\n\nWe often get questions about if it's okay if the woman of the house takes care of the finances, or if the man does the cooking. Absolutely, because that is how the Captain has delegated tasks. Any task that is assigned to you by your Captain becomes one of your essential duties as a first mate. They must be completed with the competence and care that you would give to any other task. The Captain may insert himself into these tasks to make sure they are done to his standards and meet his approval, but he is assigning them to you because he trusts your judgement to be able to take care of all of it (or most of it) on your own.\n\nBy taking things off his plate, and handling them well, you take a lot of stress off his plate that he might otherwise have. You are also showing to him that the trust that he has put into you in being able to complete these tasks has not been misplaced.\n\n\n###Supporting Your Captain\n\nWhen your Captain is taking the helm it is important that he feels that you and others believe in him, but especially you. Men don't exist on an island, even if they don't appear it, men are absolutely effected by how people view him. If you believe in him, he will be able to believe in himself. If you think he will succeed, it will make him feel empowered to fight. Even if things look glum, you rooting in his corner will give him the strength he needs to keep pushing through. \n\nThere are two ways of supporting your captain. The first is backing his play, the second is helping to create a favorable impression of others about him.\n\n*Backing His Play*\n\nBacking his play means whatever his final decision is, you are on board. You not only will go along with it, but actively believe in the objective. Your duties are to encourage him, be the morale officer, and do anything you can to help the objective become a reality. Whatever the objective is, make yourself part of the solution rather than another obstacle he has to overcome. \n\n- If he wants quit his job to go back to school, you start by helping put together a budget, and tell him what you're going to cut back on.\n\n- If he wants to build you a table and he's never done it before, you smile and tell him how excited you are to see the final product.\n\n- If he's feeling frustrated, let him know that you know he'll power through, because you've seen what he is capable of.\n\n*Creating a Favorable Impression*\n\nYour Captain's availability of options can often depend on his ability to influence people. For example, people are promoted most often because they are well liked rather than because they are the hardest working. It is also true that other people having a favorable impression of him will give him more confidence that he can use to excel. There are two methods of creating a positive impression of others.\n\n1. Simply talking him up, and never talking badly about him in front of others. When he comes up in conversation talk about all the wonderful things about him, and never mention anything negative. Focus the conversation about what he's capable of, even if he's not around.\n\n2. Reflecting well on him. A man is judged by others based the woman who is around his arm. If she is attractive, pleasant, and always arrives to functions with a well executed home-cooked dish to share, those around will think that he was able to get such a good woman by being a quality man. By presenting a positive, well put-together appearance, of the woman by his side, people will automatically assume good things about him. \n\n###Ship Maintenance \n\nThe last category is meant to encompass all the little things that make life just go smoother. They are not things that he has asked you to do, they are just things that need to be done, and when they're done there's less reason for tension. Here's a list of examples:\n\n- Making sure the kids are up in the morning.\n\n- Cleaning the kitchen before it needs to be cooked in.\n\n- If the electricity company calls asking why the bill hasn't been paid, if he forgot just pay it.\n\n- Checking that there is always plenty of toilet paper.\n\n- Keeping the house in order, just in case guests come over.\n\n- Having the clothes cleaned and put away before they are needed.\n\n- Etc...\n\n###Conclusion\n\nBy remembering the 5 essential duties of the First Mate, you will be on your way to making yourself a woman worthy of a good man, and creating a relationship that is a positive experience for everyone involved.","title":"Back to Basics September: the Essential Duties of the First Mate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pu41u9\/back_to_basics_september_the_essential_duties_of\/"}

I feel that women nowadays have trouble vetting between men who just want to have fun and men who are marriage minded. \n\n**Remember:** It is YOUR responsibility to vet carefully before going too deep into a relationship that could be taking advantage of your precious time and energy. Tingles from an \"alpha\" man can easily take over your judgment!\n\nHere are some qualities to look for in **men who date with the goal of marriage:**\n\n1) Family oriented - does he visit his parents during the holidays or does he go out partying with friends? If he has siblings, are they married or in committed LTRs? Does he have a good relationship with his parents? If a man doesn't have a sense of belonging to his family that brought him up, then he'll be less likely to want a sense of belonging as an adult.\n\n2) Social circle - does he have a select few guy friends or a big social circle that includes friends that are girls? Men who are social butterflies tend to need new and exciting people in their lives and are less likely to settle down. Look for men who have a few close guy friends he spends time with. He'll be more likely to choose one woman by his side rather than many.\n\n3) Stable job - does he have a job that brings in consistent money, or does he have many ambitions? Overly ambitious men can seem attractive and give you tingles, but be careful! It's either a sign of selfishness (ego, narcissism) or financial instability (freelance life). There is a significant difference between men who have careers solely for themselves vs men who have careers to support a family. I work in an artistic field so I have witnessed many of these men with \"exciting new projects\" that may give you tingles but guess what? They tend to cheat, have many girlfriends or have no money.\n\n5) Character - does he follow through with what he says he will do? Is he direct in his communication? Sometimes women can be put off by how blunt or direct men can be, but the opposite is a smooth talking crooning guy who can talk you into something you don't know what you're getting into. Similarly, marriage minded men (and men who will be committed husbands) are able to stay on task, even if there bumps on the road. They will be natural problem solvers that keep their eyes ahead long-term.\n\nAs my father says: \"Look for a husband who is smart, has a stable job and a good heart, respect him, and take care of him.\"","title":"On vetting marriage minded men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/7pejni\/on_vetting_marriage_minded_men\/"}

I thought that men would be more attracted to a woman who was sexually unapologetic. Someone who is great in the sack and won't be a nag if he didn't give her attention. \n\nI was the strong feminist girl who was going to get a high powered career before even thinking of marriage. Growing old alone was an option too. It was when I started reading this blog by Renee (http:\/\/www.thefemininewoman.com) did I learn more about my true nature as a woman. I listened to my heart, the true woman in me, and I could feel her calling, begging me to stop what I was doing. \n\nI kept nodding at all the points that Renee discussed in her blog. That women are denying themselves the happiness they're looking for by chasing their career, material things, sexual liberation, and all that. She was right. I tried to apply my newly learned lessons to my relationship at that time. I did all the household work. I was more expressive of my emotions. While still maintaining independence working two jobs. This narcissist I was with took advantage of me. I thought that by changing the way I behaved, he would be inspired to change too. But there's no hope when it comes to these people because even they cannot see through their own bullshit.\n\nI finally ended the highly toxic relationship after seven grueling months before I met my true equal. My alpha. My soulmate. The man who I know will protect me and provide for our future family.\n\nThe previous relationship damaged me but not so much that it kept me from opening my heart to this new man. He was everything I had been looking for and if not without my knowledge on the red pill and true femininity, I wouldn't have been ready to handle a man such as him.\n\nI make him happy, and he makes me happy. Sometimes, I will purposely act all cute around him and let him chase me around the room because it's exciting. It gives us both the andrenaline rush you rarely see in most couples these days where the woman is so uptight and the man is too afraid to approach her for fear of her wrath. \n\nI donno. Maybe it's just me but there are too many more women in the society that I live in who are still asleep and enjoying the feminist dream. I want to help them realize what I realized. I cannot count with my toes and fingers alone the number of men I have slept with. I thought it liberated me to sleep with men without feeling any remorse but in the recent years, it has only made me feel shitty.\n\nEven though I am happy in my relationship right now, I suffer from the choices I have made in the past. I have difficulties creating a bond with my partner and sometimes I feel like I am a fraud when I'm being affectionate to him. I know that I really do love him but I doubt my emotions sometimes. I recently discovered that it's probably my low oxytocin levels because of the many men I have slept with in the past. I felt bad but there's no use dwelling in the past. The only way to repair it is to increase oxytocin levels which I found out can be achieved through hugging, kissing, expressing your emotions. Basically things that you would do to express affection to your partner.\n\nI am very happy with where I am right now. I cannot believe a simple woman like me would be able to ignite such a huge change in the man of my dreams, who once had a dark past too and sometimes, continues to have a dark outlook in life. He worships me, and I submit to him. What an amazing thing we women can achieve if we just surrender.\n\nLadies, if you are looking for true love, you won't find it through a hook up or a friends with benefits arrangement though that have worked for some. I am saying. We are a rare breed. Many men have lost hope in women because of the man hating culture that the feminist movement has created. Don't be one of those women who will insult him, embarrass him in front of his friends, or backbite him to your girlfriends.\n\nRemember to respect him. It's really that simple.

I was 20something, convinced that my miserable situation was the result of literally anything other than my own actions. I had a horrible view of myself, of other women, of men, of the entire world. I was angry and not willing to take a single step toward *changing*, I genuinely had begun to resign myself to what I thought life was going to be forever. What I found was shocking and hard to believe\u2026 yet I stayed up way too late that night, reading and thinking. And I kept coming back. And it changed *everything* for me (well, almost everything - I still don\u2019t have any fondness for the woman that got me here, but that\u2019s another story). \n\nOnce I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I couldn\u2019t ignore what I had learned here, it was like a lightbulb came on over my head and I knew exactly what I needed to do. I had to take control,  and to do that I had to dig in my heels, admit that I was causing every single one of my problems, and get my sh*t together NOW. \n\nI came here every night before bed to read posts and advice and learn what it meant to truly love yourself. I realized my anger at the world and my belief that I was doomed\/helpless stemmed from unchecked mental health issues; I went to therapy and really committed to healing, started journaling and doing the hard work of looking for my own flaws and improving them. I looked at my dating history and asked myself why I sought out and accepted \u201crelationships\u201d from men who were, simply put, losers who had no respect for me and why I held the belief that I *needed* to fix them no matter the cost. I asked myself what I wanted for my life and my future - and I was *shocked* to realize I had no idea at all. So I took a leap of faith and accepted a perfectly-timed offer from a family member to move across the country and live with them. \n\nIn a new place where I knew no one, I laser-focused on myself; I went into nun-mode, joined a gym (and actually went!), found a skincare routine that worked for me, and started to get a clearer picture of what I wanted and what I was determined to get for my future. It wasn\u2019t easy and I made mistakes, but I learned from them and all the work I was doing in myself paid off as I realized I was able to create\/enforce boundaries and let myself walk away from anything that didn\u2019t align with my new found goals. \n\nI started this journey at 23 years old. I\u2019m now 25 and since finding RPW and using the tools I took from it, I am the best version of myself that I have ever been. I have never felt more beautiful or comfortable in my own body, my skin is clear and I\u2019ve lost 50lbs (now I\u2019m at the lower end of the healthy BMI and am focusing on toning)! I will finish classes and start my career in April, and I start my first \u201cgrown up\u201d job in my field this week - a position that will allow me to learn from people further along than me and give me a huge headstart when school ends. I just bought my first car and am in the process of getting debt-free after years of being financially unstable and irresponsible. And the cherry on top? Along the way I met the most wonderful man who never makes me doubt myself, who loves me and supports me in a way I didn\u2019t know happened outside of fiction, and who fully embodies what it means to be a strong and worthy Captain - and we just started looking at engagement rings. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about making this post for weeks, and tonight I was so full of gratitude and pride in how far I\u2019ve come that I finally did it. I couldn\u2019t have done this without the advice, tough love, and support of the RPW community. This post is partially to celebrate myself, but more than that this post is a LOUD and EMPHATIC *THANK YOU!!!!!* to this community that I cannot mean more sincerely. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, I appreciate you.

Please forgive me if in my clumsiness I hurt or offend anyone.\n\n\nI was reading an article on working mother's guilt and the effect of external childcare on young children. It read something like this:\n\n> \"The development of a secure attachment to her primary caregivers is crucial for the child's happiness, stability and emotional development. The child needs a consistent and appropriate response to her needs, but the mother is not the only figure who can provide this response. The primary attachment figure can be a parent, a relative, a nanny...\"\n\n\nI don't judge anyone for needing or wanting to work. I don't think children will grow up traumatized by daycare. I don't believe a nanny can ever replace a loving mother (ETA: a mother who's actually trying hard to spend time and bond with her children) as an attachment figure, be it a SAHM or a working mother. Please, do not take it as a judgement on anyone's choices or situation, because it is NOT.\n\n\nBut... how INSULTING is it to mothers? And to children? Stay-at-home or working, the attachment a child forms to her mother cannot be compared to that of a paid nanny. How insulting is it to SAHMs, who are definitely not replaceable by a nanny. How insulting is it to working mothers who get told they're not \"there\" enough to be the primary attachment figure. And this was presented as a positive... \"oh don't worry if you send your child to daycare, she'll get the very basis of her emotional development and sense of emotional safety from the nanny! Yeah, the one paid to look after your child, who definitely doesn't care about your child as much as you do, and who might disappear from your child's life tomorrow without a warning.\"\n\n\nI am disgusted. How can someone present this possibilty as a positive one. In an effort to \"liberate\" women from mom guilt, they're telling them that their worthless\/replaceable, and telling children that their emotional stability should depend on the nanny's contract expiry date. Mothers are worth way more than that.\n\n**EDIT** I am not referring to children in boarding schools, with wet nurses and governesses etc. I am talking here about parents who are trying to form a close relationship with their children, take care of them personally as much as possible and spend time with them. I do not believe that telling these mothers \"Oh your child will be fine even if you work, because her primary attachment figure can be the nanny\/daycare worker\" is reassuring, respectful of the mother's role, or (if it were true) positive for the child's development. Paid workers \"can't\" be the primary attachment figure because it's not good for young children - it's possible of course, but not positive. I believe children *will* be fine with working mothers, but for different reasons, not because the nanny becomes the key figure.\n\n\n\n\/rant","title":"No, a nanny can't be a child's primary attachment figure.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/xe1w8a\/no_a_nanny_cant_be_a_childs_primary_attachment\/"}

For some context, I feel like him and I actually have a pretty healthy relationship where we always communicate our boundaries\/feelings with one another, and don\u2019t often get into arguments. With that being said, we both agreed early on in our relationship that he\u2019d stop watching porn for many reasons, but mainly because it made me uncomfortable and I felt like it could lead to unhealthy expectations or even just an overall unhealthy relationship with real sex.

Ultimately, I know that it is unrealistic to expect him to never find another woman attractive or even watch some sort of explicit videos, given the plethora of soft core porn tiktoks and bikini Instagram models that get posted daily (that\u2019s actually not what I expect at all), but I guess I was just kind of sad to see that.

In addition, many of the teams he works with have goals that are diametrically opposed (one group is tasked with ensuring the product\u2019s safety while the other group is tasked with ensuring on-time delivery and cost-effectiveness, etc.) This causes him a lot of stress. \n\nBefore he got his degree, he used to be a blue-collar worker kind of \u201con the other side of\u201d his current job. He sometimes muses that he would be more fulfilled if he had not gone to college and instead progressed in that career track. He would have taken on apprentices, etc...\n\nHe dreads going back to work after the weekends.\n\nAt this point in my life I can\u2019t much relate to that feeling.

When you are asking yourself why your SO is getting in your way all day and just exactly what *is* he doing anyway ... read this post as a reminder that equality is not as important as *happiness*. \n \n\n***\n\nEvery time we get a woman asking about our relationships, concerned that they might not be \u201cequal enough\u201d, we always give the same canned response, which amounts to \u201cWe have different responsibilities, but we are *equally* important.\u201d This, however, is disingenuous. \n\nIt is almost as though we have bought into their line that equality is important, and that if things aren\u2019t \u201cequal\u201d, then they must be bad and we must be oppressed.  But, using the word \u201cequal\u201d makes no sense when talking about a red pill relationship. It\u2019s not as though I can say \u201cHe makes more money than I do, but I wash the dishes, so everything is equal!\u201d That\u2019s not how it works, we can\u2019t measure those things on the same scale. I have no idea how many washed dishes it takes to be equal to his extra hours at the office. \n\nWhen claiming to be equal, we are focusing on the wrong things, whether our contributions to the relationship matches his. But, that\u2019s not what\u2019s important, what is important is that we are doing our best to make him happy. In a relationship, it is your responsibility to make sure to do everything in your power to make the other person happy, and if you picked a good captain, he will do the same for you. \n\nIn a way the type of equality we do have is that our obligation to make him happy is equally as important as his obligation to make us happy. We are the most important people in our partners\u2019 lives and we have responsibility to make sure that we influence them in a positive way. Of course, since men and women are different, the things that involves are going to be different.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t wash the dishes because he makes more money than I do. I am not keeping score of whose duties are more important, who works the hardest, and who has done what for whom lately. I wash the dishes because it is one of the things I can do to fill his happiness bar, then he comes by and smacks me on the butt, because that\u2019s one of the things that fills my happiness bar. It\u2019s based on the principle that if you do things to make him happy, he\u2019ll want to do things to make you happy, which in turn makes you want to do things to make him happy, and so on. It is a positive reinforcement cycle that encourages both parties to fill the other\u2019s happiness bars. \n\nThat is what is important about you duties, not whether they are equally hard, equally time consuming, or even equally important, it\u2019s whether you are going above and beyond to make him happy, even if at first it means doing more than him. No, that\u2019s not equal, but so what?

Today he texted me asking \u201care you dating other guys already?\u201d Which completely took me off guard. I have not even come remotely close to dating anyone else; I make it a point not to hang out with other guys alone and make sure I have girlfriends with me. This is a change that I have made in order to continue our relationship together. \n\nIt turns out he found my dream journal. In my dream I was on a date with a stranger who tried to put his arm around me. I remembered that I had a boyfriend and left. In the dream I was angry about being neglected by my partner and wanted to end the relationship (this is when he had been ignoring me with no explanation for 3 days in real life). Other parts of the dream included hurting my leg on an escalator and trying to lose my phone. The dream before that was one where I was getting chased by witches. \n\nI told him that what he read was just a dream that I had. He said that what he read was unacceptable and that he already had two dates set up for this week. \n\nI apologized and asked for him to allow me to explain myself and make it up to him. He said that he would allow that but that I would have to work hard to get things back on track and that he is still going on those dates. He brought up some other mistakes that I have made in the past as further reasoning behind his decision (which I had apologized for and changed my behavior accordingly).\n\nI am really devastated by this. I am shocked that he basically broke up with me without trying to clarify or discuss anything about what happened. And I feel really frustrated because I don\u2019t even really think I did anything wrong \u2014 I had a dream and I wrote it down. \n\nPrior to this, we had been in a monogamous relationship. I put in a lot of hard work and effort into this relationship \u2014 cooking, baking, dressing up, working out, wearing make up. Our sex life is great. I don\u2019t know how I can try harder. I do all of this on top of a 70-80 hour work week. \n\nI am planning on making an apple cake and a shepherd\u2019s pie to make up. I am hopeful that I can explain myself but I feel so discouraged. Do you think that his reaction is reasonable? Do you think my frustration is warranted? I don\u2019t know how to proceed. Sometimes I feel like I try my hardest but can\u2019t succeed.

Below, I\u2019ve listed some of the important traits you should consider before embarking on a serious relationship. It\u2019s filtered through my own tastes and preferences, but I\u2019ve tried to make it general enough so that it applies to women in general. For some of the options, there's no right or wrong answer, but it's important that you're both on the same page. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Conscientiousness\/follow through. When he says he\u2019ll do something, does he do it? Or is he a terminal procrastinator? Is he dependable?\n   * Nagging is unattractive to men, so get a man who doesn\u2019t need to be nagged and will do the things he\u2019s supposed to do without you having to play the role of his mother. Common advice here is not to nag a man and to inspire him to do his best by being loving and attentive. News flash: this only works if your husband isn\u2019t an irresponsible slob. \n   * In a similar vein: cleaning. Is his house decently organized? Are there giant piles of dirty dishes in his sink? Are all of his belongings in huge piles, or neatly stowed away? Does he arrive at events on time? All of this is tied to conscientiousness. \n* Attitudes about money. \n   * How much does he spend on luxuries, like eating out and going on trips? How much does he save every month? 40% of adults cannot cover an emergency expense of $400, which means that a majority of adults are grossly financially irresponsible. To what extent does he value \u201cenjoying the moment\u201d vs. saving for the future?\n   * Is he generous? Does he want to treat you, or does he expect you to Venmo you back the $3.32 for coffee? Is he comfortable with you treating him? (The extent to which your finances are entangled will probably change over the course of your relationship as your status goes from date>girlfriend>long term girlfriend>wife, but enduring attitudes about money will not.)\n* Family. \n   * Is he on good terms with his parents? Will his family make your life difficult? Did his parents model a healthy relationship when he was a child? Do they expect to have a role in raising potential future children? Do they have different cultural expectations than your family? How loyal is he to them (e.g. would he loan his sister money or let her stay at his house if she was down on her luck)? What kind of family dynamic does he want with you?\n* Attitudes about work. \n   * Some people consider their job to be a focal point in their life. Some consider it a life goal to earn as much as possible. Others consider their job just something they do so they can live a comfortable life. Where does he fall on the spectrum? How much of his life and energy does he want to devote to work, vs. other things (like hobbies, spending time with you, raising a family)? \n   * Are you on the same page with regards to having children? Do you have similar philosophies about what role the parents should play in child rearing?\n* Dealing with conflict. \n   * Sometimes, you\u2019ll need to be direct and tell him that something about his behavior needs to change, or you\u2019ll need to address a problem in the relationship. Is he open to criticism? Or does he get angry and lash out? Does he refuse to talk about certain things, or get prickly and irritated often?\n   * When he comes to you with problems, is he tactful and direct? Or does he stew in his own discontentedness before he finally explodes? Does he readily tell you about things that bother him and provide a reasonable solution?\n* Emotional Calm\/Stoicism. Does he complain a lot? Does he panic when things don\u2019t go according to plan?\n* Respect. \n   * Does he respect you? Does he value your opinions and preferences? Is he respectful to your friends and people like service and retail workers?\n   * Alternately, do people respect him? Will he be a doormat if other people mistreat him or you? Can he stand up for himself?\n* Humor! Does he make you laugh? Do you feel relaxed and happy around him? Or do you feel like you\u2019re putting on a performance?\n\nThings I think are OVER emphasized when it comes to relationships:\n\n* Shared music\/hobbies\/TV shows. I consider this to be the icing on the cake, not a core part of the relationship. If you can spend extended periods of time together and enjoy each others' presence, that's good enough. If you have fun hobbies you share, all the better. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s by any means important that you like the same music, TV shows, or activities as long as you can spend time together while enjoying yourselves. He can go hiking with his friend Paul and you can play the violin on your own time. It's important that you have lives outside of one another. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is my opinion, and the things I thought about when considering my relationship. Interested to hear others' thoughts on the matter, too.

But many ladies with little to no sense of style always ask, **but *what* do I wear?**\n\n\nThe answer: **it depends on the type of man you want to attract** (and your personal preference which, guess what, are related to what kind of man you want!). There is more than one way to look good, and each man has his own inclinations. **What we wear is a reflection of who we are and what we think about ourselves**, and men and women alike pick up on it. \n\n\nWhen you're trying to build a wardrobe, first imagine your (realistic) dream man. Is he a wealthy businessman, who dresses like Patrick Bateman (without the personality flaws)? Is he a cowboy-type? Are you looking for a mature punk, or a middle class \"normal\" guy? Once you have figured out who you are trying to attract, try to picture the women they'd likely be seen with. \n\n\nFor example, if you are trying to attract a businessman, look toward women like Melania Trump, or for a more modest look, the Duchess of Cambridge, for fashion cues. If you're trying to go for the cowboy, look at country singers like Carrie Underwood (not in their red-carpet outfits). To entice your above-average Joe, try going for the \"hot mom\" or \"girl next door\" look (depending on age), a la Claire from Modern Family or Rory Gilmore from Gilmore Girls. \n\n\nYou get the picture. Men of any kind can appreciate beauty no matter what it's wearing, however, what is critical here is *how comfortable would they feel* approaching you, and **what does your style tell them?** Your country-boy may find Melania Trump stunning, but if he saw her on the street, he would probably either be intimidated or read her as high maintenance. **He is making an assessment of your character based on what he sees.** \n\n\nThis post came to me after an interaction with my SO the other day. I recently purchased a shade of bright red lipstick that goes very well with my complexion. I associate bright red lipstick with beautiful, stylish women and was excited, so I showed him the shade. He was unenthused. He told me that it wasn't \"my look\" and explained all the things I normally do that do work really well for me. I was disappointed, but then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't particularly like that shade of lipstick on *any* woman, because he associated it with strippers and hookers (unless they are dressed like a 50's housewife). Given that I dress like a 50's housewife only on special occasions, I conceded that it really probably wasn't for me (at least not most of the time). He said that usually I look a little \"frumpy,\" and that's always a look he's liked (his definition of frumpy is what I'd call girl-next-door). He also shares my dislike of most high-heels, and was attracted by the combat boots I was wearing when he first met me. Ultimately, he reinforced my confidence by saying I was already doing it right. \n\n\nHowever, some men *love* red lipstick. They love it when their women are always dressed to the nines, in heels, never with a hair out of place or a pantyline in sight. However, that's not me, and when I think about it, I wouldn't want a man who desires that anyway.","title":"Dressing for Mr. Right","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6tk4e9\/dressing_for_mr_right\/"}

Whether for fat loss, muscle gain, or overall health, the internet has provided easy access to various workout routines. When consuming media types, believing what you see isn\u2019t always the best idea. \n\nWomen that aggressively promote their \u201cspot reduction\u201d workouts for losing fat in specific areas of your body are lying to you. Doing \u201cChloe Ting\u2019s\u201d 2-week training will not help you lose weight. These women and influencers online sharing this information have entirely different genetics, wear waist trainers, and most of them take steroids anyways (although they won\u2019t admit to taking them). \n\nI\u2019ve seen my friends struggle to realize this in more recent years, with physiques being posted almost everywhere on social media now. It seems there is a constant reminder that we (consumers of these posts) should look exactly like them. I\u2019ve done sport-specific training and weight lifting for aesthetic reasons, and have done the beginning stages of training to compete in powerlifting. It is better to work out to achieve your personal goals than chase a body you\u2019ll never be able to have.\n\nTo achieve your goals, you have to have discipline. You can\u2019t have the results without putting the work in. It begins by simply showing up at the gym. If losing weight in your stomach and wanting a \u201ctoned tummy\u201d is your goal, ab routines from influencers will not be beneficial. You can do their workouts all you want, but they have different genetics than you, so their work outs won\u2019t give you the result you\u2019re looking for. Going into a caloric deficit, increasing the number of workouts you are doing, and the intensity of the exercises will help you reach this goal. Along with increasing the amount of cardio, you\u2019re doing. Whether at the gym or walking your dog, doing cardio and being consistent. Inconsistency will damage any progress you make and the habits you create. \n\nWhile going into a caloric deficit and doing more exercise sounds like the promotion of starving yourself to be skinny, it\u2019s far from that. Being in a caloric deficit means eating roughly 200-500 calories less than usual. You can achieve this by having less processed foods. If your goal is to \u201cbuild a dumpy\u201d or build any muscle mass, you need to increase your protein intake. Increasing your protein intake does not mean eating whatever you want or feel like. It needs to be 1 gram or 2 grams of protein per body weight. For reference, I weigh 160 lbs, and I am 5ft 10 inches. I work out 5-6x a week, and my protein intake is 200 grams of protein, 80 grams of carbs, and 145 grams of fat. You need to be strict with the food you consume to achieve your desired goals. Speaking from experience, \u201ccheating\u201d the system with your diet does nothing for you. Eating healthy also helps provide the body energy needed when working out, as well as reducing the risks of other health-related problems. \n\nIf you want to improve yourself and step toward a healthier lifestyle, take action now. Stop comparing yourself to people taking steroids and growth hormones to lean themselves out.","title":"Why Your \u201cFat Reduction\u201d Workouts Aren\u2019t Working.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/13d7gyz\/why_your_fat_reduction_workouts_arent_working\/"}

This is something basic that responsible adults do. It\u2019s made me really uneasy when I see an uptick in posters seeking advice about men they\u2019re interested in who use their mental health struggles as an excuse for poor behaviour - where they have the means to access healthcare.\n\nI am talking from a place of having experienced mental health issues myself. I will add my experiences at the end of the post because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strictly relevant but it does provide context for anyone interested. \n\nTo me, failing to prioritise physical and mental health is a red flag. It shows a lack of concern for your well-being and a disregard for the impact of your actions on those around you. It raises questions about your commitment to personal growth and self-improvement. This is especially so when mental health is used as an excuse to justify poor behaviour. \n\nIt is not your job to fix someone who refuses to do simple things like seek treatment for his condition, which will only worsen over time if left unchecked. You are not their mother. Even if you were, these men are adults, not children. If he can\u2019t take care of himself, how can he take care of you at the level you take care of him? More so, how do you expect him to help raise your future children?\n\nI appreciate some people don\u2019t have access to healthcare. I\u2019m not talking about them in the same way - but I will seriously advise that you consider that mental health issues worsen if left unchecked. Ask yourself whether that person will ever have the means to have access to healthcare and, if not, why you want to tie yourself to them. Also, ask yourself if that person _really_ doesn\u2019t have access to healthcare and whether that would change if they changed their spending habits and prioritised their health. \n\nA man who doesn\u2019t take care of his mental health doesn\u2019t prioritise his well-being. If you are at the beginning stages of a relationship and learn this, consider it a red flag because you don\u2019t want someone who doesn\u2019t prioritise living a healthy and fulfilling life with you.\n\nIf you\u2019re already in a LTR with someone amazing who develops mental health issues, stand by them as they\u2019ve shown you in the past they stand by you. If you\u2019re at the start of this process, seriously consider whether you want to go further - this person doesn\u2019t have a proven track record of showing up for you and you have no way of knowing if they ever will. This is especially, especially where they use their mental health as an excuse for their behaviour - without ever telling you how they plan to make things better and then actually actioning those plans. \n\nMy experiences fyi: \n- I\u2019m ADHD. I\u2019m lucky in that I was diagnosed young and I don\u2019t generally need medication to have success in my personal relationships and my professional career. That doesn\u2019t mean I leave my ADHD unchecked. I recognise when I have flare ups, take medication when I need it (one day every two or so months), and make sure that I communicate with my husband and boss about these struggles. I also communicate to them what I\u2019m doing to address the issue and then I take the steps to make sure my ADHD has minimal impact on those around me. \n- A few years ago, I experienced significant difficulty with work (hospitalised) and resigned during the pandemic. I had just started dating my husband (but we moved to marriage pretty fast) and we were moving to a new city, where I had no job. I was really anxious, not my best self, crying a lot - I went straight to therapy. I was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed a 6-month course of meds but I kicked the anxiety in under 2 months (and stopped meds) with a concerted effort, including having my husband help me out with job searching because I felt so overwhelmed (I got one within a couple of weeks of searching). \n\nIt is entirely possible to take care of your mental health. You don\u2019t have to settle for someone who doesn\u2019t.\n\nEdit: so many typos.

He cares that we are safe, that we are happy and that we are enjoying life, because we won't get a second shot at it. This is the serious stuff. Minor worries or inconveniences just don't register: he doesn't sweat the small stuff. If the sky is falling, he shrugs it off and keeps going. If the sky is *not* falling, then what's the problem? When we were stranded 10.000 kilometers from home in the middle of nowhere, he simply blinked and went: \"oh shit. Well, here's what we're gonna do...\" \n\n\nOh, I did this too. I did it so many times, when the sky *was* falling, because no one else would take care of things. I can do it again if I need to - heck, I'm *good* at it. I also hate it. \n\n\nApparently, he does not hate it. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. For the time being, I simply accept it as the way it is. He wants to keep me safe and happy, and that's one of his most precious gift to me: peace of mind. I don't have to look around and realize that I have to be strong because\u00a0 no one else will. I don't have to carry all this weight on my shoulders. I can just... breath. \n\n\nIs it easy? Sometimes yes, wonderfully easy. Liberating. Other times, I struggle to keep my white-knuckled grip on things that I can't control completely and that I'm not even *happy* about having to control anyway. (In-between are a hundred different levels of disagreeing, discussing, compromising, forgiving, doing each our own part, me taking charge of some things etc., of course. Submitting is not leeching, avoiding responsibilities or never taking care of difficult stuff. But that's beside the point now.) \n\n\nIt doesn't make me happy to worry, to fret, to nag, to lay awake at night thinking of all the things I need to do and all the things that could go wrong and all the things that won't get done and all the things that others could get wrong and... \n\n\n**\"Trust me.\"**\n\n\nHe wants me to be happy. \n\n\n\n**\"Trust me.\"**\n\n\nHe really can manage some fucking dressing. \n\n\n**\"Trust me.\"**\n\n\nOk, I'll go sit down and rest. \n\n\n**\"Trust me.\"**\n\n\nMy submission is his gift to me.","title":"My submission is his gift to me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/xb8ijk\/my_submission_is_his_gift_to_me\/"}

But for some reason he\u2019s extremely guarded and only keeps things superficial with me. \n\nWe\u2019ve been married for a few years now and he\u2019s the love of my life; truly, I\u2019ve never met a man who\u2019s treated me better. But when I ask him about, say, his insecurities or kinks, he answers in a way that doesn\u2019t give too much information or tells me \u201cnot to worry about it.\u201d\n\nI feel like I share everything with him, every feeling and emotion, every insecurity and vulnerable feeling; he, on the other hand, keeps me at arms length. \n\nAn example of this would be the fact that he was up for a promotion a few months ago. The company he works for conducted interviews spanning a few weeks and it came down to him and another person. He lost and I didn\u2019t find out until he took me to a dinner party and it came up in conversation. \n\nAnother example would be the fact that his grandma died. He was extremely close to his grandparents, to the point of calling them mom and dad in addition to his actual parents. But I didn\u2019t find out until a few days before the funeral because he had to go out of town. \n\nI mean seriously, how do you grieve someone so important to you in silence. He didn\u2019t even seem sad, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to guess something was going on with him because he carried himself as if nothing was wrong. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen him cry, or complain about aches and pains. Hell; if he\u2019s stressed out at work, I\u2019d be happy to help him out by taking on the bulk of chores or just being there for him yet, he never gives me the opportunity. \n\nThe crazy part is that he\u2019s so attentive to my needs; he knows when I\u2019m down, and he  knows how to pick me back up. I always feel safe to express myself around him because I know, at the end of the day, he\u2019ll do what he can to help me out.\n\nI\u2019m just confused as to why he doesn\u2019t feel the same way. \n\nI\u2019m asking for advice on how to understand him better; not leave him, so please, don\u2019t tell me to get a divorce. \n\nTLDR: My husband doesn\u2019t lean on me like I do on him, and I want to understand why.","title":"My husband doesn\u2019t trust me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/rt3h5s\/my_husband_doesnt_trust_me\/"}

We agreed that if it's a nice weather, we'll go for a walk but if not, we'll stay at his place and cook something for us and watch a movie. I know what \"watching a movie\" *usually* means, but he's really respectful, a bit shy (all I got at the end of the last date was a kiss on the forehead) and I know he doesn't want to rush anything.\n\nThe thing is, I'd like to come to his apartment and just chill but I'm not ready to sleep with him.

Should I even tell him through text or should I wait to tell him in person? Or should I go without saying anything about this and *if* he tries to take my clothes off, just stop him then?

My relationship fits almost perfectly with RPW ideas already (I feel lucky regarding this) but I've gotten some good tips from here.\n\nOne thing I've realized recently is that I need to dress for my husband, not other women. I should take cues from what he likes, not what my friends or FFA are suggesting.\n\nMy husband loves all sorts of things that are \"no-nos\" among other women. He likes it when I wear strong eyeshadow *and* a strong lip sometimes. He likes it when I sometimes wear a bra that is not well fitting according to ABraThatFits (dat butt cleavage). And he sure as hell doesn't give a fuck about designer brands. A feminine purse from Target is as attractive (if not more) to him than a Chanel bag. He likes it when I wear a belt to emphasize my waist even though according to FFA, that's *so* out of style. He *doesn't* like twee things that show up there all the time, like cat bags and such. Most men tend to like classic styles more, especially once you're already married. He *loves* it when I wear leggings as pants. He likes it when I do my nails, but doesn't really give a shit about fancy designs or ~holo~. Red is ideal.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Overall, I would say that you should dress in a way that *men* like, not women. Realizing this has really improved our marriage even more.

I had an interesting interaction with a user today. He was upset because he felt that the direction of this sub has been lost and that we have essentially devolved into a sub that teaches old sluts how to reel in a BB. This lead me to ask the question, *who is Red Pill for?* \n\nRed Pill is for women who have realized that the liberal, feminist agenda that we are indoctrinated with all of our lives is not making them happy. It is for the ladies who think, \"there must be a better way to interact with my SO, there has to be another dynamic than this current one that isn't working.\" \n\nIt's for the 18 year old virgin who's never had a serious boyfriend. But, and this seems to be where this particular fellow had a problem, it's also for the 28 year old who realizes she wasted her youth on the wrong priorities and is looking for help to fix them. It's for the 35 year old divorced mother who is looking to fix the problems and ideologies she has been using and find a good man. \n\nSure, some men may think that some ladies are just trying to have their cake and eat it too, but to that I say, how can you tell the difference between one women who is genuinely trying to better herself and the one who is doing it to be manipulative? You can't, so err on the side of caution and help everyone. \n\nYes, some guys are going to be turned off by your age, your children, your divorce history, your party girl past. That's a natural consequence of life. Did you know a better way at the time? The answer doesn't matter because it doesn't effect the outcome. The point is, you're here *now*. You're looking to fix things *now*. \n\nWe all have a past and while some may condemn you for it, others won't. Those are the men you are bettering yourself for. Some men who are angry or bitter and come here may say they're all betas or they're low quality men but if you see quality in this man, who is some stranger on the Internet to tell you you're wrong? \n\nLadies, we are in a much better position than or feminist counterparts, no matter what age you swallow the pill. I'm not encouraging a \"team woman\" attitude and I'm certainly not encouraging the women looking to glean what they can from the sub for their own manipulative game. \n\nWhen I look at posts for advice or field reports and see some posters condemning those of us who have the courage to open up about our past mistakes, it really irritates me. Red pill is about seeing reality for what it is and using it to live your life the best way you can. You can't un-ride the CC and you can't go back in time to hunt for a husband at 23. Start where you're at now. The journey is still worthwhile. Don't let the occasional bitter poster bring you down. \n\nI truly believe in this journey, I know it has changed my life and marriage for the absolute better. I certainly wish I had found it earlier in my 20's than I did, but the point is, I did indeed find the Red Pill. This journey, this mind set, this lifestyle, this praxeology, is a truly indispensable thing to integrate into your life and a cause I very strongly believe in.

Yesterday, it was his grandma\u2019s birthday and he had all the family round at his place and invited me to join them in celebrating. \n\nThis was the first time I\u2019d be meeting his family all at once so I was quite nervous but knew it was going to be a big step for our relationship. I brought flowers along and some little table treats so I wouldn\u2019t come empty handed. Soon after I arrived, the rest of his family arrived and we were all sitting in the front room and he introduced me to them just by my name. \n\nAs we were sitting in the front room, I\u2019m sitting next to him and he takes out his phone and it opens up to him being on the dating app Hinge and I can see it was in the middle of a conversation where he had liked the girls picture. He quickly swipes off it but I tell him that I saw that. He then quickly puts his arm around me and tries to pull me in closer to him. He asks me if I want us to go and talk about it and I just take my drink and my bag upstairs to his room and he follows behind me. I can\u2019t remember all of what he said but I know he didn\u2019t say sorry to me and he just had a light-hearted playful attitude, he just repeated that I looked really nice tonight and he just wants us to enjoy the night. I said I felt like leaving but he said he didn\u2019t want me to leave, it wasn\u2019t an option and he wanted to introduce me to the rest of his family. I said what\u2019s the point because he\u2019s just introducing me by name anyway so it\u2019s not even clear who I am. He said he thought it was obvious but he said it\u2019s fine he\u2019ll start introducing me as his girlfriend. I told him not to, especially because of what had just happened but for the rest of the night he started loudly introducing me as his girlfriend.\n\nI was quite upset so I go to the bathroom to call my mum crying to tell her what happened. She tries to think through with me about what the right thing is to do and she suggests that if I'll be too upset, it\u2019s probably best to hand the flowers to the grandma then make a quiet and polite early exit. I didn\u2019t want to be visibly upset in front of everyone especially it being their first time meeting me but didn't know how to leave without making a scene and everyone asking questions so I decided to stay and had some friendly conversation with his sisters and other family members.\n\nTo cut a super long story short, I ended up staying the full duration of the party and helped clear up at the end of the night. I didn\u2019t want to sit next to him in the kitchen where we were all eating but I thought it would look bad so I asked him what food he wanted and served him and myself a plate and sat next to him. His family were really warm and welcoming honestly so lovely. As they were leaving and we said our goodbyes they told me they hoped to see me again. I took all the belongings I had at his place and he dropped me home. We spoke in the car for a little bit, I won\u2019t go into that detail but I abruptly left the conversation and said goodbye. I did send a little goodnight message like I usually do but this time without all the hearts. He responded similarly.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for advice but I did want to share this. I feel really disheartened by it all because this issue had come up before and I thought we had moved past it but now we\u2019re here again. I already don\u2019t have the highest self-esteem, I\u2019m quite insecure and self-conscious so it\u2019s quite upsetting for me. I\u2019m proud of myself that I was able to sit through a difficult situation because usually I go into flight mode. At dinner he was talking about a trip he wanted to book for us in the summer and I would love to go because I do enjoy his company and I've had a lot of new experiences with him. He said he\u2019s introduced me to his family and I\u2019m the one here with him so I\u2019m more important than the girls he\u2019s talking to. He really put in so much effort into my birthday just 2 weeks ago and made it really special for me. I am a bit confused about what to do. I feel scared about having to start again and find someone else but I also do feel scared about being with someone who\u2019s not satisfied with me and wants to talk to other people and what effect that could have on me down the road.\n\n**TL;DR The guy I\u2019ve been dating for 9 months just introduced to me to his family for the first time yesterday during his grandmothers birthday. Whilst we were there I saw he had been talking to a girl on a dating app when he opened up his phone. I stayed for the duration of the party and he dropped me home. Little bit confused about where to go from here.

But if you could keep it tranquilized, that\u2019s close enough for government work[.](https:\/\/goo.gl\/images\/GkpAci)\u201d** - u\/durtyknees\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe\u2019ve talked in the past about the problem with [self-esteem](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8ww90e\/the_cult_of_selfesteem\/), a feel good concept not to be confused with [self-respect]( http:\/\/archive.is\/d7c76). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> To esteem anything is to evaluate it positively and hold it in high regard, but evaluation gets us into trouble because while we sometimes win, we also sometimes lose. To respect something, on the other hand, is to accept it\u2026The person with self-respect simply likes her- or himself. This self-respect is not contingent on success because there are always failures to contend with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSelf esteem, always fashionable because insecurity sells us stuff, is a potent stimulant for your hamster. Throw social media into the mix add a dash of salt and let the comparisons and self-loathing begin. We can spiral our hamster out of control comparing ourselves to others, wondering why *she* has something better, why that other man *would never do* what our SO just did.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first step to a healthy and sedated hamster is *liking yourself*.  This is self respect. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cliking yourself in comparison to others.\u201d Rather, it\u2019s a straight up appreciation for your own life and acceptance of where you are currently in the world. \n\n***\n\n###**How do I learn to like myself**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Take an inventory of your life and thoughtfully acknowledge the good and the bad. Everyone has bad and there is no reason not to look it squarely in the face. Be actively aware of the good. Face the parts you don\u2019t like and make a plan to change them. Hiding from the truth won\u2019t make you feel good about yourself. \n\n* Similarly, take some initiative to achieve goals for yourself. Earn your own respect!\n\n* Get off social media. Even though you know that it\u2019s highly curated, your brain still looks at what others have and makes comparisons. \n\n* Understand and accept that life has trade offs and every person makes their own.  Nothing is perfect and if you focus on what is bad in a situation, you won't be able to be happy. A 'perfect' life is one where the benefits outweigh the costs in your eyes. \n\n* Don\u2019t spend too much time in echo chambers. As humans we are inclined towards group think and comparisons. By spending time around all sorts of people, you have a more realistic view of the world and yourself. Hamsters thrive in echo chambers. \n\n***\n\n###**Ok, I like myself, now what?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe hamster\u2019s official titles is The Rationalization Hamster^TM.  Mine\u2019s name is Joey. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour hamster comes out to play in response to feelings. As you try to identify the cause of the feelings, the hamster gets in his ball and starts to run. He can go all over the place, sometimes getting you even farther away from the truth and deeper in negative emotion territory than you were when you started. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou may not stop the hamster (he\u2019s your response to feelings) but it only take a little bit of effort to turn the hamster to your advantage. All this really means is assuring yourself of what you already know. \nLearn to identify your feelings. Not what they mean, just what they are. An easy way to start: if you are reading RPW and have a bad feeling over something you read \u2013 don\u2019t try to put a \u201cwhy\u201d onto it, just stop and recognize the feeling as \u201cI don\u2019t like this\u201d. Eventually you will put the why to it, but the pause gives you a moment to acknowledge and feel your feelings. We\u2019re not trying to turn them off, just delay the rationalizations about why you feel them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*As an aside to this, I strongly recommend tracking your own cycle and symptoms. I cannot tell you how often my BFF will get upset at her husband and 24 hours later tell me that she got her period. It\u2019s incredibly valuable information to have about yourself.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter this pause, you feed your hamster the information you want it to have. This is where *liking yourself* comes in. If you feel a pang of jealousy, feed your hamster: \u201che picked me, I\u2019m pretty, we are well matched, he didn\u2019t pick her, *I am in control because I can up my game if I need to*\u201d.  It\u2019s important that you believe all those things, which is why we started with self respect. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHamster sedation can take varying amounts of time and require additional tactics. While we promote [bringing your captain your problems]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4i8ukh\/bring_your_captain_your_problem_not_your_solution\/) this is best done when your head is cool. Many women collect stress like it\u2019s dirty laundry and we have a tendency to dump the whole load on any person who is kind enough to listen and offer comfort. Our men may *want* to help us through a spin cycle or two but he will tire of it quickly. If you find that you need to vent, start by journaling it out. Rereading the emotional dump once you have cooled off will help you to better understand how your hamster works. It will also serve as a reminder of the crazy you *don\u2019t* want to dump on your man every time. Pets can also make a great captive audience if you are someone who needs to vocalize your feelings to calm down. If your cats start fleeing whenever they see you, consider a nice inanimate teddy bear instead. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLastly, there will be times when you find it impossible to sedate the hamster on your own. This is where it\u2019s important that you have solid friends and not an echo chamber. Many women believe that you shouldn\u2019t talk about your relationship with anyone else. There is wisdom in this tactic because other women *can* pull you down to boost themselves up. However, having a few friends who will support you and be honest can be invaluable. You need a woman who you can trust to say: \u201cbut he *adores you* why are you jealous\u201d because sometimes the hamster needs an outsider to inject the sedatives.  It should be someone who shares your values and either cares about your husband or doesn't know your husband (*if there is no one in your life who shares your values make private friends through RPW*). Without a real set of eyes (so to speak) you can go too far in one direction *or the other*.\n\n","title":"Taming the Hamster","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9x2c4u\/taming_the_hamster\/"}

I need to work part time to help make ends meet and provide breathing room in our budget. I work in healthcare and I'm per diem which means I set the hours I want to work, when, how many, what day, etc. Its a sweet deal, I work at a skilled nursing facility so there's always tons of hours available and I just get to pick and choose what I want. My husband works regular office hours and I'm second shift so I can stay home with the baby (9 months old today!!) and that way he isn't in daycare. However if I work 3 nights a week, I see less of my husband. Its a trade off. This week, I decided to try and work two \"doubles (aka 16 hour shifts) to get all my hours into 2 days. So I worked from 3p Monday afternoon until 7am Tuesday morning and Thursday night to Friday morning. I nap when the baby naps and its definitely tolerable. \n\n\n LB (Little Boy) Dunham is on a feeding schedule like most babies his age. He's getting pretty good at sleeping through the night. Before I left for work on Monday I explained the schedule and went to work. Well they slept through a feeding and got it three hours late so LB woke me up after only an hour of sleep. I talked to Mr. Dunham again, told him what happened and explained the importance of the schedule. Well the same thing happened again this morning. This time I was pissed. \n*Why is it that I can keep the schedule and he can't? I feed the baby every single night, he can't do it while I'm at work?! I have to work AND take care of the house! Doesn't he get how tired I am?!*\n And I could have yelled all these things at him. I'd definitely have a right to. I think every woman here that has a child completely understands my anger. I had worked *sixteen* hours and then had to come home, barely fall asleep only to be woken up by a hungry baby who was very happy to see me. \n\n\n \n Instead, I erased the nasty text message I was planning on sending him and instead said, \"LB tells me you didn't feed him this morning.\" To which he apologized and said he totally forgot, he had set an alarm but it didn't go off for whatever reason. I didn't feel I could say anything nice, so I didn't say anything else about it. Tonight when he got home he apologized again and promised he'd get it right for next week. \n\n The whole point of this FR is that there is no grand closure to this story. I don't work again until next Monday. The point is that even though it should have been a simple task and he screwed up twice and really inconvenienced me is that I still love him and he's still my husband. We all make mistakes, we all screw up. I had an expectation that he would do something and he failed, twice. But that doesn't make him a failure and it doesn't make him incompetent. Just because my husband makes mistakes doesn't mean he isn't trustworthy. I could have raked him over the coals and I'm pretty sure he expected it, but I value the harmony in our marriage more than being right and making sure he knows it. Consequently, he told me the fact that I didn't yell made him feel worse, especially when he walked in the door tonight and saw how exhausted I looked. \n\n There isn't always a happy, rosy ending. Sometimes our husbands fail and just suck at doing things. Be RPW anyway. Its not always easy or always fair or always rewarding but that's life my dears. I'll make up the sleep tonight, but the damage my harsh words could have done to our relationship and his confidence as my captain could have lasted for far longer than that. \n\nTreasure your husband, treasure your marriage. \n\n\n ~Sadie","title":"FR: My Husband F***ed Up Today...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6aumug\/fr_my_husband_fed_up_today\/"}

They have a library full of classics and a dedicated theater room. They live in area with sprawling gardens and nature, yet are only an hour away from a major city.\n\nThese men are willing to kill if it means protecting you. Their bodies are toned and rugged, capable of besting any man, woman, or any other being that gets in his way; however, he is skilled a diplomat capable of eloquently resolving conflicts without resorting to violence.\n\nThese men also enjoy giving oral.\n\n**These men do not exist.** However, a good goal to have is to think of the man you are in a relationship with as your prince charming. If you are honestly able to convince yourself of this, then you really do love him.\n\n###II. The Marriageable Men.\n\nThese men have just the right amount of alpha and beta traits. They can lead, they are responsible, they know how to manage finances, they know how to manage *you,* they take the relationship seriously, and they are not afraid of commitment. While not necessarily possessing the genetics of the roman gods, these men are physically attractive. In addition, they have amicable personalities and are not a burden for you to put up with.\n\nYou feel at ease with these men. They do not *mess up*; they act in such a manner that you do not resent them for the actions they take. You find it easy to love these men because they are loveable. They are like prince charmings in some ways: some are rich, some are tall, some have a pssion for science, others a passion for the arts. The difference is they have, one, two, three, or more flaws, major and\/or minor, that you are able to overlook and forgive.\n\nThese men do not pester you for sex all the time \u2026 because they keep you attracted so the chemistry does not fade. You **want** to sleep with this man. They do not laugh at your mistakes, yet they maintain your attraction towards them by making you feel like a woman. These men are just the right mix of alpha fucks\u2014as they are physically attractive and possess important alpha traits\u2014and beta bucks\u2014because they are caring and are financially able to provide.\n\nGetting a marriageable man is not difficult, [but it does require work on your part.](\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2qt5th\/tips_for_a_new_rpw_i_read_the_sidebar_but_i_still\/cn9d9yj).\n\n###III. The Alpha Fucks \n\nThese men are attractive, or as you women would say, \u201ccute.\u201d They are confident, attractive, and tall. You notice them while you do your grocery shopping, when you are at the gym, and when you are simply walking outside. \n\nBut why would you want a relationship with these men? Some of them are broke. Others have just too much alpha\u2014they can be confident and assertive, but they do not care that your aunt just died. They do not have the time nor energy to listen to your problems. Chances are, to them, you are a plate.\n\nThey are not ideal relationship options, although highly dominant women will feel feminine with alpha fucks. It is possible for a strong alpha fucks\/weak beta bucks man to be relationship material for high dominance women if he does not fail any important requirement for being in a relationship with.\n\n### IV. The Beta Oribters. \n\nThese are the men you friendzone. You know your friends that are just so gosh darn nice? The same ones you just cannot help but feel like are not relationship material? These are them. \n\nBeta orbiters try to win a woman through their wallet, by listening to all of women\u2019s problems, by being an emotional tampon, and by always being there for women. But those things turn women off. \n\nBeta orbiters are too needy. They lack confidence. Even if you step back and let the man be a man and lead, he will not fare well. You almost feel like a mother when it comes to these men because they are not self-assured and seek guidance from you. You dominated them, grow to resent them, and feel contempt toward them. They are emasculated and do not know how to be masculine. They are not relationship material because you do not feel a shred of attraction towards them.\n\n###V. The Invisible Men \n\nThese men are about 80% of the male population to you (give or take 5%). They are not attractive. They are short. They have no ambition in life. They do not know how to treat a lady with respect and equality, and they certainly do not know how to make a woman feel like a woman in bed by acting dominant  and treating her submissively.\n\nThese men are a mix of betas and omegas. The betas here, as opposed to the beta orbiters in strata four are not even on your radar. You have never met them, you do not even know these guys\u2019 names. You appreciate (or do you?) the men at the cash register, the garbagemen, the boilermakers, the coal miners, and the construction workers. But none of them are relationship material. Some do not make enough money. Others do not want a family. Others just are not attractive enough. Others are attractive, but they do not want to support your dreams of becoming a painter. Some men want to, but they do not want to help pay for your student loans. All in all, these men are too problematic.\n\nThe omegas are on a whole other level. Not only are they short, fat, and unattractive, these men are **really invisible to you.** Why? Because they do not even bother with women. They go play video games all day. They cannot for the life of them attract a woman. They go in front of a woman and stutter and twiddle their thumbs and do their best to muster \u201cD-d-do y-you want, uh, um, to um l-like go on a d-d-d-date with me\u201d and the poor woman cannot help but feel her vagina dry up like the Sahara Desert.\n\n***\n\nMy advice to women in relationships is that they should try to think of the man they are in a relationship with as their prince charming. Of course it is not true, but doing this will help limit hypergamic tendencies. For single women, of course you should look to LTR and\/or marry quality men. Do not settle, at least not for the sake of settling. Improve your SMV and MMV so you can get a guy in the second strata. \n\n**TL;DR** Prince charming doesn't exist, marriageable are almost perfect but have flaws, alpha fucks can be unstable and have trouble committing, beta orbiters aren't your first choice, and invisible men are completely unattractive.

Understands that physical appearance and her looks are what attracts men\u2019s sexual interest. She stays in shape and while every waking minute she may not be dressed to the nines, neither does she get mistaken for a slob. She \u201clooks good for [insert age]\u201d\n\n2.  Understands that all her skills, effort, kindness, intelligence and \u201cinner beauty\u201d et al, is what creates relationship comfort and makes her someone capable of having a functional relationship with.\n\n3.  Understands that what she does with her vagina always has some sort of consequence.\n\n4. Understands that there is a sexual marketplace, and that women have an earlier peak of sexual desirability than men do. That the point (1) stuff comes very easily to young women, and that the point (2) and (3) stuff pays off over the longer term.\n\n5.  Understands that men are the gatekeepers of commitment and that committed men place extreme value on sexual loyalty.\n\n6.  Doesn\u2019t need a man to save her from her own folly. Will not tolerate a relationship with a man that requires her to save him from his folly.\n\n7.  Is aware of her own sexuality and understands what in a man attracts her and turns her on. Namely hypergamy, Alpha Traits, why she may Fitness Test and so on.\n\n8.  Can delay gratification. Can pass on someone or something that is fun for now, but painful later on.\n\n9. Can articulate things that she did wrong in prior relationships. Even if the guy was clearly the greater cause of relationship failure, she can acknowledge things she could have done better, or differently. She can think consciously about her relationships, rather than simply follow her emotions from moment to moment. Has a learning curve.\n\n10.  Understands that relationships are not static, that effort and intention to maintain them is an ongoing requirement. That while she can reasonably expect the man to take the lead, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the sled dog and she can curl up and take a nap on the sleigh.\n\n11. Expresses genuine relationship discontent, clearly and directly, allowing time to correct the relationship issue. Does not complain to everyone else but her husband, does not act out instead of addressing problems, does not plan and\/or execute an exit strategy before stating her discontent.\n\n12. Lets go of resentment for relationship issues that are now resolved.\n\n13. Understands that divorce sucks and is more akin to getting treatment for cancer than having cosmetic surgery.\n\n14. Likes men in a general sense for who they are and what they do, rather than detesting all men in general and making an exception for the tiny few in her nuclear family.\n\n15. Understands the risks both men and women take in having serious relationships, and is willing to negotiate ways to verify trustworthiness in each other. Sees doing this as evidence of true commitment rather than an insulting invasion of privacy.\n\n16.  With her chosen partner, is deeply and passionately sexual.\n\n17.  Is aware of her own personal kink and can communicate her sexual desires. Takes responsibility for receiving her own sexual pleasure.\n\n18.  Has a sense of humor.\n\n19.  Respects the boundaries of other peoples relationships and doesn\u2019t attempt to mate poach.\n\n20.  Doesn\u2019t keep the Red Pill a secret from those that need it.","title":"What Exactly Is A Red Pill Woman?--Good Stuff from Athol Kay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2p83dt\/what_exactly_is_a_red_pill_womangood_stuff_from\/"}

This week we are starting with the idea of respect and it's importance in a relationship. That will be a lead in to discuss submission later in the week.\n\nThere are many ideas that make up RPW but respect and submission are two of the big ones. Ask questions, discuss and digest.\n\nThis post shows us why and how submissive behavior can be used to our advantage so we can achieve what we want in your love lives.\n\n*****\n\n##Submissive Behaviour as Strategy by u\/Whisper\n\nAny woman with a triple digit IQ who devotes an hour or so to scanning the main redpill subreddit will quickly realize a few things: \n\n* TRP deliberately cultivates a harsh and critical tone towards women in general. \n* TRP deliberately teaches dealing with women in a ruthless and self-interested fashion. \n* These are not the result of a raw outpouring of uncontrolled anger, but instead a deliberate instructional choice by TRP's leading voices. \n\nWhile the men of TRP have no need for women to understand the \"why\" of this (TRP tactics work regardless), it is very for valuable *for women* to understand why this is so... it yields insight into their own best strategy.\n\nThe basic method of TRP is founded on the realization that mating between men and women is governed by the balance between two corresponding instincts: \n\n* Women instinctively submit to, defer to, and obey men. \n* Men instinctively protect and care for women. \n* Each of these instincts, when expressed proportionally, tends to provoke the corresponding response in the other. \n\nWhen these two instincts are both strongly expressed, a win-win interaction inevitably takes place... the woman is not brutalized or casually discarded despite her complete vulnerability, because the man's own instinct to protect and care for her restrains him, and the man is not exploited and vampirically sucked dry, because of the woman's instinct to defer to him and place his desires ahead of her own. \n\nHowever, these instincts are not always expressed in balance. A woman who is submissive to a man who feels no urge to take care of her, or a man who is protective of a woman who does not submit to him, will end up being harmed. \n\nWhen we understand this, we can see the reasoning behind the \"tone\" of TRP. It is a deliberate tactic for training men to suppress their protective instinct, necessitated by an environment full of women who are not submissive. \n\nIt is from here that we can realize a profound tactical implication for women who understand this. **If the teachers of TRP must work as hard as they do to suppress male protectiveness even of women who are not submissive, how hard can it be for a woman who IS to activate that same instinct?**\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is why RPW teaches submissive behaviour. It has nothing to do with tradition. It is not a religious law, or a moral obligation. It is simply *the best move* for dealing with any man who isn't severely damaged (how to identify those is a subject for another day). This is why \"drawing boundaries\" with your man, or \"negotiating\" with him \"from a position of strength\" may *sound* safe, but is a very bad idea. It is the decision to engage in conflict with the sex that is built for conflict, while in that very act sacrificing an incredibly potent advocate who *lives inside his own head*, past all his defenses. \n\nThe basis of any strong RPW strategy for navigating the risks of the sexual marketplace involves cultivating the ability to evoke this instinct in men. \n\nThis does not simply begin and end with deference or obedience, but rather consists of a whole host of behaviours calculated to draw the protective instinct out. It is, however, the *willingness* to behave in a submissive fashion to begin with that allows a woman to access, learn, and experiment with such strategies.","title":"Back to Basics September: Submissive Behavior as Strategy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/prgjnb\/back_to_basics_september_submissive_behavior_as\/"}

I never thought that was an issue for him, nor did he express that the loose skin is bothering him. Its not the tlc special kinda skin not even close just like a post baby bod. I workout with heavy weights every other day and keep a strict diet, I am by no means lazy, I am aware of the problem and im trying to keep this body as tight as i possibly can without surgery since i still havent given birth and a tummy tuck is highly recommended after having children. i do not intend on being, staying or looking fat. \n\nSo 2 weeks ago while I was putting on a summerdress I bought I told him how nice it shapes me, he agreed and said \"hides your flab too\". It was like a punch in the gut. Flab? I didn't comment further and was just extremely hurt for the rest of the evening. I made him his dinner and he continued to work as I sulked in my office. i pinched all my flabby parts and was so disgusted with myself. He continued making these comments the days following.\n\nI confronted him and asked him why he's being so destructive about my appearance, knowing that i'm putting my all into it. He said he appreciates the work and he doesn't mean anything bad. Im just \"objectively not the type of girl he would've imagined himself with\" naming some instagram models like amanda cerny instead.\n\nAll of this coming from him has made me so depressed, i go to the gym just to avoid him, and i feel so unhappy with myself. Im a pretty woman, objectively good looking people ask me out whenever i go workout or shopping. i feel deeply hurt by my partner that i just can't get myself to sleep with him anymore, i feel like i resent him, for giving me a marriage where I feel disgusting while i'm very certain i couldve had one where my partner is \"all over me\". i wish he had vocalized on his lack of attraction for my body before, i wouldve never considered marrying him then. We were very active anyway but especially while trying for a baby we were having sex every day or bjs when i'm on my period.

I am mid 20's, he is late 20's. \n\n\n\nThis is all weighing on me and I could really use the wisdom of this beautiful community. \n\n\nIt seems so petty as I write it out, but it feels like the hurt sort of goes deeper than just the one comment? Long story short, the other night at a function he was asked (jokingly) who he thought was smarter and he said himself. I turned around and said, \"oh really you think it is that obvious?\" Kind of expecting him to play it off and say something like \"Oh well it's hard to measure something like that\", but he just said yes, in what I interpreted as a 'it is so undeniable that it was crazy that you asked the question' voice. \n\n\n\nI said \"ouch!\" and just let it go because we had company. But I brought it up later, and said that he hurt my feelings. For reference, we are both in very different fields, I am in an integrated philosophy\/ technology and neuroscience degree, and he is in engineering. He said he was sorry he hurt my feelings, but basically that he stands by it. He also admitted that he has an ego problem when it comes to intelligence.\n\n\n\nI guess the way that I (previously) saw our relationship was the same way that I see the relationship between men and women. We both excel where the other does not, and bring our different strengths to the relationship, building each other up. I am a good writer and trained in research and critical thinking, he is good at math and design. He is not a good writer or reader, and I have never excelled at math. I am the person that our friends go-to for emotional advice\/ support, he is the one they go to when they need a good time. I really saw us as two opposite but equal dynamic forces.\n\n\n\nI felt a lot of things. I feel discredited because my field is more \"artsy\" and my skills are more \"feminine\", that he does not see the value of what I do and what I am good at. \n\n\n\nA few days later I was at a networking event talking with one of the higher-ups in my circle (Paul), and I made a comment about struggling with a concept that he easily mastered and that he was smarter than me. And he stopped the conversation and very clearly said \"No, that is not the case at all! It really comes down to practice and experience in the field\" and I almost burst into tears because how is it that someone who I work with builds me up more than my partner does??? \n\n\n\nIt's not so much that he is or isn't smarter than me. I don't really think that matters. And as someone who literally studies intelligence, I have to say that it is almost impossible to quantify someone's intelligence because there are so many factors. \n\n\n\nI think the things that I am having trouble with are: If he actually thinks he is that superior to me, will he listen to my inputs? I don't want to be with someone who makes me feel inferior to them. There have been times where I am hard on myself, just telling myself to suck it up and not be sad about the truth, but I don't really know if I want to be with someone who doesn't think the world of me, and build me up ESPECIALLY in front of our friends. \n\n\n\nI also feel like I am no longer comfortable being totally vulnerable with him, because when I admit my faults (like struggling with math) he will see me as less than him. I don't want to be with someone who makes me feel stupider than him, EVEN if it is the case that he is smarter. \n\n\nAm I crazy? Am I blowing this out of proportion? (yes)... What can I do? He is wonderful in so many other ways, but I feel myself becoming more sensitive and insecure to his passing comments. Yes to a HUGE extent, I should work on my own self-worth, and not caring what others think, but I shouldn't have to work on my self worth in order to feel good about myself in my relationship! I should feel good in the relationship, shouldn't I?\n\n\nAny help or support would be greatly appreciated. You are all the best. Thank you.\n\n\nEDIT:\nHi! We had a big talk last night, and we agreed that it was really a difference in our definition of intelligence. I asked him what he defines intelligence as, and he said \"memory and decision making\". I define it as \"the ability to learn and apply information to solve problems\". So very broad vs very narrow definitions. It's funny because he actually has an awful memory sometimes. But he is a really good decision-maker. I told him that it is okay that he values his STEM skills more than my skills, (thank you  \/u\/Kara__El ) because that is what he is passionate about and involved in. He said that it still wasn't okay that he disrespected me, especially in front of people.\n\n We talked about the small biting comments, ( \/u\/Sailoress7 ) he says that his family (who he adores and treats amazingly) communicates that way, and that our ability to be snarky to one another is a part of the relationship that he truly loves and appreciates. He says that sometimes he will go over the line, but every time he remembers that and works to not do it (in that way, at least) again. He does for sure censor his humour around me especially when I am upset or sensitive. I'm going to follow his lead on this. Especially because when I am not feeling sensitive, I love that jokey bitey sort of loving insulty part of our relationship, as long as it is based on the solid ground of a loving and respectful relationship. My dad is the same way with me, and I really do appreciate the back and forth nature of that relationship as well. \n\n\nWe talked about compliments and affirmations, which I have been feeling lacking since his comment (because my feelings are hurt) and we talked about my need for words of affirmation. Not my primary love language, but it is really up there. He says he really tries not to just compliment my body or looks, but other things too, and he tries to have novel complements, not just 'you're pretty\", so I did feel bad that I haven't noticed and appreciated it. \n\nAnyways, huge thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to offer advice and sympathy. I really appreciate each and every one of you who took the time to comment.","title":"He told me that he's more intelligent than me and my feelings are hurt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/f0mj2s\/he_told_me_that_hes_more_intelligent_than_me_and\/"}

But, because of the rise of feminism, growing up my goals were to become a career woman, making it on my own and living a 50\/50 lifestyle with my soulmate.\n\nI\u2019ve been long term relationships since I was 16 (now 22) and all of them with average and poor men, always splitting the bill and assuring them that I wasn\u2019t in it for the money.  I never once used the amount a man makes as a decider in whether I would date him or not. Until now.  \n\nAfter my last boyfriend, I stayed single for the longest time I\u2019ve ever been (1yr) because I needed to find myself. I was working in the corporate world in an office full of deeply unhappy unmarried ladies in their 30s and 40s who were working in positions I dreamed of having as a child.  I realized there is no joy in this future, and that was exactly where I was headed if I kept up my feminist mindset.  This terrified me to my core.  \n\nIt dawned upon me that one of my biggest strengths and source of joy in life was the ability to keep a man happy, and serve him, and take care of him just as a traditional woman does.   I realized that I could have a much bigger and better impact on the world by making a powerful mans life easier, so he could spend more time focusing on improving the world, than I would if I were alone working in corporate middle management following my so called \u201cchildhood dreams.\u201d \n\nEveryone talks about kings, and powerful men and their amazing accomplishments, but I now wonder, how much of their success could be attributed to their amazing wives and their unwavering support.  Why rich? Because that is what the world runs on, more money equals more influence, and more chance to influence a man to do good and be better.  Now, finally at 22, I feel I\u2019ve found a main goal in life, to support the vision of a powerful rich man, make sacrifices and give him my love, time, energy and femininity.  \n\nBut now that I\u2019ve found a goal to pursue, how can I go about finding a man like this? Are there any other women who have the mentality that I do, and have found success?  Is there a way to convey my goals without being shamed by men and women alike? \n\nAll the women I know think that it\u2019s so superficial and in my experience, one of the most upsetting things a man can hear is that a woman exclusively wants a rich man.  But I don\u2019t feel like my decision for one is out of greediness for myself or to take his money.  I believe that there is a distinct difference between being a gold digger, and wanting to be a partner to a rich and powerful man to support an honourable vision and raise our children to live a life better than my own.","title":"Bagging a Rich Man","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/d7zy02\/bagging_a_rich_man\/"}

Some have attributed this to the productive effort of males in contrast to the distributive focus of females throughout our evolved history \u2013 men have found food and produced shelter, and women have made sure each member of the family had enough to eat. As our communities have grown beyond the family, this responsibility has expanded, and women have historically taken up the role of caring for the children of others, the elderly, the disabled, and the weak. \n\nI often experience this urge myself, which has drawn me to nursing, and draws me to offer food to men on the street. As a feminine woman, my primary instinct and temperament should reasonably draw me to socialism, as it has done so many women and effeminate men. Not only do we feel the need to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves, but we also appreciate the feeling of security that comes from knowing we will be taken care of. It takes courage to advocate for limited government, in which masculinity thrives with increased responsibility and independence, but comes at a high cost if one should fail.\n\nBut I am a libertarian conservative.  \n\nThe Conservative Woman. A contradiction? A paradox? And why does it seem that some of the most traditionally conservative women are also the most feminine, and value these traits more than their counterparts on the left? (Shout out, RPW).  \n\nWithin myself, I have discovered many reasons for this incongruence between my temperament and my political ideology, including the discovery through my work that to truly help someone means to support their independence and autonomy above all else, one of the first indications to me of the faults of welfare and similar supportive institutions. But there must be more to it.\n\nWhat I have considered recently is that The Conservative Woman is still feminine in nature, but holds a high regard for masculinity as her natural counterbalance, retaining profound respect and admiration for men and their place in both the home and in society as a whole. \n\nModern women have \u201cliberated\u201d themselves from men, but in doing so, they have created within themselves a storm of insecurity and dissatisfaction with the independence they so desired. They want to be single mothers or have powerful careers, but find that without men, they turn to the state for security. However, they have failed to recognize that distribution without adequate production is impossible \u2013 or, that a society with socialist safety nets without the foundation of a strong capitalistic economy can only continue for so long before total collapse. \n\nThe future cannot be only female. It would end disastrously. \n\nThe Conservative Woman recognizes that security should be found in a home and a husband, not the state. The Conservative Woman recognizes that children need a father as much as they need a mother. The Conservative Woman trusts that masculine traits of competitiveness, dominance, and rational self-interest are positive traits and produce value in society and for the family. The Conservative Woman takes care of her family, but raises her children to someday take care of themselves.\n\nThe Conservative Woman does not feel a need to become masculine and independent, and allows herself to embrace her femininity and dependence on her husband, as he exercises his natural right to self-determination while bearing the weight of the responsibility that comes along with it. And personally, I think that is beautiful. ","title":"The Conservative Woman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9rd38y\/the_conservative_woman\/"}

He was very happy with all I'd done for the company, and wanted me to meet his wife and kids. Of course, I was happy to do so. As such, one day his wife came to help us run operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I've always been a fan of the saying \"Women are born, men are made\". I'd be lying if I said I didn't think it came from a slight animus I carry towards women, but I digress. Put simply, women are born with and grow naturally what men seek(youth, fertility, looks), where as men earn what women seek(wealth, confidence, competence). This was an especially raw deal for women who were dealt a bad hand biologically speaking, and there is relatively little to do besides lose weight, wear makeup and adjust the wardrobe. Or so I thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou see, my partner's wife was by no means a pretty woman. Speaking frankly, her looks probably ranked in the bottom 25%, but her figure was not bad, you could tell she was fit. Yet, somehow by then end of our day working together, I found myself strangely attracted to this woman. Now, to put this into perspective as objectively as possible, I'd place myself at the 70-75th percentile of men, but definitely improving. I get a fair amount of female attention, and I've turned away women before who I deemed unsuitable as a long term mate. This being disclosed, one would wonder how I found myself attracted to an objectively ugly woman. Besides her being small(my preference), it all lay in demeanor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThroughout our day, she carried herself in a way that was feminine and confident. She displayed competence in dealing with our customers, but was never combative or competitive in her work. She spoke softly and smiled often, and the few times we spoke she was supportive and complimentary. She brought my partner and I lunch and was attentive to our needs whilst working. Furthermore, in the end of day discussion and planning for the future between my partner and I, she contributed without wresting control of the conversation from either of us.\n\nThat is to say, she was demure, pleasant, competent, attentive and feminine. Notice that all of these traits can be cultivated. When I drove home that day, I decided that I would easily rate her as above the majority of women I knew. If there were a woman who was even near average on looks with the same traits, I'd wager I'd be lovestruck in an instant.\n\nNow, I'm much more family\/relationship oriented than the average man, so there is a morsel of bias to be had here. However, if it is a committed relationship is what you're after, then allow me to assert that it is men of my ilk you should be after.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe moral of the story is, no matter what biological hand you've been dealt, you can increase your value as a woman dramatically by being feminine, competent, attentive, and pleasant. This is because after braving the world, men need a home. That home is not a house. That home is you.","title":"A word of hope for you who may feel hopeless","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9d7pe0\/a_word_of_hope_for_you_who_may_feel_hopeless\/"}

This astonishing revelation was heralded by trumpet fanfare and a new fad sweeping the psychological community (which should tell you something about the average intellectual calibre of that profession). \n\nToday, while the professionals have largely moved on to other, even stupider, things, this concept has lingered on in the popular concept of what psychology is, largely because it is easy to grasp, easy to explain things with, and impossible to predict anything with and thereby be proven wrong. This allows otherwise useless people to feed themselves by writing articles for Cosmo, and people who know nothing about anything to sound smarter than they are during casual conversation. \n\nAnd where you encounter the words \"self-esteem\", you almost invariably encounter the word \"women\". \n\nIn fact, aliens reading random samples of earth's modern printed material could be forgiven for mistakenly thinking that \"women's self-esteem\" was our most precious resource, which we use to catalyze working nuclear fusion reactors, or distill to cure cancer, or something. \n\nIn fact, a lot of humans, who live on earth and should know better, seem to believe this as well. It always makes me smile when I am accused by some outraged feminist or tradcon, of \"trying to lower women's self-esteem\", often with the codicil \"so they will be easy prey for men\". (*At which point she glances backwards to find a soft spot, faints dramatically , smelling salts are fetched, and a good time is had by all.*)\n\nTechnically, of course, they are absolutely right. What they, and pretty much anyone else, have never thought about, however, is a simple question: **What makes everyone so sure that having the highest possible self-esteem is good for you?**\n\nNo one ever explained that to you, did they? They just took it as their starting point. *Obviously* a high self-esteem is good, and a higher self-esteem is better, so here's how you go about convincing yourself that you are best thing evaaar. \n\nWell, yes, this *is* obvious, and like about 50% of obvious things, it's also dead wrong. \n\nIf you look at successful and happy people, you'll find they all have high self-esteem. That's why people are tempted to conclude that high self-esteem makes you successful and happy. This, of course, is backwards. Being happy and successful gives you high self-esteem, and it doesn't work the other way at all. \n\nWhen you start to think about it this way, it becomes clear. [This](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/df\/5e\/9d\/df5e9dd6aab05b5e31961000bbf5c10f--gorgeous-redhead-beautiful-women.jpg) girl obviously thinks she's beautiful, because she has access to a mirror, and her eyes work. But if [this](https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/amy-schumer.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1) ... whatever that is... believes the same thing, will she be happy? \n\nShe will persistently wonder why nothing ever seems to work out like she expects. \n\n**In practice, self-esteem is not like wealth (more is better), but like insulin: Too little will hurt you, but so will too much.**\n\nWe live in a society and era where the male ego is systematically starved (and then called \"fragile\" when it exhibits signs of that starvation), while the female ego is fed, and fed, and then force-fed some more with a tube down its throat as if we were trying to produce *foie gras*. This means that, while both too much *or* too little self-worth is bad for both men and women, **the most common self-esteem problem that women face is \"having too much of it\"**.\n\nThis leads women to chronic disappointment, envy of others, and most importantly, to making really bad moves in their efforts to get and keep the best relationship they can. \n\nIn my next article here, we'll discuss how to detect low and high self-esteem problems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"The Cult of \"Self-Esteem\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8ww90e\/the_cult_of_selfesteem\/"}

We have a deep and innate desire to be loved and cared for.  In the last chapter we discussed our men\u2019s correspondingly deep desire for respect. **The question for men is not then \u201cam I lovable\u201d it is instead \u201cDo I measure up?\u201d** And a man will look to those who know him best to answer that question. \n\n\nWe think of our men as strong and confident with no self doubt. But in truth men have an inner vulnerability that stems from two competing drives. Men wants to tackle great challenges, try difficult things and conquer the world. Competing with this is the very real possibility of failure which is excruciating for men to consider and cope with. As we learned from Chapter 2, one of men\u2019s greatest emotional needs is to feel competent at what they do. The problem is that men overwhelmingly feel that what they do is constantly being watched and judged. Though they have the drive to succeed they *feel* that they are one mess up from being found out as impostors.\n\nThe author\u2019s studies found that about three quarters of men feel insecure and doubt their ability to \u2018hack it\u2019. This comes up in nearly all areas of their lives. This means work, home and play. The word she, and the men in her surveys, use to describe these feelings is \u201cimpostor\u201d.  \n\nThe men in our lives are hiding a deep sense of self doubt. The inner uncertainty leaves even the most confident man dreading that he will be exposed for the imposter he feels himself to be. Even the most confident and in control men will often feel like like sometimes they are faking it and fear that their inadequacies will be discovered. \n\n\n\nEvery man wants to do well and appear competent at whatever it is he sets out to do but 76% claimed that they are *\u201cnot always as confident as I look.\u201d* A man worries that if anyone, like his boss or his loving wife, knew him for who he really is, they would realize the truth. This truth, of course, is that at least some of the time he\u2019s not who he appears to be. He\u2019s not the confident, self assured, competent man who he projects to the world. And the idea that someone knows he can\u2019t cut it is humiliating.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### What is he thinking? \n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t cross your mind that your man is lacking in confidence. After all, you chose him and you have the utmost confidence in him. And when expressed properly, our confidence in him *can* translate into confidence in himself. But many men express these fears of inadequacy or being found out.\n\nThe surveys show that men think: \n\n* \u201c**I\u2019m always being judged** - Men are hard enough on themselves without any external pressure. But there *is* external pressure. And whether it is true or not, they feel that the eyes of the world are trained on them. Though it is us women who receive the blame for caving to social pressures; men also think about how others perceive them. They are being judged and so are their abilities. **Jokes about men\u2019s inadequacies hurt most because they confirm men\u2019s fear that they are being judged and are falling short.** \n\n* \u201c**I have no earthly idea how to do this**\u201d - Men can feel like they are impostors at what they do and often feel that they are running to stay one step ahead of others. This especially occurs when they have to do something new and unfamiliar. One man told the author that when given a new task or challenge he thinks, *\u201cI have no idea how to do this and I hope I learn it before someone finds out\u201d*. She originally thought that this was an attitude that affects only the young and inexperienced but through her research she heard the same sentiment from highly accomplished men as well. \n\n* \u201c**But I want to do this**\u201d In the face of self doubt, men still want to try something new and possibly fantastic. There is a fear that if they try they will be publicly outed as an \u2018impostor\u2019 but the only way for a man to move forward in the world is to try new things. **The times when men are attempting something new are the times when they will feel the shakiest and need the most encouragement**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### They can feel like impostors at work\n\nThere has always been uncertainty for a man regarding his adequacy at his job. This has only gotten worse for our men as companies act with less loyalty and fewer people stay in one firm for their entire careers. Men can feel incredible anxiety and uncertainty about how they are performing at work. There is usually an underlying fear of being found out and of course the subsequent consequences of being deemed an impostor by your boss. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure whether your man falls into this category, well, he probably does. But think about his behavior with work. Does he he works long hours to prove that he can provide for you? Does he come home drained because of the constant need to appear competent and on the ball? \n\nProfessional sports and corporate America share the same \u201cWhat have you done for me lately\u201d attitude. Everyone is on the replacement list and you have to stay off the top. Insecurity seems logical when you look at it that way! This is often why men work such long hours. It is insurance in his mind that he won\u2019t fall behind.\n\nAnd the fear of failure isn\u2019t entirely negative. It can drive him to get out of bed in the morning, to get to the gym, to accomplish his goals.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n### They can feel like impostors at home\n\nA man\u2019s performance anxiety doesn\u2019t end at the front door. Many men reported feeling as concerned about inadequacy at home as in the office. Men want to be good husbands and fathers but they worry that they may not know how to succeed at everything required of them. And unlike the office, where success can be attached to numbers and performance reviews, the measure of success is *much* harder to pin down at home. \n\n**Many men judge their success as husbands based on the happiness and respect of their wives.** If a man is trying to bluff his way through being a husband, he will feel relieved when his wife feels loved and happy or publically honors how well he does at husbanding. If he gets the cold shoulder, a wife who challenges him or expresses displeasure or lack of respect it\u2019s a sign to him that he\u2019s an imposter and not doing well at his \u201cgood husband\u201d goal. \n\nNo man thinks he has all the answers. He\u2019ll often look to his father as a role model. If he has a good father, he will mine those experiences for guidance. If, however, he had a bad father he\u2019ll feel like he\u2019s making it up as he goes along. \n\nSometimes, if a man has the sense that he\u2019s an impostor as a husband and father he will  withdraw from taking an active role with his wife and kids. He pulls away to protect himself if he doesn\u2019t think he can do it well or be affirmed in what he\u2019s doing.\n\nFair, probably not, but emotions aren\u2019t fair. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n### What should we do for our men? \n\nIt is often said that you cannot change a man. This is particularly the case when we are talking about the way he is wired. We can, however, impact how he feels about his ability to make his way in the world. \n\nBecause men have these private doubts about how they measure up, our respect can be immeasurably important. Once we understand that these fears underly how he moves through the world we can see that our words and actions can make a huge impact.\n\nThe key is to soothing a man\u2019s worries is affirmations and a bit of plain old flattery. If the person who knows him best believes in him, he is empowered to do well in every area of his life.  If he isn\u2019t receiving affirmation from us, he\u2019ll seek out places that he can receive affirmation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Never tear your man down. If a wife reinforces her husband\u2019s fears of inadequacy it can become a self fulfilling prophecy**. In the survey\u2019s the author found that *only* 1 man in 4 felt appreciated by their families. She suggests that it is unlikely that 3 out of 4 families did not appreciate their men but perhaps were not expressing their appreciation enough.\n\nSo even if we do truly appreciate our men, *and of course we do!*, are we showing it enough?\n\nYour husband has to be convinced that his wife thinks he\u2019s the greatest. If he doesn\u2019t feel this way, he\u2019ll seek out validation elsewhere. There are many place men will seek solace from an unappreciative family: \n\n* Maybe he\u2019ll spend more time at work where he feels alive and on top of his game, \n\n* He might spend too much time watching sports for the competitive thrill \n\n* Some men will retreat to a workshop or office where they are in control of their environment or tasks \n\n* Another will seek out the intern who admires him.\n\n* Some participate in sports where there is built in admiration and accomplishment \n\nNone of these (well maybe the intern) are negative indulgences for your man. If he finds something that makes him feel alive and encouraged, great! However, other pursuits should not be a retreat for an unsatisfying home life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Our goal is to make him feel alive and encouraged at home first and to act as a cheerleader for his other endeavors. This means admiring him for his accomplishments, bragging about him to friends, expressing what a wonderful father and husband he is. And of course sex.**\n\nSex **is** affirmation!!!! It plays a huge role in a man\u2019s self confidence. A man can be having a horrible time in every other area of his life but if his woman wants him physically he\u2019ll feel capable of handling it all. On the other hand, if he gets the *don\u2019t touch me* message at home then it will be more devastating than failures in the other areas and he\u2019ll feel an impostor in every area. \n\nHome should be a comfortable safe zone for a man. If work is a place of judgement, then home should be a place where he can relax and open up. It should not be a place where a man feels one misstep away from being exposed. \n\nAnd this can be hard. If we don\u2019t pay attention, it\u2019s easy to only notice our men\u2019s mistakes. If we find ourselves in a pattern of noticing mistakes too often (and not praising accomplishments large and small) we create a situation where our men cannot relax and open up at home. It is up to us to create the intimate and safe environment to make it possible for him to let down his guard. \n\n**Home should be a retreat from the pressure of having to perform.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n### The gift of confidence. \n\n\nMen put a lot of pressure on themselves. One man told the author, \u201cI want my wife to understand my weakness and shortcomings and still want me. I want her encouragement to become the man I can be.\u201d  And ladies, I\u2019m sure you already feel confident that he can be everything he believes he can be. The only additional step is to express those feelings!\n\nBy staunchly supporting them and their goals, by constantly showing and telling them that we believe in them, and by providing a safe environment for them to come home to, we can give our men the confidence to dive into the work fray. \n\nJack Welsh explains (*emphasis mine*): \n\n> Perhaps the greatest single gift she gave me was self confidence. It is what I looked for and tried to build in every executive who has ever worked with me. *Confidence gives you courage and extends your reach. It lets you take greater risks and achieve far more than you ever thought possible.* Building self confidence in others is a huge part of leadership. It comes from providing opportunities and challenges for people to do things they never imagined they could do; rewarding them after they reach success in every way possible.\n\nA wife can give her husband that confidence. You must realize that in spite of the veneer of confidence our men still crave our affirmation that they\u2019ve done good. Tell him, often, that you are proud of him and believe in him, brag about him and his accomplishments loudly to the world and show him how much you desire him as a man.\n\n**Life is a battle and if he can return home to someone who supports him unconditionally, he can slay dragons.** \n\n","title":"'For Women Only' - Insecurity & Affirmation - Chapter 3","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8f6upu\/for_women_only_insecurity_affirmation_chapter_3\/"}

I've said it before in discussions and have received strange reactions from men and women in the sub. One man even private messaged me to tell me I shouldn't be bad mouthing my husband! Well, he *is* a greater beta, and that's not a bad thing. I don't want an alpha, I wouldn't be happy with one. Here is my case for the Greater Beta.\n\n**What is a Greater Beta?**\n\n\n At TRP, beta is synonymous with \u201cb!tch boy,\u201d or \u201cpu$$y\u201d, while alpha is synonymous with \u201cgod\u201d. So I understand the confusion when women come here and they think they want an alpha or suddenly feel like the person they're with isn't good enough.  I found myself facing this apparent dilemma almost 3 years ago. I had been married six months before discovering the red pill and I'm reading all of the material in the manosphere thinking to myself, \u201cOh my God, I married a loser. Mr. Dunham is a beta b!tch.\u201d However, once I applied the tenets of *Fascinating Womanhood* and *The Surrendered Wife*, I began to notice a change occurring in him too, *just as Mrs. Andelin and Mrs. Doyle predicted!*  \n\n\n Greater Betas are the reluctant leaders. They have leadership qualities and abilities but don't vie for that spot. If it's given to them they'll accept the position as leader. They have certain beta qualities but balance them out with enough alpha qualities so they aren\u2019t spineless. Now while some men are born alpha and some men are can become alphas, the same is true with Greater Betas. My husband, before I began my RPW journey, was a beta. He listened and followed my directions without question. He didn\u2019t argue and rarely challenged me and if he did, I made sure he was sorry. However, when I fixed myself and my attitude, Mr. Dunham also changed (a story for another time!)\n\n\n The reason my husband followed my orders is because it's in his nature to be agreeable and go-with-the-flow than disrupt the waters. Some personality traits that I have observed in Mr. Dunham that prove to me he's GB are as follows:\n\n * Reluctant Leader: when I moved out of the driver's seat, he sat down. But I had to move, he didn't ask me to.\n\n * Has Leadership qualities, can rally a team, can lead a team: he does this at work, he's always been the secondhand man for any boss, has been the assistant branch manager at a bank and at a cell phone store.\n * Has the ability to be aggressive and stand his ground, but chooses the situations carefully. My sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9e never backs down from a fight (literally, he's broken bones in his hand fighting before) whereas my husband won't pick up bait and won't bait a guy into fighting. However when a fellow salesman he works with encroached on his territory, Mr. Dunham came down on him severely and raised hell at his office. \n\n * Goes into autopilot and will ask me the dumbest questions, \u201cIt's 9:30, should we get our coats on to leave?\u201d \u201cShould I feed the kids breakfast now?\u201d and I have to remind him to make decisions himself \n\n * At the beginning of my RPW journey, he told me he didn't want to be the leader and wanted to make decisions with me equally, he wasn't the right person to make decisions (this was during the phase of me practicing, \u201cwhatever you think!\u201d and he was despairing over the fact I wouldn't make a decision for him.)\n\n * He will totally beta out (and here I mean wuss out) with his ex-wife about decisions concerning his two boys with her. \n\n\n For me and for probably many women, the GB is enough of a leader for us. Mr. Dunham goes out of his way for a compromise with me (even though I adhere to the \u2018defer to his decision\u2019 rule) on things, he passes comfort tests and some shit tests (he's the king of amused mastery without knowing what it is), he's charming, witty, funny, and can be arrogant, but just enough to make me want him, not enough for it to bother me. Mr. Dunham is the perfect middle ground for me. \n\n \n If you think your SO is too spineless to stand and you need to find a Chad, first fix yourself because your SO may blossom into a GB. The GB is the perfect mix of alpha\/beta traits and will satisfy women more than they may actually think. If you find the alpha personality too domineering and the beta too revolting, you may just be after a Greater Beta. \n\n\n\n ~Sadie","title":"The Case for the Greater Beta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5t2j5j\/the_case_for_the_greater_beta\/"}

How do we talk about sex without it being pornographic in nature and TMI? I\u2019ve seen a few posts on here about *dead bedrooms* and *waning libidos* and this petulant attitude towards sex\u2026 BUT I DON\u2019T WANNAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nBoo *frickin\u2019* hoo ladies.\n\nAside from medical reasons why you cannot have sex\u2026. No. Wait. Fuck that\u2026 there should be no reason why you can\u2019t please your man. If your vagina is broken, there are other ways to please a man\u2026. Ahem\u2026 beej\u2026.ahem\u2026butt\u2026.ahem\u2026hands. So with that little disclaimer I will continue. \n\nWhat is the definition of a romantic relationship?\n\n>re\u00b7la\u00b7tion\u00b7ship \/r\u0259\u02c8l\u0101SH(\u0259)n\u02ccSHip\/ noun: the way in which two or more concepts, objects, or people are connected, or the state of being connected.\n\n> ro\u00b7man\u00b7tic \/r\u014d\u02c8man(t)ik\/ adjective: conducive to or characterized by the expression of love.\n\nSo. You have two people being connected through expressions of love. What is one of the biggest expressions of love and trust? Sex. Making whoopee. Doing the horizontal mambo. Sure, sex can happen with anyone but there is no connection component to it. That is the line of demarcation. That singular component which makes sex into something beautiful and amazing. I told my daughter sex is not love, but sex is always amazing when done with someone you love. \n\nHere you are in a relationship with someone you love at this point. You\u2019re feeling like the sex part is waning. You\u2019re always tired from work. You don\u2019t have the energy for it. You spend your days with the kids and you just want to sleep. I\u2019m going to explain why you need to knock it off and also tips for knocking it off and being in your relationship\u2026.. romantically. \n\n**Being available all the time**\n\nThis is the toughest idea to get through to women. The idea that you should be available to please your man all the time. I\u2019m not saying you need to rush home to blow your man in the middle of the work day because he needs it now (although that would be a good idea if your job allows for just leaving in the middle of the day lol). Don\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019m saying that when your man is flirting and signaling to you he wants you, you should really be all in. This man finds you sexually attractive? Can you blame him? You\u2019re one hot chica! Own that. \n\n*Argument 1*\n\n> I shouldn\u2019t have to have sex when I don\u2019t want to. \n\nWhile this is true, this attitude is detrimental to a romantic relationship. You are signaling to your partner that you aren\u2019t attracted to them and that you don\u2019t need them for this type of intimacy. This type of thinking relegates your SO to being put in the \u2018just anyone\u2019 demographic. This removes their status of partner in your life and puts them in a position to be used when YOU want to use them. It makes it a one way street which is the antithesis of being in a relationship. \n\n*Argument 2*\n\n> I\u2019m too tired from ::insert other things in your life::\n\nOne of the most important things to realize is that if you are in a relationship, it is work. It is a part of what you need to set aside energy for specifically in order to maintain it. If you put more effort into other portions of your life, do not be surprised when your relationship fails. Just like a garden, it must be tended to regularly. Is work what you fancy more than your partner? Is being a mom more important to you than the person you share your life with? (NOTICE: I did not say are your kids more important to you than your partner. Please note that I am not telling you to pick between them, however, you need to prioritize your position as a partner more than your position of being a mom. Your partner is there for life. Your kids are not.)\n\nPutting life into perspective in terms of relationships can be hard. Is your partner really a priority to you? If not then you either need to next the SO you have because that is horse shit or you need to realize that maybe you just don\u2019t really want to be in a relationship at this time. You are basically using someone to have a warm body next to you for fear of being alone. Wanting a career more than a relationship is fine, but you shouldn\u2019t be imposing the loss of connection to someone else just because you don\u2019t need it. \n\n*Argument 3*\n\n> My partners libido is too high\/My libido is too low\n\nMatching libidos is a huge issue in deadbedrooms. If you are a low libido person, then you should really be taking steps to mitigate that. There are plenty of ways in which you can overcome the low libido\/high libido discrepancy. There was another post on there that I found really interesting that tl;dr says this \n\n> If sex is not a priority to you, then you shouldn\u2019t care if he goes out to find it somewhere else. \n\nDoes that hit a sore spot with you? Then sex is a big deal to you. More than you allow yourself to feel. Maybe your body doesn\u2019t comply but your brain just said \u201cwhoa whoa whoa CQ! Sex is important to me and I\u2019ll be damned if my SO goes to get it from somewhere else\u201d. Now that I have your attention. Listen up carefully. Sex is not just penis in vagina. I repeat. SEX IS NOT JUST PENIS IN VAGINA. So get that idea that out of your head right now. \n\n\n*Argument 4*\n\n>He is bad in bed\/doesn\u2019t last that long\n\nThis is trial and error. If you are not communicating to your partner the things you like then that is your fault. As someone who has a high N count, when you tell a man what you like they do that a lot. The ones who don\u2019t are selfish not only in bed but in life and will never change and you should have figured that out during the vetting process to being with. \n\n**How to fix it**\n\nWith all of these in mind, I\u2019m going to give you some pointers on how to overcome those arguments. I\u2019m sure that there are other arguments but really they fall into those four categories. They just manifest themselves in other ways. \n\n*The perpetual flirt*\n\nHow do you communicate to your partner that you are sexually attracted to them? You show\/tell them. All the time. Some of the things that you might do for this are the following. \n\n* Tell them something sexy at random times of the day.\n\n* Wear something a bit sexy and flaunt your womanly goods. (ie bend at the waist not the knees)\n\n* Sext him something you want to do to him \n\n* Make a lewd gesture when no one is looking\n\n* Rub your body on them \u2018accidentally\u2019 with a teehee and a wink\n\nThe point is to be playful. Sex is natural. Sex is fun. (a la George Michael). Show him that you like\/need\/want his touch. Flirt. That costs you nothing. Not even energy. This will not only build him up but it will get you in the mood too. You will be thinking about it more and you will be more apt to be receptive to his advances. Not all sexual interactions have to finish in sex. They do have to demonstrate you want him\u2026all the time. \n\n*\u201dI\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by ::other things in life::. What should I do?\u201d*\n\nWith a lot of the issues, you find that your life is overwhelming you. He is your captain. Ask him what you should do about it. Maybe he tells you to cut back on your hours at work. Maybe he tells you to find a babysitter for the kids so you can practice self-care. Whatever it is, your captain can come up with something for you to be able to balance out your work\/home life. He wants to be a priority in your life too so talking to him about it will allow for an opportunity to create more intimacy. So what if the dishes don\u2019t get done asap? So what if you don\u2019t cook one meal this week? Are these things worth it to sacrifice your relationship over? I doubt it. Tell him why you are too tired to do him and I am positive he will come up with a solution!\n\n*Smack it down, flip it, rub it down oh noooooo*\n\nWell this is where it gets a bit raunchy. I\u2019ll try to tone it down as much as I can but really you can\u2019t talk about the attitude of being sexually available without addressing some salacious aspects of it. Lube. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for it. Anal. Don\u2019t be afraid to try it. (there is a training manual for this). Blowies. Don\u2019t be afraid to get on your knees. Porn. Don\u2019t be afraid to watch it. Costumes. Don\u2019t be afraid to wear them. Sex doesn\u2019t need to be all about you getting to the finish line. It is an act of intimacy between two people. Get sex toys. Do whatever you have to do in order to get there physically. With so much sex paraphernalia out there, you can figure out what you like and get some tools to help you get there.\n\nNo excuses. \n\nLastly, if you have a captain who just simply does not give a shit about your well-being (ie demanding sex when you\u2019re sick, goes in dry, doesn\u2019t want to please you)\u2026 HE IS A SHITTY CAPTAIN. NEXT!\n\nedit: just for fun\n\n*[I wanna sex you up](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kO6BtpIzIiM)* **Color Me Badd**\n\n*[Lets talk about sex](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ydrtF45-y-g)* **Salt-N-Pepa**\n\n*[I want your sex](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ij_rqLiI43Q)* **George Michael**\n\n\nDouble edit: Another point to make is that if you were to start a new relationship today and came up with the same excuses you do with your SO as to why you don't want to have sex, do you think they would stay with you for very long? \n\nTriple edit: all this coming from someone named coochquarantine haha the irony.

I wish you the best for 2015.\n\nThere was a thread that said that the RP is much tougher to swallow for women, but it was pretty emotionless and impersonal, so I wasn\u2019t satisfied. That's why I\u2019m making a new thread where I\u2019d like you to share your experience with the The Red Pill:\n\n**1. What were you like pre-red pill?**\n\n**2. How did you discover the red pill?**\n\n**3. What has it taught you? How has it affected you negatively and positively?**\n\nIn this other thread I talked about, \/u\/blueWidow raised an interesting question that was not answered by anyone. I\u2019d like that to be addressed here:\n\n**4. How did you manage to come to terms with the harsh red pill truths without becoming jaded?**\n\nThe sidebar says that, for men, taking the red pill is like a grieving process::\n\n1. Denial\n\n2. Anger\n\n3. Bargaining\n\n4. Depression\n\n5. Acceptance\n\nI think it\u2019s the same for women. I\u2019m going through that process right now and I\u2019m currently stuck at stage 4. And a little bit of 2.\n\nI think that if I had found a testimony that described my experience on the internet, it would have helped me understand myself better and feel less alone. I'm writing this for people who need the help I needed and didn't find.\n\n**Disclaimer:** When I say \"women\/men are like this\", I speak about the vast majority, I understand that there are exceptions to the generalizations that I make.\n\n**Here's my experience:**\n\nI\u2019m a low SMV female. I'm physically a 3\/10. Because of bad genes, not because I let myself go.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get attention by looking nice, so I tried to work on my personality to be more attractive, but I don't have much going for me, so that didn\u2019t work out well either. I spent most of my life as the awkward kid who struggled to make and keep friends, let alone boyfriends.\n\nMy only consolation back then was my hope that I would meet a guy who would love me despite my looks one day. I was an avid reader of feminist literature that said that behavioral sex differences are not innate, men like the same traits in women that women like in men, etc. and these ideas gave me hope that I could maybe still find a good partner.\n\nBut I also couldn\u2019t help doubting that feminists (=females) were a reliable source about male preferences. So I searched the internet for male opinions and that's how I found the manosphere. It was anti-feministic so I found it very uncomfortable to read, but I couldn't turn a blind eye to the fact that the sexual strategies it promoted were effective. I spent days reading RP theory and I was surprised to discover what men were really like, not what mainstream culture said that they should be. I suspected that men and women were attracted to slightly different things, but I didn't expect that the differences were that big.\n\nIt turned out that women most importantly valued strong, confident, intelligent, driven leaders who made them feel safe and loved, as I already knew.\n\nBut men most importantly valued young, fertile, chaste, deferential, physically beautiful women who nurtured them and satisfied them sexually.\n\nThis sucked. I wished that this wasn\u2019t reality, but it was and I was stuck in it and it sucked.\n\n**Why did I hate that men are attracted to the things they\u2019re attracted to?**\n\n**Youth & fertility & beauty:** These features are so damn transient. We lose those no matter what we do. It's frustrating that our SMV depends on things we have almost no control over.\n\nFashion, dieting and exercise can help, but when you\u2019re ugly, these things don\u2019t make you beautiful, just maybe decent. I can pray to be saved by wife goggles, but still... so damn out of my control.\n\n**Chastity:** This must suck for high libido women, but it was pretty easy to accept for me, because my sex drive is so low that I have close to zero interest in casual hookups anyway.\n\n**Sexual satisfaction:** The problem is, the low sex drive would be a serious issue in a LTR. I knew that men had a higher drive, but not to the extent that RP taught me. RP made me aware of the fact that sex is a physical urge to men, they must have it often (either with a partner or alone). As a woman, arousal isn't as easy to stir, so I realized that I wouldn't be able to keep a man satisfied without regularly forcing myself to have sex that I\u2019m not in the mood for just for him.\n\nI found the idea of forcing myself to have sex like it's a chore so unromantic it was repugnant. That's not what mainstream culture says that married life will be like. Mainstream culture says that sex needs to be a special expression of love that's enjoyable for both partners, so if she's not in the mood, it's not happening and he should just respect that lest he objectifies her. The fact that RP contradicted this rubbed me the wrong way because RP desacralized sex.\n\nI felt even more pressure after RP taught me that men need sex to feel close to their mate and not having it makes them feel painfully undesirable and not loved. I would feel loved and desirable just with cuddling, lots of hanging out together and occasional sex. It was hard for me to believe that this wasn't enough validation for men.\n\nRP also taught me that sexual monogamy was a great struggle for a man. Even when in love with one woman, he fights the urge to have sex with many different women. And even when he's 50, his sexual preference remains set on the looks of 18 year old girls, so he can lose desire for his wife that he loves because she changed so much with age that she's too far from his natural standard. Mainstream culture says that he should desire the person he loves even after 40 years of being together, but apparently men just aren't wired that way.\n\nI think that his personality would make him desirable to me even after he lost his looks with age and I don't have this need for sexual variety at all. The fact that my man would never be able to reciprocate such exclusive and long-term desire for me was another painful slap in the face of my romantic ideals.\n\n**Nurturing:** That means being sweet, playful, receptive, sensitive, supportive.\n\nI hated this because it\u2019s a trait that is so easy to have.\n\nWomen's standards for a mate push men to be as powerful as they can be, but men's standards for a mate don't. They are low standards in comparison, which means that high SMV men have a myriad of high SMV women as options.\n\nThis RP truth made me feel insecure about my ability to keep a man, knowing that my high SMV man could very easily replace me with one of the many other women who fit his low standards. So much for feeling special.\n\n**Deferential:** This one is about the Captain\/First Mate dynamic that is advocated on here.\n\nMy problem with this was that I had trouble accepting the RP idea that women are naturally more attracted to nurturing roles while men are naturally more driven to go outside and conquer the world, as opposed to the feminist misconception that women and men are naturally the same in that regard. It explained why men have invented and built so much more. This truth was painful to accept because it makes me feel inferior to men.\n\nAs First Mates, we assume the supportive role while men are being CEOs, doctors, engineers, etc. And society values men for their achievements because only a limited number of people can do what they do. The male role is prestigious and elitist, whereas nobody stands in awe before the woman who does the child-rearing and the housework behind the curtains. Most people can do what she does, so society doesn't value her work. Value positively correlates with rarity. This led to the conclusion that, to society, feminine traits are inferior to masculine traits. (\u201cvalue to society\u201d =\u201csocietal value\u201d from now on.)\n\nAs a woman, I hated this conclusion. Being of inferior societal value just felt humiliating and demoralizing.\n\nThe RP fact that men prefer feminine (=nurturing) women only added to this feeling of humiliation. It meant that women\u2019s sexually valuable personality traits are traits that have inferior societal value than men\u2019s sexually valuable personality traits. Feminism didn't raise me to be okay with that fact. It raised me to find the male preference for societally inferior traits in their mates demeaning, so that\u2019s how I felt. Offended, degraded.\n\nAnd to make things worse, it turned out that even I preferred mates that I'm inferior to. I was raised to want an equal relationship, but *my own body* betrayed me by responding more favorably to dominant, powerful men than to betas, so feelings of embarrassment and self-depreciation ensued.\n\nWhen I encountered one of those chauvinist man-trolls on the internet who like to rub it into women's faces that they have superior societal value and they have it better because they're men, it got under my skin, but there was nothing I could say back because it was all true. It made me frustrated and jealous.\n\nYes, I began wishing that I was a man.\n\nBecause high SMV men have high societal and sexual market value and they hit the wall when they\u2019re, what, 45?\n\nBecause even low SMV men don't have it so bad compared to low SMV women. They can work on their SMV whereas us, ugly girls, better luck out and find a male freak of nature who does not care about looks or we\u2019re screwed.\n\nBecause feminism said that we \u201cneed men like fish need bicycles\u201d, but RP taught me that it's actually men who don't need us as much as we need them. It's like nature designed men to be the self-sufficient high achievers and we\u2019re the dependent sidekicks who they keep around just because we give them sex, babies, compliments to make them feel like goddamn superman and back rubs when they need a break from being awesome. They don't need romance to feel happy\/complete in life, they only need sex that bad. And their SMV lasts longer than ours, so they have the power to leave us for a younger, higher SMV woman after 15 years of marriage. They won\u2019t necessarily do it, but they can and we can\u2019t. We're at their mercy.\n\nWhat woman wants to hear that?\n\nIt\u2019s not just RP's portrayal of men that I found strongly repulsive, women's portrayal was worse: flat out incapable of romantically loving an equal or inferior man, naturally more inclined to not be introspective, to be irrational, disloyal, selfish, fickle, to \"swing branches\" and to perform annoying shit-tests. RP men made us sound like unruly children that they have to put up with and keep in check with \u201cFrame\u201d. I had the emotional impulse to reject that unflattering portrayal, but I also knew that I had to accept that that\u2019s reality. RP men have more experience with dating women than I have and they all agree on these things, so I assume that what they say about women's bad attitude in relationships is true, even though I don\u2019t personally observe it.\n\nHaving said all this, I think I can safely conclude that pride\/feeling humiliated is the biggest hurdle to swallowing the RP as a woman from a feminist culture. It might be difficult for you to sympathize with feminists, but their struggle is real (no pun intended). For some of them, denying gender essentialism and pushing girls to be more masculine is just a way to protect their self-esteem by proving that women have as much societal value as men. Their denial of reality has the potential to be annoying, but I can only feel compassion for them because I can relate so well.\n\nI\u2019m jaded. I'm in my late teens, but I already feel like I don't have much to look forward to.\n\nI used to swoon over romance movies and dream of Everlasting Love. To me, love was this wonderful, transcendental, erotic power that connected two Soulmates and made their lives complete forever. Then I swallowed the RP and love was demoted to simple economics \u2013 callous talk about sexual markets, plates, orbiters, walls and primitive evolutionary instincts. The magic was gone.\n\nAnd I know that I need to stop pity-partying and get the F over myself, but I can't get over it. I hate this reality. I hate the innate male\/female difference. I'm stuck in stage 4. And a little bit of 2.\n\nWhen I realized that I was wrong to put love on a pedestal, I considered giving up on LTRs altogether and being a WGTOW, but I doubt that I can be fulfilled in life just thanks to friendships and personal achievements, like a man can. I'm scared that if I do this, I\u2019ll end up as a lonely, regretful old cat lady.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oKgfjiIvalk\n\nNot very appealing, amirite?\n\n\nI'll see what the future holds...\n\n**TL;DR your testimony: RP killed some of my romantic beliefs when it taught me how different men's sexuality was and how much less they crave love relationships with women than women do with them. It also taught me that male standards for a good mate are transient and relatively easy to meet. Easy standards means that men's mates are more easily replaceable and transient means that women's attractive power has an expiration date. Therefore I, as an ugly woman, think that my options are limited to:**\n\n**1) Being with a high SMV man who will cheat\/dump me for another female who is younger, prettier and less frigid at some point.**\n\n**2) Settling for a secure relationship with a low SMV man that nobody wants and never having to worry about competition, but not being happy in that relationship.**\n\n**3) Being insanely lucky and finding a man who will make me happy (and vice-versa) and find something special to love about me despite that I have so little to offer.**\n\n**RP also taught me that sex differences are innate, so now I think that women are less valuable than men to society, because feminine traits are less \"societally\" valuable than masculine traits. It makes me wish I was a man. It feels humiliating and depressing for me to have low SMV and low societal value.**\n\n**RP made me realize that my idea of love was an unrealistic fantasy. Laying bare all the rules and inner workings of the feeling stripped love of its magic and painted such a repulsive image of it that I became jaded. Now I consider being a WGTOW, but I doubt that this lifestyle will make me happy either. I don't know what I'll do.**\n\nThis was my emotional journey. I'd like to read about yours too. Maybe venting on here will make swallowing the RP easier for you, like it does for me, so feel free to be verbose.\n\nFeel also free to comment on\/criticize my ideas, but with tact please, because I meant no offense, just honesty. I've read texts in the past about the pain of swallowing the RP for women, but most had an aggressive undertone that said \"You don\u2019t like it, huh? Well, deal with it, idgaf about your feeeels\" and that's more irritating than helpful. I think that tact, togetherness and compassion is much more conductive to emotionally accepting the bitter red pill, which is what this thread is about.\n\nThank you for reading. Especially if you read everything. \n\nUpdates: http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2s300i\/the_red_pill_made_me_depressed_what_did_it_do_to\/cnnj43l?context=3","title":"The Red Pill made me depressed.

Usually, it's a woman that's younger than them, but they're rarely ever under 30. When you think about it, a man who's moving up in the world doesn't have time to invest in a younger woman he essentially has to father. He wants someone that can benefit him beyond sex by improving his quality of life.\n\nFor example, Henry Cavill is dating a 32-year-old who has her own money, has experience working in television as a producer, and has powerful connections (her father is a Hollyweird exec). I mention him because he's the first gigachad that comes to mind that isn't dating the hottest and youngest woman he can find, even though he absolutely can. He seems to value intellect and experience more, but obviously looks and her being younger is still important. These men can get sex at any time and it's risky trying to mold a 20 year who could end up rejecting their teachings and waste their time.\n\nIt makes sense that a successful man would think strategically about dating. I'm not saying women should date the top 10% of men or squander our youth, but that high quality men demand more than just youth, a pretty face\/body, and good attitude. This gives hope to the women who may not be as attractive or young as other women but bring a lot to the table. Maybe this is obvious to you, but I never realized this until now.","title":"\"Top 10% of men want 20 yr olds they can mold\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/15maxvp\/top_10_of_men_want_20_yr_olds_they_can_mold\/"}

This week we are covering the broad strokes of RPW and this post in particular covers what constitutes **RMV**, or Relationship Market Value, and how men test us for it.\n\n******\n\n#**Wife Tests: A Single Girl\u2019s Guide to Being Wife Potential, Part I**\n\nAnyone who has ever spent any time in the manosphere has heard of Ian Ironwood. The man is a genius. I was recently going through some of his posts on his blog and I began re-reading the series he wrote called \u201cWife Tests\u201d. Now, Ian writes mostly for the male perspective but this series is helpful not only for men but also to women. There have been a few posts from lurkers or new posters asking about ways to improve their girl game or to up their game for future or current relationships. This series will be super helpful for RPW\u2019s new and experienced to read as it serves to instruct and remind us of everything we could be doing. I encourage every lady to read this series but as Ian is a tad verbose at times, I\u2019ve added my own Spark Notes version here. Enjoy!\n\n*Please note that when clicking on the links, Mr. Ironwood has retro pin-up-esque photos peppered throughout his posts, some of which may not be appropriate to view at work or around the presence of children. They are not pornographic by a long shot but some are definitely risqu\u00e9.*\n\n * [Red Pill Alerts:](http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2013\/09\/wife-test-red-pill-alerts.html)\n\nThis first article is a litany of phrases or utterances that can and should throw up red flags to men vetting a potential partner. \nThe first and most obvious red flag to everyone here should be a woman using the term **\u201crape culture\u201d**. \n\nAnyone uttering this phrase without a trace of humor or sarcasm will most definitely turn into a raging fem-nazi once the honeymoon period is over in a relationship. I don\u2019t feel a need to harp on this phrase for any length of time as I\u2019m certain we are all aware of how over used this phrase is among the feminist army. Fellas, stay away from this kind of woman, ladies, do not be this type of woman. You will nail yourself a low value beta using this mentality as any captain worth his salt wouldn\u2019t touch you with a ten foot pole. \n\nThe second \u201cred flag phrase\u201d is **\u201cdelicate male ego\u201d**. \n\nThis one should also be relatively self-explanatory. If a woman doesn\u2019t respect a man, *all* of a man (including his ego) he will not be properly satisfied in a relationship. Everyone has an ego and everyone loves to have someone else build them up (particularly if that other person is attractive).  To be a woman who not only won\u2019t build him up and stroke his ego (no matter how silly you personally may think it is) but will actually *tear down* his ego (and thus sense of worth in a relationship) is not an ideal candidate for a wife. \n\nThe third and final example I will pull off the list is the phrase **\u201cI want to work on my career\u201d**.\n\n Now many women, especially those newer to RPW may prickle at this being a red flag. Practically all women today assume (wrongly) that being highly educated will add to the sexual attractiveness. This is not the case. Men may be impressed or think you accomplished, however a fancy degree or a fancy job do not add to your SMV at all. In fact, Mr. Ironwood postures that it is a red flag for women to say \u201cI want to work on my career\u201d and I can see why. If you and a potential mate are on one of your first dates or just getting to know each other, you are essentially telling him that your career comes first, before anything, including him. No man wants to hear that. \n>\u201cA woman who sees herself as a professional first will only see herself as a wife and mother second.\u201d\n\n * [A Good Worker:]( http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2013\/11\/the-wife-test-good-worker.html)\n\nI purposely listed this article after the last bullet point because the two seem to conflict with each other. They do not. Mr. Ironwood clears up this seeming hypocrisy by explaining:\n> \u201cBeing \u201ca good worker\u201d isn\u2019t just an evaluation about her employment status and potential, it\u2019s an evaluation of her character when you broaden your scope to include old-fashioned housework and industry in general.\u201d\n\nBasically this article is discussing what to look for in a woman to ensure that she is not lazy or simply looking for a man to take care of her, rather she is someone who will do a fair share of the work and also care for her man. This is a rather important green flag us ladies will want to fly high when being vetted by a potential man! \nWhether your goal is to stay home after marriage and\/or children or continue working, there are a few things you should keep in mind now to ensure you are sending the appropriate signals. \n\nFirstly, a woman who won\u2019t work is obviously a red flag. But almost as big of a turn off is a woman who doesn\u2019t know when to stop working or forgets why or who she is working for. \/u\/SuperSlavisWife just posted a fantastic article a few days ago entitled \u201cLaissez-Faire Homemaking\u201d in which she tells of the dangers and pitfalls of trying to make your home perfect all the time. One such pitfall is becoming a tyrant in your own home. Insisting on perfection all the time puts your husband and kids on edge and does not make the home a happy, inviting place. Such a woman has forgotten whom she is working for. Who are you intending to serve by homemaking? Your answer should be \u2018your family\u2019. They shouldn\u2019t be being terrorized for the sake of the picture perfect home. So while it is important to not sit on the couch all day watching *The Price is Right* all day, it is also important to not become \u201cMonster Stewart\u201d. \nFor those women who are in the work force, it is important to remember that you have a family and to save some of yourself every day for them. Careers are important but not as important as your marriage and your family. \n\nSo how can single ladies demonstrate their ambition and industriousness? Ian answers this in the form of questions men should be asking themselves. Read the full list on his blog but a few of them are:\n\n * Does she ask for help even if she doesn\u2019t need it? (Laziness)\n\n * Does she try to get you to do her work for her? (Laziness, manipulation)\n\n * Does she have a hard time planning the project? (Lack of ambition, trouble planning for the future, laziness)\n\n * Does she clean up after herself?\n\n * Can she stop the job short of perfection? (knowing when to stop working)\n\n * Does she take pride in the work she does?\n\n * Does she need you to watch and\/or act as a cheerleader for her efforts? (validation-seeking, low self-esteem, attention seeking)\n\nThese and the other questions listed are important in determining in ourselves the message we are sending to our men. I encourage you to read the list and answer honestly, using introspection to identify potential places of improvement within yourself.\n\n *  [Domesticity:](http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2013\/11\/the-wife-test-domesticity.html)\n\nThe final wife test I\u2019m going to touch on today is \u201cdomesticity\u201d. \n>  One of the things a man seeks and finds value in when he is looking for his wife is someone with whom he can make a home.\n\nWhat a surprise. A man wants a woman who knows how to make a home an inviting, warm, soft place to land. Unfortunately because of the feminist movement eschewing any sort of activity related to feminine homemaking, it is a dying art. I myself had no idea how to add special little touches to my own apartment (and worse, I didn\u2019t realize they were missing!) My mother-in-law was the one who taught me the importance of homemaking and what an art it truly is. She showed me how a table cloth and some candles make dinner more special, how fresh flowers placed in a simple vase dress up a window, and overall how these small touches contribute to a house feeling like a home. It is definitely an art many women nowadays do not know how to create. \n\nLittle things Ian encourages men to look for in a woman\u2019s home (and thus little touches you can add to yours) are listed in their entirety on this blog post. A few include:\n\n * house plants \n\n * cat\/dog \u2013 how well are they cared for, groomed, the attention paid to them (all relates to you being able to dote on another living breathing creature. If you don\u2019t want a pet please skip this suggestion!)\n\n * general d\u00e9cor \u2013 does your house give off a warm, cozy feeling or does it feel like you cleaned out the sale section of Target? Are the pieces original and cohesive to give the house an overall feel or  is the paint and decorations discordant? \n\n * is the trash and\/or laundry piling up \u2013 obvious housekeeping skills \n\nThat\u2019s all for now, I thank you for reading and hope that these articles will be helpful in stepping up your girl game for your partner, either current or anticipated! I\u2019ll post part two in a few days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n~Sadie","title":"Back to Basics September: The Wife Tests [Part 1]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pmgczd\/back_to_basics_september_the_wife_tests_part_1\/"}

The first things was as new people at work she ignored me from the start. Did not sit or talk to me at breaks even after knowing no one. It also took a while for me to realize she didn't even want to have small talk with me. \n\nAnother thing before I continue is that she is very pretty, knows it very well for her age and is very confident. You can't boss her around she is the boss. I get the \"I was brought up like a princess\" vibes. She rides horses and has gone to french schools.\n\nSo she doesn't talk to me. She also doesn't want to work with me when we have a task to do at our job. She gets these other guys to hop in for her because they have a crush on her. She makes doors slam in my face if I walk behind her never bothering to hold the door for a second. When she walks behind me (which I'm not aware of as she is walking behind me) she does this thing where she picks up her pace, walks by me and then walks in front of me. She makes her petty games in the format  \"I come first you come last\".\n\nShe know she looks better than me and did this thing where she looked at me, twirled her hair and did a ballerina turn to walk away.\n\nOnce I spoke to her team leader, who also protects her as she always leaves earlier than she legally should, she seemed scared since he responded nicely and jokingly to me. It was a job question and not a mean move from my side to retaliate.  Later that week a guy made a cake for his b-day and she ate from it and said nothing. Other day I brought cake because I recycled the companies energy drinks. She ate from it, didn't say thanks to me but walks up to a table where me and this co-worker who is a guy eat. She turns her back to me and seductively tells him thanks for yesterday and the whole table got silent because she was very flirtatious and I felt humiliated. She thought I had a thing with this guy and did it to spite me. Also again, when this all started, we met at work. No one stole someones boyfriend. I don't speak to any of her orbiters other than work related matter.\n\nI'm so mad at this when I come home from work. I have rage attacks. \n \nMy anger (people at work have noticed) at her has been interpreted as me being the jealous older (uglier) woman.  It was because I followed her with my eyes when she spoke to other people and I noticed she spoke to most except me. Tbh in the beginning I really really was not envious but hurt at her behavior but as she has continued being mean I have become jealous. Mostly because she KNOWS she is young and pretty and uses it to her advantage. Also from the men that have protected her. This gets to me. I tried pulling the same thing with not holding up the door for her. A guy walking in front of me turned around when he noticed this and walked to personally hold the door up for her looking at me with anger. Another time she walked in front me and this alpha boss comes at our direction, he is married but has a huge crush with Julia and he looked at her said hi and ignored me. She is a having a emotional affair with him. He looks at her butt whenever she walks by him.\n\nI feel ashamed and I feel hurt. I feel hurt because it has nothing to do with her being younger or prettier than me. I can work with people. I can work with pretty girls. I can work with younger prettier girls. She is mean. She is mean. I feel ashamed at people at work seeing this and interpreting this as jealousy. I hate being the older bitter woman. I've been getting rage attacks when I'm at home. I want to hurt her. I'm mad that when I talked to a guy at work her said \"she's just a kid\". She know what she is doing.\n\nOn a last note she is triggering me at all these things. I'm not accomplished with school, I'm not pretty, I'm not young, I was beaten severely at home with no one who ever gave a f*ck about me. I have low self esteem. Socially I'm a marinade. I find friends slowly she does it fast. I keep seeing her good sides. She so beautiful and so mean to me and has all the alpha guys wrapped around her finger.\n\nShe is playing me and I don't know what to do. I don't want to be the bitter old woman. I've been had things taken from me by bitter older women like my mom and I frequent raisedbynarcissits. I want to know in the future how to behave around younger prettier girls as I age to not have the old and bitter stamp. I can be envious but I never bully.\n\nedit: thank you for your comments.

Some suggested I just bring my ideas to him. Other suggested I not bring up the exact source of my fantasies (the argument we had years ago), and try to just explain that I was seeking some heightened passion in our relationship. \n\nI decided to tell him about everything. I showed him my post and all of my responses. I didn\u2019t leave out a single detail. Our relationships is built on absolute honesty. We don\u2019t keep anything from each other so I felt it was important to be as open as possible. I kind of rambled on for a while and he listened, asked me clarifying questions, and listened some more. \n\nI\u2019m happy to say that he took my ideas very well. He ended up laughing at me for being so silly. I thought he\u2019d be weirded out a little by my fantasies but he saw them as completely normal! After the ice was broken he was eager to try things out. After a few days of research on his part we did a few things. \n\nFirst, he made me sign a paper contract about the terms of our roleplay. He also recorded it. We both signed. Essentially it stated that from this point forward, until I use our designated safeword, No does NOT mean no. Stop does NOT mean stop. Etc. The only viable withdrawal of consent is the safeword. Until that word is spoken all is fair game. He made me send a copy to my lawyer just to be safe. I also had a brief conversation with my lawyer. I\u2019m sure this wouldn\u2019t be necessary for most people but my man is VERY careful. \n\nSo onto the details of our roleplay. It\u2019s going to be sort of an ongoing thing until I choose to stop it. So in the past week how it has played out is, when not around the kids, he\u2019ll start to call me different pet names and his demeanor will change. He started to call me \u201cToots\u201d and \u201cBabe.\" Things he doesn\u2019t usually call me. Then he gives me stern orders. (We don\u2019t do this around the kids. Just in private).\n\nWe started with simple tasks just to go slowly. He\u2019d command me in that very stern voice. After a few days it got physical. The most notable day I think was Thursday. His entertainment room is off-limits to the kids and I have to be given permission before entering when is inside. (This was the case even before the rp). On Thursday I decided to seduce him. I barged in and tried to pressure him into sex in a very needy, whiney way. He got angry and \u201cpunished me.\u201d It was probably the most passionate session we\u2019ve ever had. We really went all out I think. I\u2019ll spare the details here but will be glad to go into more detail in private.\n\nFriday was a good day. The kids went straight from school to a sleepover and we had the entire house to ourselves. He is really getting into his role and I haven\u2019t spoken the safe word once. Despite him overpowering me I can tell he is being very careful not to hurt me. I\u2019m tiny compared to him. Yet he is very firm and he has started to scream, growl, and be much more rough than usual. \n\nWe\u2019ve actually talked very little about the dynamic of the relationship since we\u2019ve started. I actually don\u2019t want to talk much about it. Unlike usual, where we talk at length about a whole host of topics during our designated talk time, I want this dynamic to simply evolve somewhat naturally. I don\u2019t want him to do what I tell him to do. I want him to just act on what he wants. It\u2019s definitely more risky because he might do something to really hurt me but I trust him. It\u2019s very exciting. We seemed to have found a good balance. \n\nI\u2019d like to talk to others about their sexual experiences. Ideally in private. I\u2019ve been having long conversations regarding this with a few people in private and I\u2019d like to talk about it with more people. Thanks for listening! \n","title":"Update!

However, the purpose for operating these vehicles is vastly different for men and women. \n\nPeople drive motor vehicles for two main reasons. 1. To get from point A to point B. 2. To enjoy the ride in your vehicle of choice. Some people drive strictly for one of the two reasons and some people drive because of a mixture of the two reasons. \n\nLikewise, men hold conversation primarily for the **content** of what's being said, the destination. Women hold conversation primarily for the **connection** that results from conversing, the journey. \n\n**Human beings and human doings** \n\nThe idea that women are human beings and men are human doings is well established in TRP communities and discussed from time to time. Here, I will focus on how this concept relates to male and female conversation styles. \n\nAs a human doing, the default male setting is to **not** exist unless he's worthy of existence. Through accomplishment - doing - a man becomes worthy of existence. Whether this is true or not is irrelevant, this is the underlying premise behind many male thoughts, feelings and actions. Therefore, everything needs a goal to achieve, a mission to complete and a destination to reach. \n\nAs a human being, the default female setting is to exist, period. No reasons or goals necessary. A woman need not justify her actual existence, rather, she needs to **fill** this existence with more existence. She does this by connecting with **other people**. The purpose is the journey, not the destination. \n\nAs a side note - men tend to enjoy working with things and women tend to enjoy working with people. This is reflected in many areas of life. \n\n**The purpose of conversation** \n\nWe can now understand why there's often a huge chasm between men and women when we try to converse with one another. Especially between husband and wife. Your husband needs you to get to the point but for you there might not be a point, there's the journey of expressing yourself. \n\nThis chasm is so wide that it causes tension even between the best of couples. \n\nA caring husband **wants** to pleas and indulge his wife by listening to her carry on about all the details of her day. However, his mind is **wired** to seek a goal, a problem to solve, a point of summary. Listening to you ramble on is torturous to him like the cat trying to chase the laser beam. Despite his best efforts, his mind **will** tune her out and he'll be accused of not listening. This in turn will make conversation with his wife an anxiety inducing activity which he'll engage in anyway because it's a challenge to conquer. \n\nOTOH, the wife has emotional needs and part of these needs is for her to speak her mind to those who are close with her. Long conversation helps her bond with her husband and can even relieve her stress (often transferring it to him). If she can't converse with her husband, the marriage will be dry and dull for her. \n\nThis leads us to the stalemate of all stalemates - she **needs** to speak her mind and heart, he **can't** follow. As a result, she may feel like he isn't listening to her and therefore doesn't care about her. He may feel tremendous anxiety at the prospect of having to listen to her ramble on. He'll feel falsely accused of not caring. Thus, countless arguments ensue. \n\n**Some solutions** \n\nIt's clear that husband and wife need to understand each other's needs in conversation and to do their best to fulfill these needs without hurting their own needs. Here are some agreements you can reach that may help. \n\n* Edit - When possible, ramble to a close female friend. \n* Edit - That you let him know \"I need to vent\" if you don't want solutions. \n* That it be okay for him to cut the conversation at any point, even mid sentence. \n* That the conversation stop as soon as he cuts it. \n* That you don't take this personally. \n* That you not quiz him on what you said. \n* If it's clear that he missed some of what you said, let it slide. \n* That you summarize at the end. \n* That you appreciate his listening. Thank you for listening is a great way to end a conversation. Even better if it's followed by physical affection. \n* That you let him know when you want a solution and when you want him to just listen. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWords and conversation mean different things for men and women. For men it's about the destination, for women it's about the journey. \n\nDue to our wiring, conversation is a necessity for women and often a stress relief. Men can spend days together in silence, conversation can be stressful and anxiety inducing. \n\nTherefore, many misunderstandings may arise when men and women speak to each other. Men are accused of mansplaining and women are accused of rambling endlessly. These misunderstandings can cause a rift even in the best of marriages. Some basic agreements can greatly reduce these misunderstandings and increase peace and harmony in the home. \n\nCheers!","title":"Mansplaining decoded","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/99ab5c\/mansplaining_decoded\/"}

In retrospect, every relationship I ever had was based soley on my need for an emotional conquest over others. Or for personal validation. I didn't want a man, I wanted a heart receptacle. Many a night was spent anguishing over my failed attempts to secure one rather than examining all the toxic stuff I was doing.\n\n\nThen I found Redpill. Your posts forced me to begrudgingly take a look at myself, and my lifestyle. \n\n\n\n\nOver the last few years and with your ideology in mind I cut the crap and started exploring who I was alone. I focused on school, got my looks together, and started a business that I believe in instead of chasing yet another self serving \"relationship.\" That was a hugely rewarding challenge. \n\n\n\nI didn't date for a long time as I delved into the roots of my bad habits. I forced myself to read old cringey messages, dripping with ugly need, that I'd sent to ex's. It opened my eyes to how shortsighted, selfish and unfair I'd been to EVERY single man in my life. I never wanted to be like that again. \n\n\n\nI also realized that my deeply submissive \"bedroom\" self was just the woman inside me trying to seek light. I began cooking both for the joy of it and for my family, started taking actual pleasure in cleaning, and found a feminine love of presentation and decor that I didn't know existed. 3 years ago I lived in a dumpster. Now people audibly wonder how I pulled my home together. All it took was having pride in womanhood rather than shame over the possibility of domestic contentment. \n\n\n\nAll these efforts culminated into a self that I was ready to share, and about 9 months ago I met a fellow entrepreneur with whom I hit it off with. We're in a relationship now!\n\n\nI focus only on facts, or on him, his efforts, and his work. Never feelings. He takes genuine interest in me and my interests, surprises me with silly gifts or treats that make me smile (which I would have declined in the past due to bullshit principals), and tells me nearly every day that he appreciates the few free moments we can spend together. Probably because they aren't filled with me saying \"why can't we hang out more, I'm sad, blah blah.\" He isn't preparing for an emotional battle every day when he gets home, and that has allowed us to connect on a much more intimate and personal level than I've ever experienced. \n\n\nSo basically I've never had such a wonderful life or relationship and it's all because I stopped whining and started listening to you folks. So thank you, thank you, THANK YOU, all of you, for going against the grain and encouraging me through your existence to take this journey on. It's paid off in spades. \n\n \n\n\n","title":"Thank you, Ladies!

Each post will focus on a concept of RP theory. If it goes well, more posts will be added more frequently. Today's post will be about value. \n\n**What is value?** \n\nThe basic meaning of value is when someone or something is meaningful in some way. Everything that exists has value to someone, not everything has value to you. \n\nThe biblical idea that \"man is created in the image of God\" means that every human being has intrinsic value and we therefore may not murder them (or cause unnecessary harm to them). Not all societies placed intrinsic value on every human life but that's a separate discussion. \n\nEven if you agree that every human life has intrinsic value in the eyes of God, it's still true that not every person is valuable to you. Even among those who are valuable to you, you value some more than others. \n\n**Sexual and relationship value** \n\nIn the search for a suitable mate, one must ask themselves - does this person bring value to my life? How much value? What kind of value? What value do I add to their life? The answer will depend on what you're looking for. \n\nGenerally speaking, men and women value different things. Thus, men need sex, love, intimacy and a soft supportive landing from women. Women need sustenance, stability, commitment, leadership and bug squashing from men. (Partial lists here). Men and women each offer to the other, what the other needs. Thus, we complete each other. That's how it works when things are balanced and therefore working well. \n\nThere are some things that have value sexually but have no value or are detrimental to a relationship and vice versa. Therefore, when looking to start a LTR, attention must be given to balance your own conflicting needs with each other to find a happy medium. \n\n**Some examples of sexual value**\n\nMen are generally attracted to young, slim (but not stick thin) women who have curves (but aren't fat), who smell nice and are pleasant to be around. Who are receptive, open to their advances and less complicated. Of course there are exceptions, but this is generally the case. \n\nWomen are generally attracted to men who are better than themselves. Taller, stronger, smarter and wealthier are just some examples. Men who are fun, spontaneous and witty. Dangerous but protective of her. Women tend to be more picky and particular about what they sexually desire in a man. \n\nHaving more qualities that are valuable to the opposite sex, makes you a higher value potential sexual partner. You'll therefore be considered sexy by a greater number of members of the opposite sex. \n\n**Examples of relationship value** \n\nMen generally want a woman who's respectful and yielding, supportive and uplifting, and pleasant to be around. A woman who can create a soft landing spot for him, a cozy home to dwell in. A woman who can cook and keep house and not need his guidance on every detail. A woman who's frugal and appreciates what he does for her. A woman who will be a good mother if children are desired. A woman who's honest, kindhearted and pleasant to be around. \n\nWomen generally want a man who has stability of income, who can support them financially and emotionally, who will accept their emotional turbulence and who will be their rock. A man who will take on challenges that face the family whether big or small. A man who will lead and who is decisive. A man who will give her children and help her raise them (if children are wanted). \n\n**Conflicting values**\n\nThis is really worthy of its own post and perhaps another post will be written on the matter. But in short - some values conflict with others. For example the female sexual desire for a fun, spontaneous and witty man might be in direct conflict with her relationship desire for a stable, steady and responsible man. Finding the perfect balance in the same man is almost impossible and a highly unrealistic goal to set. These conflicting desires need reconciliation and a degree of compromise is absolutely necessary to have a sustainable marriage. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEverything has some sort of value, but only some things have value to you. The question is - what's valuable to you and how will you compromise to reconcile between conflicting internal values. \n\nCheers!","title":"Back to the basic - value","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8chfer\/back_to_the_basic_value\/"}

This means that those who are not are automatically more rare and of higher value. This post is for those who are in this category. You can figure out if you are in this category by figuring out your bmi. Or if you want to be difficult and argue with me about the validity of bmi you can find out your waist-to-height ratio. \n\nLosing weight is not hard even though people scream it is. At the beginning (if you are overweight\/obese) you don't even have to exercise. All you have to do is balance the equation. The ideal human body is an equation balanced by eating less calories than you use. You can figure out how much you use by googling BMR and figuring it out.\n\nAfter figuring out BMR you start counting the calories you eat and your daily deficit would probably be around 200-500 by eating 1200-1500 calories a day. \n\nFor the first month stick to this number religiously. Weigh yourself every week at the same time wearing the same thing (or nothing). This isn't for cruelty but to make sure you are properly balancing the equation. \n\nIf you are not losing weight sticking at a deficit then one of two things (or both) can be happening. \n\u2022 you're lying and not counting everything\/miscounting\n\u2022 you're BMR is lower than what you previously thought, so you need to eat less calories than you are currently **OR** you need to add in exercise to expend more calories.\n\nIt doesn't matter what condition you have this is how weight loss\/maintaining a healthy weight works. \n\nThe easiest way to ensure success is to plan properly. Research different foods and find out their calories and plan meals for the week. Stop drinking sodas and stop eating fast food (one combo meal is commonly around 1000 calories). \n\n**No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training.

I found this sub a bit ago and despite it being quite contrary to much of what I thought I believed and knew...well I've read every post since then and at least 7 pages of the top posts of all time and pretty much immediately purchased \"Surrendered Single\" and read it in a day. So, there's something here. Anyway this is my first post and I just made this account for the exclusive use of RPW (at the behest of a post I found). \n\nWhile I could not in earnest describe myself as RP (yet?), I wanted to contribute a bit of what I do believe I have locked down. You all place such a high priority on self-care which, BP or RP or other, is something I have learned to place an absolute premium on in the past 2 years and really sets me apart from my friends. To the point where, some of them aren't much of friends anymore. Call it judgmental but it just kills me to see them place no value on their health or long term well being and just *accepting* reality as whatever is easiest. \n\nAnyway, self-care has proved to be a snowball effect. It started with the gym, but the principles of respecting my body have eked into more places and more places. I started out overweight after literally never exercising in my life (other than the yearly \"I'm going to really do it this time!\" 1-3 days of half-heartedly sprinting til I died and doing crunches -- anyone else relate?) and now I'm in incredibly good shape. No fitness model for sure but I'd say upper 80-85% of the general population (and that may be less of a compliment to myself and more a low bar set by the general population). My skin is beautiful for the first time since youth and people (particularly women) comment on my teeth quite regularly (I don't even use whitening strips). I just *feel* great. I feel proud. And that was something I was used to not feeling. I don't have it all figured out, and hopefully you ladies can chime in with your tips and tricks as well, but here are some things I think many of us could benefit from. \n\nWithout further ado:\n\n**General**\n\n* When it comes to all these things, my first motto is 'motivation is doing what you have to do, when you have to do it, because you want to do it; determination is doing what you have to do, when you have to do it, even when you don't want to do it.' Don't trust motivation. It's a wonderful feeling and it's amazing to feel so driven but if that's your primary vehicle for reaching your goals..you're going to run out of gas. Once you accept, in your heart of hearts, these things (particularly the loathsome gym visits) are a part of your day and you can't change it...you stop dreading it anymore. Dread comes from some part of you acknowledging, even in the tiniest percentage, that it's optional. It's not optional and you can't change the weather either. \n\n* My second motto is \"consistency beats intensity\". I think that speaks for itself, but don't beat yourself up for slip ups -- just keep swimming. \n\n**Fitness**\n\nThe thing that blows my mind about exercise is how *not obvious* it is. I know the majority of times I gave up was because I truly didn't know what I was doing and it feels overwhelming. Figuring it all out takes longer than I could say in this post (as if I've figured it all out...) but maybe you can skip some of the initial horribleness.\n\n* First off, you should really enjoy it, where possible. It won't be all daisies all the time and I think it's good to subject yourself to unpleasantries in the name of the greater good, but at the same time you shouldn't hate it from start to finish. If you hate running, don't run. I began exclusively lifting weights for this reason. All I had done previously was lug my fat butt around the treadmill for a while and loathed it. Weight lifting is a great place to start. I suggest looking into Starting Strength, Brett Contreras 'Glute Goddess' routine, or even a standard 'bro split' (sorting the body into each muscle group and doing one group each day). It was extremely helpful to me to 1. Be doing a workout I enjoyed, and 2. Not going to the gym with any question as to what was happening that day. \n\n* If weightlifting is also not for you, I love rock climbing. As soon as I'm settled with a job I plan on getting a membership. It's an odd one that doesn't come to mind, but it's so much fun and really a great workout. Also observing your progress is straight forward and I think people underrate how important it is to watch yourself improve at a skill. It means a lot of good things for your whole frame of mind. Yoga is another obvious one. I also enjoy swimming though I haven't done it in far too long. Oh! Pole dancing. Love it. Could not recommend it enough -- it really is a beyond killer workout, it's also a great place to be around exclusively females, and if you enjoy it enough to bring it home with you the poles are shockingly affordable and I don't doubt any Captain would love a good show. If anyone does this please let me know!  Beyond those suggestions there are also adult league sports.\n\n* Commit to your routine. If you can go 5\/6 days a week...that is best. To me 5\/6 days a week for 1-1.5 hours a day is the ideal. I've been doing that for the better part of 2 years, it means a lot to me and I couldn't do without it. Commit yourself to what you're doing and soon you'll need your gym fix. If that's a bit much then I think the minimum is 4 days. I personally love giving myself 4 out of 5 days or 5 out of 6 days of intense workouts, and then the last day I'll walk for 6 miles (about 90 minutes). It's a really relaxing time for me and often the only time all week I allow any TV.  It's a reward I really look forward to. \n\n* For me, morning workout is best. I like to wake up at 4:45-5:30 and just get it done before anything else. It sucks at first, but I like to do it before I have time to overthink it and it does wonders for my energy and state of mind all day. I feel productive and proud and everything after that comes easier. \n\n* Also, start a workout notebook. Whatever your chosen exercise\/sport\/routine is-- log everything you can. I'm partial to Moleskin's calendar with the days of the week expressed vertically on lined paper, it's about the size of an index card and I keep it in my workout pack. I attribute much of my success to having a good system of accountability. It saves me time knowing how to improve from the week prior, and any day I don't exercise gets a big X. I've only twice missed more than a week, but each day I took the time to draw 7 big X's. Keep yourself honest. And now I have a collection of books that are a real source of pride for me. They help me not forget how far I've come when I get hard on myself. \n\n* Finally, do try not to be too hard on yourself. I went from a complacent chubby girl to the most self-critical one with a pretty rocking physique (though it usually doesn't feel that way). In my head I know there was a time where I would have slaughtered someone to look how I do know (though it never occurred to me that I didn't need to slaughter anyone, I could just...go to the gym), and now it sometimes feels nothing is good enough. I suppose it's the double-edged sword of self-improvement, but do what you can to celebrate your accomplishments. You deserve it!\n\n(I know I've gone a mile wide and an inch deep on this post and have possibly blabbed too much, but if anyone wants more in-depth information -- routines, advice, etc -- PM me. I'm really passionate about helping people do what always seemed just out of reach because I spent many many years feeling the same and it's just nice to have resources)\n\n**Food**\n\nI swear I'll keep this section shorter, also you ladies cook a lot and I wouldn't be so condescending as to give you instructions on how to boil water. \n\nJust a couple rules I try and follow:\n\n* On the food you purchase, the ingredients label should look like a recipe and not a science project. If you wouldn't keep sodium nitrate in your pantry, you don't need it in your chicken. \n\n* When ordering a salad out, dressing on the side. Restaurant dressings are often filled with more useless sugars and unhealthy fats than if you had just got the burger. Where possible, order a straight olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.  \n\n* Sugar is the devil. Some people process it better than others (from a purely aesthetic point of view), but frankly I would call it the worst thing for you in terms of health. Fruits and such are fine, but refined and processed sugars. Avoid. In all honesty, it's my greatest addiction and while I have it controlled, I don't have as much advice to offer as I'd like. I'd certainly be open to any tactics you all may have. \n\n* I highly recommend the book 'Thinside Out: Have your cake and skinny jeans too'. Being healthy and being obsessive compulsive can be a fine line that I am guilty of crossing to the wrong side of. Calorie trackers can be helpful or harmful. Weighing yourself can be helpful or harmful. I have helped and harmed with just about every tool given to me. This book is well-written and an easy read and it does a lot for me about breaking down the psychology of poor eating habits and emphasizing balance above all else. \n\n* For regular meals, I try and stick to things that live or grow (aka meat or veggies) and their 2nd or 3rd degree byproducts (aka yogurt, eggs, bread). Once you get beyond those (cereals, meal replacements) it's mostly crap with few exceptions. \n\n* I am not the master dietician or nutritionist -- I strongly encourage your own eating tips in the comments because these things are my passion and as a group that does prioritize self-care the way you do...I'm all ears!\n\n**Skin**\n\n* \/r\/skincareaddiction is a fabulous resource, but here is my overview that's quite simplified and has done me **oodles** of good. \n\n* Keep it simple. Don't get a gimmick cleanser, Cetaphil or CeraVe are 2 good brands to start with. Only use your finger tips. **Never** scrub with a wash cloth (just stopping that cleared my skin up so much). If your skin feels dry and tight after washing, that isn't clean --  that's your skin stripped of oils and it's bad. I like a light cleansing in the morning and a more thorough one at night. Though just one at night and a splash of water in the AM may be good for you. \n\n* Moisturizer. Always moisturizer, if you have dry skin - moisturize. If you have oily skin, it's likely your skin overcompensating for dehydration - moisturize. I like CeraVe in the tub. Any time you cleanse, moisturize right after. \n\n* Sunscreen, wear it every day, and thank me in 20 years (many of you do this but it can really never be said enough). Also, make sure you're wearing enough. I believe the suggested amount is 1\/4tsp (which seems like a lot) but that's how it's intended. \n\n* THIS MAY BE YOUR WHOLE SKINCARE ROUTINE. Cleanse and moisturize + SPF. Be gentle with your skin and that may do more for it than anything else. Less is more sounds shocking and contrary to every grapefruit, walnut core exfoliation, blah blah commercial -- but true. \n\n* Tea Tree Oil is great for spot control on budding pimples, be sure to dilute it though. I'll say: just doing the above for about 2 weeks only -- I bought tea tree oil and came home to try it...didn't have a single pimple to test it on. For my skin, that's crazy. I couldn't believe it. Most irrational disappointment beer, but true. I got to try it the next day though (of course), and it stopped that bad boy in its tracks. Tickle me impressed. I bought mine for $6.99 at Trader Joe's. \n\n* If you must exfoliate (which I must to get rid of those nasty little bumps), look into an AHA or BHA chemical exfoliant. They are much more gentle and uniform than physical scrubs. I'm not there yet, but quite looking forward to it. \n\n* Why am I not there yet? *Wait a minimum of 1 week in between start products*. It's really hard taking crap care of your skin, researching how to take better care of it, and not being able to do that all at once. Introduce one product at a time and change nothing else about what you already do. If you use everything at once and break out...you won't know what caused it and back to square one. I'm starting a new sunscreen this week and then a BHA next week. I'm really excited and have high hopes...but patience. \n\n* Non-facial care: AmLactin Lotion -- *omg*. It's a body lotion with the most gentle AHA chemical exfoliant in it. I use it on my body post-shower and I never believed my skin could be so smooth and beautiful. If you have any red bumps...run to Target and buy some now. It's very basic (and with skin care, basic is usually best -- keep it simple) and I love it. I've never had visibly pretty leg skin before (which is a curse after all the good exercise has done them) and now I couldn't be more enthused about wearing dresses. Note: it's a bit stinky, it doesn't bother me for too long but I warned you!\n\n**Dental Care**\n\n* You only have to floss the teeth you want to keep. \n\n* Seriously this section is the most straight forward: brush your teeth twice a day, floss every day, and after you floss rinse with a mouthwash. That's it. Your teeth will never be so beautiful\/healthy. Also, don't neglect your tongue. That's where bacteria really settle in, brush that guy too. \n\n* If this at all motivates you to floss (understanding why do something is always more helpful to me then how), here is why: it isn't to get crap out from between your teeth (though added benefit). That's where bacteria forms and think of them like a forming anthill and you stepping on them. Your preventing bacteria from making a home in your mouth and it's a battle to be fought every day. Do this and your whole mouth will be outrageously hygienic. \n\n**El Fin**\n\nI'll admit, when I started this guide I didn't intend for it to be so long. I hope despite the word count it is welcome and provides anything useful for anyone. Again, I can't emphasize enough, I would love any of your open tips\/insights\/suggestions for anything related to self-care. I'm quite passionate about it (as you can perhaps see).  \n\n***\n\nBelow I'll suggest a few more sections that I don't have any tips for, I'd love it if you gave your best strategies in the comments. \n\n***\n\n**Mental Health** \n\nI'm an anxious wreck and full-time stress ball in no position to offer advice to anyone. (Except exercise, that has helped me immeasurably and beyond words). I'm including the section though because it is important, and again, I really encourage any suggestions you ladies may have as I could definitely use it!\n\n**Time Management**\n\nDefinite an important skill that ties into the rest. How do you do it??\n\n**Sleep**\n\nSleep is an often-underrated part of the self-care process. There is quantity and quality in regards to making the most of it, and many of us (definitely myself) find ourselves lacking in one or both sections. If you wake up feeling amazing, please post how you do it!\n\n**Relaxation**\n\nQuite similar to mental health, and they definitely go hand in hand. But I think one is more long-term and the other is more \"how do you empty your mind for an hour or two?\" Mind is always buzzing and I can't shut it off. \n\n***\nHopefully some of you find this helpful, and some of you can contribute where I most certainly lack. \n\nCheers!","title":"Self-Care Megathread","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/3hbz82\/selfcare_megathread\/"}

I had no confidence and was a bitter person.\n\nThis sub opened my eyes. It has transformed me into a pleasant, amicable woman. I have since then dyed my hair, started wearing feminine clothes, stopped drinking, and just recently shredded my cigarettes into the garbage. I have embraced my submissive nature, and have become more soft spoken and feminine. I have also started working out, lifting and eating well. \n\nAt first when I found this sub, I was angry. I thought it was stupid, misogynistic...you know the drill. But I became obsessed with it. I read it every day. And eventually, all of the truths started to hit me, and I realized what I had to do.

I'd like to personally welcome you to RedPillWomen.\n\n**What's this all about?**\n\nOne of the main tenets of red pill understanding is that the dating\/mating\/marriage market is considerably broken. Now, on \/r\/theredpill, you probably hear guys bitch and moan because men's and women's mating strategies are at odds with eachother. They are, kinda.\n\nHere's the quick and dirty: We all have biological imperatives that our brains are programmed to try to make us accomplish in order to find happiness. The good news is, we're not slaves to the drive, and once we understand the drive we can be proactive to either satisfy the urge, or change our goals to mitigate it.\n\nA man's biological imperative is to procreate. Some men (the few-- less than 20%) are very attractive to women and may take on as many partners as he can. There's no telling if he'll stick around to help with the young, but rest assured he'll make the rounds. Other men aren't *as* attractive are happy being providers. This is a majority of men. They want to settle down, have a family. Their biological impulses, believe it or not, is to make a woman happy. It's both a feature, and as we've discovered on \/r\/theredpill, one of man's biggest weaknesses.\n\nA woman's biological imperative is to procreate. (We're not so different!) Her strategy is slightly different. She wants provisions, but she also wants the highest quality DNA to procreate with. Unfortunately for guys, this sometimes ends up with women having sex with one of the *attractive but noncommittal* men, and then finding another man to do the provisioning. Her strategy is two-fold: have sex with the highest value males as possible, and get commitment from the highest value males possible. If possible: get both in one man. If not, get both from separate men.\n\nThe reason for this drive for the absolute *best* DNA is because the biological cost for women is higher than men when making babies. It's a 9-month + many year expenditure. For men, it's about 15-seconds to half an hour (or longer if you're lucky, bow chicka wow ow). \n\nNaturally that means women cannot afford to \"accidentally\" end up with somebody of lower caliber, as this takes up precious time and resources that could be dedicated to higher caliber DNA.\n\nThis strategy, which is mainly unconscious, is called hypergamy: maximizing rejections to reach the best quality males as possible.\n\nNow, these imperatives we speak about here aren't set in stone, some have stronger instincts than others, and **all** men and women have the free will to ignore them. You **don't** have to give in to your biological imperatives. But know that left unchecked, most men and women will act on these imperatives without realizing it- causing visible trends that are easy to spot if you know what you're looking for.\n\nAnother point to be made is that blindly following your biological imperatives may bring you short-term happiness (that's what it's programmed to do!), but isn't necessarily the longest term happiness plan. In fact, following your instincts really only serves the purpose of making sure you make a bunch more of yourself.\n\n**So Why Red Pill Women? Isn't the red pill all misogynistic and stuff?**\n\nIt isn't. The red pill is about accepting reality for what it is. As you've seen above, men and women's mating strategies are at odds with each other, and a lot of men on \/r\/theredpill are a bit angry. But they're not angry because this is reality. They're angry because they spent a majority of their lives being told that this *isn't* reality, and putting them at a severe disadvantage.\n\nOnce we embrace what reality is, we find our relationships to be more successful, more fulfilling, and a better deal for ourselves *and* for the women we've dated. We've concentrated on what women like, and by doing so have been able to make ourselves into mates that women would want.\n\nBut what do women have to do?\n\nWell, the past half a century was the march of feminism telling women that they don't need to do anything for men, that they are perfect and don't need to change, that change or compromise is oppression, and that you can have it all. A career, kids, family, education- it's all yours.\n\nThe problem is that our culture ended up self indulgent with no long-term goals, and thusly- no long term happiness (at least where family is concerned).\n\nWith divorce rates skyrocketing, single motherhood increasing, never-marrieds piling up, and hook-up culture and one night stands at an all time high, people are reaching 35 going.. where's my family? \n\n**That's when Red Pill Women comes into play.**\n\nWe had a radical idea- what if men and women learned about their natures and took proactive control of them, came up with a compromise that made both parties happier in the long run?\n\nWe're a cooperative species, and great things can be achieved when we do. Women, you have the ability to find happiness when you embrace the reality of your biological urges and impulses. You have the ability and the requirement to become the optimal mate for your optimal mate. Do not believe the hype that you are *good enough* how you are, and realize that in life, the only things worth having take work. That's for men and women.\n\nRedPillWomen is self-improvement and long-term goal setting to maximize your personal happiness.\n\n**What RedPillWomen is and is not**.\n\nThe problem I've seen with female-based sexual strategy forums is that they inevitably focus on what's politically correct. They focus on tempering the message so as not to offend. Because ladies, like it or not, our entire culture currently revolves around *not offending you*. Seriously. That's today's culture.\n\nThis forum will embarce truth first and foremost, sensitivity be damned. While I encourage people to remain positive towards each other, plain insults are discouraged, I understand that sometimes the truth will seem like an insult. \n\nRedPillWomen is not the place for men to show up and spout nonsense. We have an unofficial rule on \/r\/theredpill that basically amounts to: don't listen to women about sexual strategy. It's not that we don't like women, it's that women really have a hard time seeing past what *they* like to understand men have a different palate. **The same goes for men**, perhaps even worse so. Men, being the less discriminating gender, are more-or-less programmed to find women sexy.. *no matter what*. And when a woman says, \"I like to eat pie with my fingers\" you'll have sex-thirsty guys line up out the door willing to say anything for female validation. \"I love women who eat with their fingers.\"\n\nTrust me when I say, this validation may feel good, but it's entirely useless if you want to find success in mating and in a family.\n\nMen will say anything for female validation. Men are utterly and completely blind when it comes to what attracts them. They are clueless. They are conditioned by society to tell you that things we're *supposed* to find attractive *are* attractive. And why not? In our minds, if I find you attractive, and you exhibit certain qualities, it's hard to isolate which qualities were the ones we found attractive.\n\nBut you're not looking for low-hanging-fruit. You could just walk into a bar with no clothes if you want to make men drool. But instead, you want to make yourself into the woman who will snag the highest value mate. You want to redefine high value to mean longest-term happiness. And you don't want just any old schmo to drool over you. So don't take schmo's advice. It's terrible.\n\n**Welcome!

OOP has stated she does not plan to interact with the RPW sub.*\n\nHey gals! I really enjoy when people do deep dives on this subreddit, so I wanted to add to the resources here. One topic I see a lot of interest about is leveraging pretty privilege to \u201cmarry a rich man,\u201d so I put together a loose guide on how to make that happen. Let\u2019s jump in!\n\n**What do I mean by wealthy men?**\n\nI am not going to attempt to teach you how to marry the absolute 1% of the 1% in wealth, because frankly I have no idea how. These people mostly marry each other. No, today we are talking about men who make somewhere between $200k and $1 million a year. Men in this cohort tend to have jobs in medicine, tech, finance, consulting, and law (in no particular order), though there are also some engineers, salesmen, specialized technicians, tenured professors, entrepreneurs, and others in this group as well. They tend to be highly educated, marriage-minded but marry late (the median age at first marriage for a man with a graduate degree is about 31), seldom divorce, live in urban areas, and come from well-off, intact homes. They are disproportionately white and Asian. They are in no way the end-all be-all of men, or of life goals. **My point is not the everyone should want to marry these guys, but a lot of women do** and are curious about what that would take.  \n\nHopefully I\u2019ve painted a good picture of the kind of man I\u2019m talking about. But what kind of woman does he marry?\n\n**Assortative Mating**\n\nOverwhelmingly, he marries a woman who is like him. Assortative mating, or the tendency of people to marry those with similar traits, including socio-economic status, educational and family backgrounds, and even physical traits, is one of the most robustly documented effects in sociology. High-status men have access to lots of beautiful women who are ALSO high-status, so why would they choose someone who only has one of those two things?\n\nPeople of different social classes also live in completely different worlds. They have different values, political and religious behavior, even different hobbies. They eat different foods. They increasingly live, work, and study in different places. They rarely interact beyond a superficial level, and anyway, most people want a partner they can relate to.\n\nSo, assuming you aren\u2019t yet a member of the upper class, how do you show a wealthy man that you are that kind of person?\n\n**Costly Signals**\n\nCostly signals are a concept originating in evolutionary psychology. They are actions that communicate something about you or your intentions and are difficult to perform or fake. These signals are trusted more as sources of information about a person, precisely because of this difficulty.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. There are more people who want to *appear* upper class than there are actual upper class people. Middle class people who want to fake being upper class might buy relatively cheaper \u201cluxury\u201d items (like fancy cars, or a designer purse), but they likely cannot afford to (for example) have an equally \u201cupper class\u201d house or hire a personal nanny for their children. If you heard someone had a row house in Brooklyn, you\u2019d be far more likely to believe they are actually wealthy than if you heard they have a Birkin or a Ferrari.\n\n**Practical Suggestions**\n\nNow that I\u2019ve covered the theory, let\u2019s jump into a few practical recommendations. I\u2019m going to alternate things you do and don\u2019t need to do as much as I can to keep it interesting.\n\nYou *DO* need to get an undergraduate degree.\n\nAs I discussed above, most wealthy men are very well-educated, and educated people marry educated people. The wives of high-earners tend to have at least an undergraduate degree (and often a graduate degree). School and work are also two of the top places where people meet their partners! If you want to meet a lot of men with medical degrees, the obvious places to look are medical schools and hospitals. You don\u2019t have to be a doctor yourself\u2014you could work in a hospital as a nurse, or get a different degree at a university that has its own medical school, for instance.\n\nYou *DON\u2019T* need to graduate from an elite university.\n\nLook, if you get into Harvard, you should probably go. But even among the very well-educated and wealthy, elite degrees are rare. And a potential spouse having a degree tends to be a much bigger factor than exactly where that degree is from.\n\nYou *DO* need to be financially stable on your own.\n\nWealthy men are less worried \u201cgold diggers\u201d than men who make less, but on the flip side, they are more likely to assume that the women they date will have their own money.  This is because almost everyone they know is well-off! They are used to women who are not impressed with their income. Also, although many wealthy men are happy having a wife who is SAHM, many of them actually prefer she works. Not every man who is wealthy is traditional.\n\nYou *DON\u2019T* need to be a high-earner yourself.\n\nThough they tend to be well-educated, the actual salaries of wealthy men\u2019s wives are all over the place. Many are doctors and lawyers themselves, but there are also a substantial number who are teachers or adjunct professors, social workers, psychologists, nonprofit employees, graphic designers and other educated and high-prestige but comparatively lower-income careers. You don\u2019t have to resign yourself to hundred-hour weeks to marry a doctor (thank God!).\n\nYou *DO* need to cultivate a wide and high-quality social circle.\n\nYou could be the most eligible woman in the world, but if you don\u2019t put yourself out there, you won\u2019t meet enough men to find a good match. If you want to ensure the men you are meeting are high quality, it\u2019s better to use social avenues that come with a built-in filter of some kind. That means school extracurricular groups, alumni clubs, social groups at your workplace, clubs and hobby groups in your (nice) neighborhood, that sort of thing. Many schools even have their own online dating sites that you can only access with a school email.\n\nMost people let a lot of their social connections lapse. But every friend and acquaintance is a potential avenue to meeting new people. Stop being someone who never texts first, and keep track of people whose company you enjoy on social media!\n\nYou *DON\u2019T* need to have a massive social media following.\n\nThat said, you don\u2019t need to be an influencer. Other posts on this sub have talked before about how this is a whole separate industry, one with significant overlap with sex work. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be an influencer (or indeed a sex worker), but the wives of wealthy salarymen tend not to have humongous Instagram followings. The pursuit of social media fame for its own sake is a distraction.\n\nYou *DO* need to look polished.\n\nPhysically, the wives of wealthy men tend to be thinner than average and fitter than average. Anecdotally, I have also noticed that women in the social strata tend to have very polished hair, perfect-looking teeth, and good skin. These are the costly signals of health, and health, and the language of \u201cwellness\u201d tends to be how upper class people talk and think about beauty. I can do a separate post deep diving into this if there is interest.\n\nPeople with high socio-economic status tend to be better looking than the average. Some of this is likely genetic (the result of generations of beautiful, successful people marrying each other). The rest of it is the result of being able to afford a healthier, lower-stress lifestyle, often combined with deep knowledge of personal grooming (among women, at least). \n\nIf you weren't born into high social status, pretty privilege is one of the best tools you use to fake it, since the halo effect leads people to assume beautiful people are higher-status than they actually are.\n\nYou *DON\u2019T* need to dress the \u201cold money\u201d aesthetic or wear designer clothes.\n\nIt\u2019s an open secret at this point that actual old money people do not dress like the TikTok micro-aesthetic. Not to mention, at this point \u201cold money\u201d is so played out as a trend that it basically means shopping for plain t-shirts and jeans at fast fashion outlets like the Gap. People who are well-off can afford quality clothing, and aren\u2019t insecure about showing a bit of personality.\n\nThat said, you also don\u2019t need a closet full of big brand labels. This is likely to come across as a fake signal of wealth, because while designer clothes aren\u2019t *cheap* at all, it\u2019s still an example of overcompensating within a smaller purchase category. This is why people often perceive this as \u201ctrying too hard\u201d in a distasteful way.\n\nYou *DO* need to adopt an abundance mindset.\n\nHigh-status men tend to avoid desperation and insecurity like the plague. You don\u2019t want to communicate with your body language or manner that you think he is better than you are, or that this is your once chance for happiness in life. You need to have your own thing going on, and build true confidence that if a relationship isn\u2019t working for you, you can walk away and find another great partner.\n\nYou *DON\u2019T* need to become the embodiment of femininity.\n\nSimilar to the influencer economy, most \u201cfemininity gurus\u201d are ether sex workers themselves, or stealing tips and tricks from sex workers (whose influence they often refuse to acknowledge). You do not need to behave like a high-class escort to marry a wealthy man. Most wealthy men do not marry their escorts. Again, I am not trying to shame escorts here, but they are pitching a particular service to a particular customer base. Their advice works best within that context.","title":"Repost: Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire \u2014 A Guide to Marrying Rich","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1h1lodn\/repost_who_wants_to_marry_a_millionaire_a_guide\/"}

I believe happiness derives from living life as your most authentic self, and dor me personally, I feel genuinely much happier and more at peace as I embrace my natural femininity and calm submissiveness (responsibly, of course) rather than feeling the need to control every situation; a trait which embodies the masculine.  I truly enjoy allowing myself to be vulnerable, feeling my emotions in the moment and empathizing deeply, wherein it becomes much more difficult to judge others too harshly.  In this journey, I've also come to relate much less to most modern-day feminists, the ones who unabashedly perpetuate hatred toward men, whether directly or passive aggressively.  For me, it's easy to see that this attitude is destructive and counter productive; even against the most misogynic man alive, rage and verbal retribution will make no positive change.  We would do well to put aside our own bitter projections and assumptions, often marinaded in misinformation and personal narrative bias.  I don't find masculinity intimidating, rather refreshing and intriguing that men live in an entire world unknown to me.  I love the natural polarity of strengths between masculine\/feminine, a beautiful duality to complete one another.   Accepting and respecting the differences between masculinity and femininity - instead of falling for the lie that I need to compete against what is masculine - has given me a profound freedom I would never have otherwise unlocked, and I've truly never been happier. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95","title":"Originally I tried posting this to r\/unpopular opinion, but apparently mentioning 'feminism' gets your post deleted \ud83d\ude14","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pyeto0\/originally_i_tried_posting_this_to_runpopular\/"}

This week we are covering the broad strokes of RPW and this post in particular covers the difference between what men and women are attracted to in the opposite sex.\n\n******\n\nA question about \"The 16 Commandments of Poon\":\n\nhttp:\/\/heartiste.wordpress.com\/the-sixteen-commandments-of-poon\/ cropped up on\u00a0\/r\/PurplePillDebate\u00a0and one of our regular denizens seemed a little appalled at them (understandable), so i started trying to think about how we reconcile an understanding that \"men\" are \"like that\" with the fact that men and women still seek to form relationships and at least try to be faithful to each other.\n\nTRP makes claims to be based on evolutionary psychology, and it is--but it is also based on what is referred to in political philosophy as a \"state of nature\". A state of nature isn't a scientific description of human behavior, but a fundamental first premise regarding human nature from which the rest of the philosophy flows. an example many people have heard is Hobbes' dictum regarding humans living without government \"the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.\"\n\nSo, what is the nature of humans in the state of nature according to TRP.\n\n> Male ephebephiliac polygyny--A mouthful. Let's unpack it. If Men existed in a universe where fully formed, hot 16-18 year old girls with long, silky hair and .7 hip-waist ratios grew out of the ground without agency, wants, needs and desires of their own and without families to care for and protect them, men would kill each other to collect as many of them as possible--replacing them with new ones as the older ones cycled out.\n\n\n> Female hypergamy--If 6'2\" 34 year old I-Banker millionaires grew out of the ground fully formed with no agency, wants, needs and desires of their own and no families to look after their interests--25 women would each chase and even consent to share the one that managed to make $1000001, while keeping a weather eye on any one who manages to make $1000002 as an option for jumping ship.\n\nWhy do these two statements sound both ludicrous and true at the same time?\n\nBecause humans recognize that we don't live in this world where the other people have no agency, wants, needs and desires of their own\n\nThat these two statements tell us\u00a0*something*\u00a0about human nature tells us nothing about the totality of human experience. In reality, we all have these kernels in the core of our sexuality, but on top of it we have a multitude of other factors. Our agency\/ego, looks, temperament, personality type, class, culture, social status, age, education--all of these things accrete onto that raw kernel like layers of a pearl. This individuation on top of a base common nature by sex is what causes the \"Sexual Marketplace\". We do not in fact fall from trees as the Platonic form of what the opposite sex wishes it could attain, and we do not live in a world in which others have no agency, wants needs and desires.\n\nWe live in a world in which we have a dynamic place within a shifting, everchanging sexual marketplace. At any given time a man or woman might be on the rise, at the peak, or in the decline of their sexual market value with regard to the opposite sex. Our market value is based on how closely we conform to the other sex\u2019s state of nature as possible\u00a0*within our bracket,* and this is key. A 50 year old poor man may WANT a 17 year old hot girl (as per nature), but he generally realistically understands he isn\u2019t going to get one and shoots for the most neotenous, slender, silky-haired youngest woman in his class, say, a 38 year old woman. A chubby, less than attractive 29 year old woman may WANT a 6\u20192\u201d 34 year old millionaire I-banker, but if she\u2019s realistic (another can of worms) she will likely shoot for what is in her class, a shorter man, a poorer man, a man with less options. This all accounts for why many people have a hostile reaction to many core TRP beliefs. They say \u201cbut look, fat, ugly people get together all the time and form couples\u201d, as if to disprove the core sexual nature of Man. Of course they do, but solely because we are ALL as humans trapped in a world delimited by our OWN features and viable options, not because even the ugliest, least attractive person wouldn\u2019t gladly take the MOST attractive possible person, the 10, if they could get it.\n\nThis discomforts people, it makes them feel bad about their place in the \u201cGreat Chain of Being\u201d of the SMP. This is understandable. But feeling bad about the world doesn\u2019t help you live in it. Recognizing the world for what it is and dealing\u00a0*graciously*\u00a0with your place in it, as well as putting significant effort into\u00a0*elevating*\u00a0your place to the best of your ability, does, and leads to greater overall happiness.","title":"Back to Basics September: Male Attraction v Female Attraction","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pls16i\/back_to_basics_september_male_attraction_v_female\/"}

Still, some couples calmly make up and apologize in the morning, while others have shouting matches of \"you always do this\" \"you drive me nuts!\" until 3am, every month. Some couples just need a night of  sleeping on the couch to clear their minds, while in others there is storming out the door, there are clothes thrown out to the dumpster, teary phone calls to friends and couch surfing. So how do you build a calm relationship, withot peaks of emotion? How do you even know what qualities to *vet for?*\n\nPart I:\n\nThere are a few factors which *you* need to respect and which you must vet for in *your partner.* No, you  cannot change him, though sometimes you can rationally explain things to him.\n\n1. You must both agree that relationship rules are not universal.\n\nBefore you ask yourself whether  you and your partner have the same rules, did both of you reach the conclusion that there are possibly different rules to be had?\n\nLet's say there comes the topic of you innocently chatting with a guy you once dated in middleschool, with absolutely  no romantic\/sexual intentions, but your man gets upset. There is a difference between him telling you \"that's cheating!\" versus \"I consider that cheating!\". One is dogmatic and one is an expression of their idea of fidelity and respect. Same goes for you! If your first thought is \"If you're my boyfriend it doesn't mean you police who I talk to!\" , that is dogmatic, demanding and leaves no room for discussion. If you submit to a dogmatic rule that you do not respect, you will be resentful. If he submits to your rule to not police you, he will be resentful and lots of chaotic fights will ensue in the future, even on unnrelated topics. If you discuss, however, what and why you constitute rule breaking, then you willl be harmonious, regardless of whose rules you agree to. If you stop talking to a certain man out of love, knowing that it breaks his masculine pride (or perhaps he smelled that your ex is a slime who pretends to be your friend), you will not suffer. Similarly, he can reach the conclusion that his jealousy spiked  up for nothing  (perhaps that ex from 10 years ago is married, lives in another city and only wanted to ask you about insurance). What is important is that both of you always have in mind that differing in viewpoints is not a *mistake*. One must not be \"corrected\", but you both must discuss and then *agree upon one viewpoint together.*\n\n2. Non-agression over tolerance (especially in the home)\n\nThis will come up  mostly when you are living together and the most common mistake is that a person will think that whatever bothers them shouldn't bother the other, which is not true. What bothers the man and what bothers the woman are two different things. Some people go into a cohabitating ltr\/marriage thinking they can do whatever they want and the other must tolerate it vs. some people go into it with the intention of building a relaxing home.\n\nLet's say you are used to having girlfriends over for coffee and gossip, but it annoys the hell out of your man. You think that his annoyance is trivial and you wouldn't be bothered if he had the guys over for beers in the evenings. If you built your home relationship like this, then do not be surprised when the other snaps and it all devolves into \"but you do this!\" \" yeah and you did that!\". Nobody should be bothered into their own home, so take your girlfriends to a coffee shop and let the man play his video games in peace. Similarly, he should take his boys to  the pub  or a barbecue and let you chill at  home. The same principle goes for anything: the one who does the *active* bothering thing needs to stop.\n\nThis is not about passive mistakes (eg. he leaves his dirty  cup on the desk), but about conscious and planned activities. You and him must consider the other first and build the home as a sacred place of retreat and the relationship as a relaxing place for the soul. If you ignore this and you are selfish, don't wonder why he snaps out of nothing. Be somebody  pleasant to be around. If *he* ignores this and becomes unpleasant to be around, explain these rationally, do NOT try to turn it around and annoy him back.\n\n3. \"Do not let your rage build up\" is *bad advice.*\n\nIf you respect 1 and 2, then the only things remaining to butt heads on will be trivial things and character flaws which might never be corrected. Perhaps he is messy, perhaps you are a bit of a shopaholic; it happens. We are encouraged, in this day  and age, to be [emotionally incontinent](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lct8ql2zoLo) , to constantly express how x and y makes us feel, as otherwise we will implode or something. I think we've all heard that advice thrown to us ladies, to tell our men of every thing that annoys us, to share our feelings, etc. \n\nLet's say you found his dirty socks on the living room floor *again.*  What happens if you just put the socks in the hamper and shut up about it? You will forget about it and be calm in five minutes. What happens if you tell him how much it enrages you or makes you feel disrespected? He will feel emasculated and criticised, not to mention that you just interrupted his activity. Maybe he responds with something *you*  did to annoy him, and then you defend yourself and ... there you go, now you have a one hour fight because of one pair of socks and he feels like going out for a few beers with the boys. Good job, girl.\n\nBut what if he snaps at you for every little mistake, making you wonder if you signed up for a relationship or a bootcamp? Do NOT snap back, do NOT bring up lists of his mistake from the past. You rationally explain that it is counter-productive to fight over every little thing; bad habits can be improved through discussion, with no need for emotion, rage and yelling. If he constantly makes excuses for his rage overwriting his reason (eg \"I just can't control myself!\") then be prepared for lots of fighting, because *he will not change.* \n\n4. Do not  insist on projecting \n\nEverybody projects, as we fill in the unknown gaps of someone's personality with the patterns we have found in  others. You can tell you are projecting if you are constantly afraid that he *secretly* does these horrible things for which you have no proof of. Ask yourself whether you believe if all men do x and y (like watching porn or cheating) behind your back. Make a thought diary and go back on it after one month to see how irrational you are, or perhaps see a therapist, otherwise you will be constantly suffering because of your own mind, next to a possibly perfect partner. You will feel a need to control him, to check his phone or other things, and just imagine how an innocent man feels when he figures that his SO secretly, actually thinks of him as a cheater or a liar. He will retreat into himself or run away.\n\nMen project too. I had a boyfriend who accused me of lying, despite me not lying about one single thing. He also suspected that I am upset when he goes out drinking beer with his friends, despite the fact that I actually loved to be home alone to chill. Some men have a healthy suspicion because of past relationships, which is understandable, but if you have gone beyong the point of proving yourself as impeccable and he still insists, then he will never change. Certain men just have pre-conceived notions that will not  budge with any ammount of proof. I would advise you to avoid these men (and I am not talking about a man who's a little RP aware; even the AWALT list of women's flaws is pretty short) or be ready to have constant fights. Do not try and make it your mission to \"prove\" to him that you are a unicorn who is different, because you will not succeed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart II to follow","title":"How to (almost) never fight (part I)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/p2ugat\/how_to_almost_never_fight_part_i\/"}

For the past few years I privately struggled with sex addiction via pornography, masturabtion and a hyper sexual libido contained in my relationship. Unfortunately, my sexual desires were taken out on my partner.\n\nMost of us exist in a culture which is already so hyper sexualised that we see behaviours that fringe on sexual addiction as normal. Even he who saw most of the toll on my self esteem, my womanhood and our relationship was in denial about my addiction. \"You're just a hypersexual person\" he would say - not being aware that hyper sexuality is a sign of addiction. \n\nAnyways back to what's happening now. I'm actively pursuing recovery and my behaviour has been improving during the past 3 years of my relationship. \nI credit this to my partners love and patience as well as constant readjustment of beliefs, behaviours and knowledge. \n\nTo supplement my knowledge I've been reading alot about sexual addiction, pornography, raunch culture and how pervasive sex is our culture. It's always been there but once you pay attention to particular issues you begin to see it absolutely everywhere.\n\nSo we in my relationship have decided to try and focus on the intimacy within our sex lives. This means no pornography, no masturbation, sexting only when he is away for work, avoiding sexual material in films etc and concentrating our sexual energy towards intimacy with eachother. Kind of making our sexual relationship somewhat sacred for eachother.  \n\nI'm kind of excited to take this approach. I hope this will contribute to my recovery and my relationship. Me and my partner have had very relaxed sexual attitudes towards eachother. Free reign on porn, masturbation etc and well we weren't any happier. Probably worse off. I have been feeling convicted (not necessarily religiously but potentially spiritual intuition) to move towards modesty (I cover up but tend to wear form fitting clothing  etc). \n\nReading about, seeing and experiencing sexual dysfunction within my relationship and with myself has shown me that alot of people suffer in this way but no one really talks about it? \n\nYou'll see on articles about how to be more sexual? Positions? How to satisfy your man? Etc. But no one outside of religious circles talks about intimacy. Being close. Being held.

I'm 25, so I'd really like to meet a man who is around 30 - 40 years old\n\nAs an added twist, I live in the bay area in California. So, quality men are much more scarce and have nearly unlimited access to plates galore.","title":"Are there actually decent guys on dating apps?

Congratulations!\n\nOr maybe you already are in a relationship and you want to shift to a more traditional, respectful relationship that honors both your strengths. *Lovely.*\n\nTraditional relationships are very structured and have very clear values and boundaries, which make it very easy to understand and practice in your life. It all goes back to biology and the natural strengths and talents of men and women, emotionally. While it is not an absolute, since there may be some exceptions and slight changes, the idea itself is the most important.\n\nI have covered traditional relationships in this blog for a while now, usually my own and you are welcome to explore and read through my accounts and thoughts, though they are all united by strong, clear values that I will bring together here, however, before I do that \u2013 we need to make sure that in your relationship, you have picked a decent man and that you two do share values.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TRADITIONAL VETTING \u2013 7 CHECKS**\n\nThis is done through **Vetting**.\n\n>*Vetting is the act of selecting a partner through the process of checkpoints and rejecting based on a direct conflict with those checkpoints or a lack thereof.*\n\nWhat are those checkpoints? Your values and admirable traits.\n\n**\\[\\]** [***Do your values match?***](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2018\/02\/23\/politics-values-you-just-gotta-match-em-all\/)\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this before, yet this requires reiterating for emphasis. For a traditional relationship to work, you both would need to believe in the honorable skills of men as providers and protectors and women as nurturers and carers of the home, prioritising home and family time over materialism and modernity. Of course, this means just as willing and skilled you are in the domestic area of life, he is also stable and believes in providing for you both and your future family. You respect each other\u2019s duties.\n\n**\\[\\]** ***Is he clear of unhealthy habits?***\n\nThis means that he looks after his health and his body, if you are not a smoker then of course, he shouldn\u2019t be either. Is he clear of any habits such as drinking excessively (or worse, drugs), excessive gaming\/technology or gambling? These are *big* red flags that should not be tolerated at all since they are a clear path to major problems down the line.\n\n**\\[\\]** ***Is he kind?***\n\nIndeed, this truly matters. How does he interact towards young children? Women and his mother? Is he polite and pleasant to speak to? If he frequently shows kindness and helps others (which is different from being a pushover), as well as you, then you have a good one in your hands.\n\n**\\[\\]** ***Is he true to his word?***\n\nWhen he makes promises and plans, does he commit to it? That shows how reliable he is as a man. If you want a future partner and husband to journey through life with and have a family with, he needs to be someone you can *trust and rely on*.\n\n**\\[\\]** ***Is he truthful?***\n\nMany people in the world are habitual liars and usually for all the wrong reasons. This is because they are committing wrongs that would damage those they love and only want situations to benefit them. If he lies to you and others in his life, this a heavy warning sign that you should not be spending your life with this man.\n\n**\\[\\]** ***Do you have the same relationship timeline?***\n\nTimelines matter since you would want spend the best of your time with each other, not waiting for the other to get a move on, or feeling as if you are being rushed. If your timeline to engagement, marriage and children match, that is a great sign. Otherwise, you would need to either negotiate or go your separate ways.\n\n**\\[\\]** ***Does he have decent friends?***\n\nYour friends, to some extent, define you. Obviously people spend time with their friends since they enjoy their ideas and in general, hanging out with them. If his friends are demonstrating many of these red flags as above, ask yourself as to what would stop your man from doing the same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS \u2013 7 VALUES**\n\n[***1. Respect Your Man, Let Him Lead (to an extent)***](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2017\/06\/28\/r-e-s-p-e-c-t-find-out-what-it-really-means-to-you\/) There is a reason why I mentioned vetting first. If your man is in the clear and proves himself to be admirable, true and loving, then he is worth respecting and he is obviously good at making decisions in his life. He had done so to get to the great place he is in and to become the good person he is now. When it comes to going out together (on a small scale) and major life decisions as a couple (on a large scale), let him lead and make the decisions BUT with your counsel. You are the first mate to his captain, he makes no move or decision without consulting you and compromising, if need be. Having your respect for his character and his ability to make decisions motivates a good man to do even better. In turn, this will also motivate you, then both of you would be striving to be better for each other.\n\n[***2. Have Faith In Your Man, Trust Him***](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2017\/07\/03\/trust-me-on-this-one-trust-your-man\/) Similarly to respecting your man, once he does make that decision, unless there is anything dangerous or seriously damaging or life-changing (which needs to be negotiated or compromised) then trust him and his decisions and let him learn from its success or failure. A woman\u2019s faith means so much to a man, it gives him the responsibility to do well for the both of you and if he is a decent man, having that responsibility is a great motivator for him to do his best and consider all aspects in making good decisions. Sometimes these responsibilities also bring pressure and if he needs your help and comfort, be ready to offer it. A woman\u2019s support is priceless. Just remember though, he needs to check with you as you are his second-in-command and advisor. Leaders who act alone are just tyrants.\n\n***3. Let Your Man Look After You*** Truly traditional men want to provide for and protect their woman. They want to make sure you are safe and have what you need. Men are physically stronger than women and this is the biology that has lead them to act this way. While this is diluted so much by the modern feminist brainwashing and delusion, encourage it in your man and appreciate how he looks after you by caring for him in turn. Appreciate what he does and don\u2019t forget to be grateful, sometimes that\u2019s all it takes to give him plenty of motivation in life. Knowing he has such a positive impact on your lives.\n\n[***4. Spend Quality Time In Simple Ways***](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2018\/03\/13\/quality-time-the-1950s-way-give-it-a-try\/) Part of being a traditional woman is to live simply, within your means without sucking away the joy of life. While you can spend money and enjoy yourselves, there are also simpler ways to have quality time. Talk together over cosy drinks, listen to radio shows while doing your own thing, be near each other and just have that space shared with one another. The strength of a couple\u2019s relationships also strongly relies on the little moments they share affection and time. The value they put into it, which is often lost in the modern rush of life.\n\n[***5. Don\u2019t Talk Negatively About Your Man To Others***](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2017\/06\/16\/its-not-harmless-chit-chat-zip-it-about-your-so\/) Simple as that. Unless you are seeking proper advice and think you can get some constructive criticism about an issue (or it is a very serious issue), don\u2019t vent about your man just for the sake of feeling good about venting. Not only does this paint a horrible picture of your man to your friends and acquaintances (who will then view and treat him badly), you will often regret it too. Sometimes we get caught in the heat of the moment, which happens, though for others they don\u2019t feel the heat you do so they will usually believe it permanently. Let some feelings pass or vent to a professional who will keep it confidential. Oh and also, if your friends acquaintances start thinking negatively about your partner, you then look like a *bigger idiot* for choosing to be with such a horrible partner!\n\n***6. Be A Place of Comfort*** In general, men have plenty of pressures in life- they are expected to be tougher than women, to be able to handle more and \u2018man up\u2019. For honourable men who need to protect and provide for their families, the worry of not doing well enough or fighting the obstacles and challenges in their career for that purpose can be exhausting. As women, we need to care for our men and be the refuge, emotional refuge they need to fall back on and regain strength from. This is one of the reasons [why I *strongly* discourage two full-income families](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2017\/09\/26\/why-i-believe-in-being-a-sahm-and-part-time-working-wife-its-time-that-truly-matters\/). With two careers both partners are constantly stressed and short in time, there\u2019s less emotional space to be a refuge and comfort if you yourself are under that weight.\n\n***7. Don\u2019t Compare Your Man To Others*** Comparing, while to an extent can be used as a motivator if there is genuine improvement needed, is not supposed to be a tool for humiliation. It is heavily endorsed now in the media (like in Sex & The City, Modern Family, etc) for women to degrade their men by comparing them to \u2018better\u2019 men, to make themselves feel superior and for a good laugh. Sometimes, they do it to directly humiliate and berate their men. This is harmful. Every human has their flaws and it\u2019s important to look at their individual flaws and work through them, out of genuine concern and in order to be a good partner to you and a good man for the family. That\u2019s the goal \u2013 not to become or be like someone else. Is he a kind and caring partner? Does he provide and protect? That\u2019s what matters, not his similarity to someone else. It\u2019s about what applies to you and your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note:** Since this is addressed to women, this article mainly focuses on what *you*, as the other partner, can do. Which is to make sure to check everything you need to check to ensure you pick a great guy and work your best to be a great gal for him as well. You can\u2019t change a man and you can\u2019t manipulate him either, so there\u2019s no point in telling you what to do to change him or what to do for him. You can only control yourself. In any relationship, good and bad things can happen, it is important to recognise in either party that bad things, including abuse, should *never* be tolerated. Unhealthy relationships that are based on manipulation and hurtfulness are abusive and should be left as soon as possible, seeking help is the vital first step. Two out of three abused partners are women and one out of three are men, it happens to both and I\u2019ve seen this personally. *Seek help*. Someone who doesn\u2019t respect you and care for you is no decent partner.\n\nTraditional vetting and relationships are not a quick and easy thing to talk about. There\u2019s so many values and points to focus on, though here I have tried my best to cover the main values and points of importance when it comes to vetting for a good partner. It\u2019s merely a rough guide. While it\u2019s also tailored for straight couples, non-straight couples can apply it how they like (I don\u2019t know enough about non-straight couples so that\u2019s your business).\n\nThe main idea is to respect and trust each other, once you\u2019ve determined you are both good partners and people. [Respect and trust is the scaffold for love](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2017\/06\/23\/what-is-love-baby-dont-hurt-me-just-do-these-other-things\/), since you accept each other and have faith in one another. This leads to a strong partnership in life and a deep connection. Attraction and excitement is only on the surface.\n\n*It\u2019s knowing you can put your lives in each other\u2019s hands and walk down that path together as one that creates a strong, lasting love.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Traditional love and living is not easy, though it is very much full of value and joy, you can find great fulfilment through the struggles and the quality time, with family and the one you love.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n([Original Post](https:\/\/thatstepfordgal.com\/2018\/05\/24\/dare-to-be-domestic-traditional-living-relationships\/))","title":"Dare To Be Domestic: Traditional Living & Relationships","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/a1d09b\/dare_to_be_domestic_traditional_living\/"}

They were highly intelligent women that men spent time with in addition to their wives, because in Japanese culture, wives were supposed to be maternal and responsible, not fun and games. Geisha were fun and entertaining to be around.\n\nHowever, this doesn't work for most modern cultures (even Japan nowadays). So I was thinking, it's so difficult as modern women because modern men do appreciate independence but they also hope for softness (which is lacking in most women nowadays). How do we accomplish this? By being a multifaceted woman.\n\n**HOW TO...**\n\n**Be a good girl:** This is what you should aim to be most of the time. A woman who is respectful to those around her, a woman who is responsible and has a secure sense of morals, a woman who has an inner happiness. Men like to have their fun but what will keep him around is your inner security. I've talked to many who claim they are wild animals until they find a woman worth taking care of. Invest in yourself, take responsibility for yourself - no matter how much we say men desire a \"helpless\" woman who needs him, men still respect a woman who is secure. You might say it comes from the childhood memory of having a mother who took care of him - ideal mothers are secure, responsible, understanding and warm-hearted, not frantic and chaotic. Make yourself happy first - take pleasure in the little things in life, practice gratitude, appreciate everything around you, have a good character and treat others well - this quiet confidence will keep him around.\n\n**Be a sexy vixen:** This persona is the fun and exciting side. *Keep in shape, mentally and physically.* Sexy is not just wearing makeup and high heels and having a bubble butt. Sexy is about being free, enjoying the moment, laughing, letting the emotions flow. THIS is what attracts men, not women who are constantly preoccupied and want their problems solved. Of course we cannot cover our problems all the time, but the key is *know when to put them aside.* Keep yourself mentally pliable, work on meditation and switching your brain from career\/mother\/responsible\/polite mode and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. Control your diet, go to the gym, go outside and get fresh air. Physical and mental health and directly related, so is your sex appeal! Lastly, sexy doesn't have to confined to the bedroom. This openness in your personality can happen at any time and anywhere.\n\n**Be a domestic goddess:** No matter what any modern man says about wanting a woman who has her own life and interests, homemaking is still held in high appreciation in men's hearts. Learn a few star recipes that you cook\/bake your best, then learn the basics of cooking. Learn about combinations of spices, cooking methods (grilling, steaming, baking, boiling, stir-fry), as well as pairings of vegetables-meat-grains. Follow a few recipes online and observe the cooking methods and flavor combinations so that you are able to cook a streamlined three course meal if necessary. For example, if I were cooking a Middle Eastern meal, I would cook lentil soup with pita chips, grilled meat with grilled vegetables and rice, end with dates and coffee.\n\nIron your own clothes, tidy up your room every day, buy organizers for your vanity table, nightstand, closet. Organize your wardrobe everyday. Make your bed every morning. You don't necessarily need to have frilly flowery throw pillows or expensive artwork but you do need to be neat. Men notice, trust me.\n\n**Be a best friend:** Friends learn from each other and are good companions. Educate yourself so that you can converse and debate on a variety of topics - your typical educated modern man *especially* appreciates a well-read woman. Have your own passions and expertise (usually better if it's different than his so you don't compete). That way you have something that is yours to take care and nurture. Have your own girlfriends to go out to brunch or shopping with, have your own list of books that you want to read, have your own hobbies that you develop. Your own passions will fuel his long-term interest in you, because remember...what do you have to offer? Who are you as a woman? Cooking and being pleasant is actually very easy to do, the difficult part is developing yourself as a woman.\n\nThat being said, I personally don't expect to be EVERYTHING for my boyfriend. He actually spends most of his time at work, with his guy friends, and at the gym. I don't see him very often, but when I do, I'm a combination of the above mentioned faces. When he comes to my apartment, I'm a sexy vixen and domestic goddess and best friend. When he takes me out for dinner, I'm a best friend and sexy vixen and good girl. When I'm with his family, I'm a good girl and best friend and domestic goddess.\n\nPlay around with these personas, discover them within yourself, and have fun!","title":"HOW TO: The Multifaceted RPW","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/75nj15\/how_to_the_multifaceted_rpw\/"}

She was, however, a remarkable and compassionate woman. And she was fiercely devoted to my father, so much so that five years after he died, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to even kiss the man who fell in love with her at the independent living facility where she lived for a year and a half before she too passed away. The man wanted to marry her, but it was out of the question. In my mother\u2019s mind, there was only one man for her. That he was gone and she was technically available was beside the point.\n\n>Despite my mother\u2019s allegiance to my father, she never quite mastered wifedom\u2014for one reason: she was wholly unyielding.\n\n>With my mother, everything was a fight. Everything was \u201cNo\u201d unless she determined it was appropriate to say yes. If my mother wasn\u2019t the one who made the decision, the decision couldn\u2019t possibly be good. Every so often she would appear to cede to my father\u2019s wishes, but only if she happened to agree with him.\n\n>Indeed, my mother was the quintessential alpha wife. An alpha wife micromanages, delegates and makes most or even all of the decisions. She is, quite simply, the Boss.\n\n>Every relationship requires a masculine and a feminine energy to thrive. If women want to find peace with men, they must find their feminine\u2014that is where their real power lies.\n\n>Alpha women aren\u2019t exactly new, but they were once a rarer breed. Today they abound. There are several reasons why, but it\u2019s in large part due to women having been groomed to be leaders rather than to be wives. Simply put, women have become too much like men. They\u2019re too competitive. Too masculine. Too alpha.\n\n>That may get them ahead at work. But when it comes to love, it will land them in a ditch.\n\n>Every relationship requires a masculine and a feminine energy to thrive. If women want to find peace with men, they must find their feminine\u2014that is where their real power lies. Being feminine isn\u2019t about being beautiful or svelte, or even about wearing high heels (although those things are nice). Being feminine is a state of mind. It\u2019s an attitude.\n\n>In essence, being feminine means being nice. It means being soft instead of hard. And by \u201cnice,\u201d I don\u2019t mean you should become a mouse. (That\u2019s the narrative the culture sells, but that doesn\u2019t make it true.) Men love women who are fun and feisty and who know their own mind! But they don\u2019t want a woman who tells them what to do. As a man named Chuck once wrote on my site: \u201cA strong woman is awesome. But she must be inviting and be able to mesh into an actual relationship. Needing to dominate and overpower, that is a no go.\u201d\n\n>Jackie Kennedy once said there are two kinds of women: those who want power in the world, and those who want power in bed. American women have become laser-focused on the former and have rejected the latter. In doing so, they\u2019ve undermined their ability to find lasting love.\n\n>The roles may have changed, but the rules haven\u2019t. All a good man wants is for his wife to be happy, and he will go to great lengths to make it happen. He\u2019ll even support his wife\u2019s ideas, plans or opinions if he doesn\u2019t agree with them. That\u2019s because a husband\u2019s number one goal is to please his wife. If he determines his wife cannot be pleased, that\u2019s when the marriage is in trouble.\n\n>Men are just so much simpler than women. Not simple as in dumb, as is often portrayed in the media. Simple in that they have far fewer needs than women do. What men want most of all is respect, companionship and sex. If you supply these basics, your husband will do anything for you\u2014slay the dragons, kill the beast, work three jobs, etc. Men will happily do this if, and only if, they are loved well in return. It is when men are not loved well that problems arise. That is the nature of the male-female dance.\n\n>Now I know what you\u2019re thinking: that I\u2019m putting everything on you. I am, and I\u2019m not. Your husband is 100% responsible for his own actions. If he makes stupid choices, such as getting repeatedly drunk, it\u2019s his job to own up to that behavior and stop it. Same goes for his emotional outbursts, if he has them, or his not coming home when he said he would. Or even his having an affair.\n\n>What I am saying is that men tend to follow women\u2019s lead. Your husband\u2019s actions are more often than not reactions. He\u2019s reacting to something you said or did, or to something you didn\u2019t say or didn\u2019t do. He\u2019s reacting to your moods, your gestures, your inflections and your tone. That\u2019s how men are. Your husband wants you to be happy, and when he sees it isn\u2019t working he thinks he\u2019s failed. That\u2019s when he acts out.\n\n>Another way to think about the male-female dance is to consider the game of chess. In chess, the king is the most important piece but also one of the weakest. He can only move one square in any direction\u2014up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. The queen, however, is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one direction\u2014forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. And how she moves affects how he moves.\n\n>As a woman, you can respond to this dynamic in one of two ways: you can resent it, or you can embrace it. I used to resent it. I\u2019d think to myself, How can I possibly make sure my husband isn\u2019t negatively affected by my every mood swing? I\u2019m a Pisces, for God\u2019s sake! My moods shift with the wind! Plus, why am I responsible for my husband\u2019s reactions? The whole thing seemed like a whole lot of pressure, not to mention unfair.\n\n>As a result, I embraced my alpha personality as though it were a baby in need of protection. If my husband chose me, obviously he likes that about me. Why should I have to change? Who would I be if I changed? And how could I be someone different, even if I wanted to?\n\n>But my alpha ways were bumping up against his alpha nature. We were like two bulls hanging out in the same pen together, and there was too much friction. And because I had zero interest in my husband adopting a more feminine role, I set about to become the feminine creature our culture insists women not be.\n\n>And here\u2019s what I learned: It\u2019s liberating to be a beta!\n\n>I\u2019m an alpha all day long, and it gets tiresome. I concede that I thrive on it; but at the end of the day, I\u2019m spent. Self-reliance is exhausting. Making all the decisions is exhausting. Driving the car, literally or figuratively, is exhausting.\n\n>It took me a ridiculously long time to get it.

You\u2019ve unlocked the code to keeping your weight in check. Even if you fall off the wagon (and you will), you\u2019ll know what to do to get back on track.\n\n>That\u2019s what it\u2019s like to love a man. Once you learn how, you\u2019re good to go.

I don't know what her SMV would *actually* be to men, but they certainly don't give her the time of day. She doesn't register on their radar, and I would guess her SMV is a 3 according to [this diagram](http:\/\/www.returnofkings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/pictorialscale.jpg). But regardless of where she is in the 1-3 range, she is solidly in the \"nope\" zone for most men.\n\nYet, she is happily married in the happiest marriage I have ever seen. She has a husband who is is a good provider while she is (mostly) a SAHM. He is charming, great around the house, a good father and a good leader. He is the type of man you can count on and trust. She loves and respects him, and together they make a pretty good team. It is a naturally red-pill, but neither of them are red-pill-aware.\n\nShe was able to get this man, despite being the same size the day she got married. But here's the catch, he is obese too.\n\nWhen I watch them, both of them are fully invested in their relationship. While *I* don't find either of them physically attractive, they do. Neither of them feel dissatisfied or short changed in their relationship.\n\nI tell this story, not to tell you about what is probable, because it may not be, but to tell you about what is *possible*. I've watched this relationship for a while, wondering if it defied the rules of The Red Pill. But it really doesn't, because while they are about evenly equated in SMV, they are also about equally equated in RMV. They are both realistic people who are not only *satisfied* with their life partner, they are thrilled. She looks at him and see someone she respects and admires, and he looks at her and see someone he cares about.\n\nIn The Red Pill, it is important that we do not ignore reality. In reality some people are low SMV, beyond their control. If what is making you less attractive is within your control, you should not take this as permission to not do something about it. But, if you are in the unfortunate set of people who have deformities that are unfixable, do the best with what you have but also be realistic with what you can get. Learn to look beyond someone's look for their value, and remember to have value beyond your looks. Your RMV is under your control, and if you are able to get that high, you will be able to get a relationship with someone with a high RMV. You may not be able to get a relationship with a hot doctor, but you could still be able to get the acne-scarred science teacher. As long as you are able to be positive and see his value, beyond his looks, there are many low SMV men who have great things to offer.\n\nTD;DR Don't give up because you're ugly.","title":"Low SMV and You","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5qjy94\/low_smv_and_you\/"}

He is 6'3, athletic, magnetic blue eyes, great blonde hair and smile. To me, he's a 10. A more objective assessment could be 8.5\/9, on a scale from 1 to 10\/runway model. Me on the other hand... I am a short woman slightly on the thick side (i.e. I don't look good in a bikini but am not legit fat) and my face is cute, I guess, but honestly I struggle to consider myself pretty. I'd assess myself as a 6.5, 7 on a good day. I have never hurt for a relationship, don't get me wrong. I don't get hit on, I don't get that much attention from men, but somehow I have in the past had serious relationship with 2 other men way hotter than me (>8.5 at the very least, one of them actually modeled).  I have no idea how I managed that. I do have a fun personality, I am very sweet, affectionate and loyal and am reasonably smart and very well read and educated, but I have swallowed the female black pill a long while ago. I know men don't really place much value on female achievement.\n\nNow, my current relationship is amazing. He is the sweetest man, great job, great dresser, he's just amazing. And somehow, he worships me. He is extremely affectionate and expresses his love to me multiple times a day. The only place where we have a mismatch is intellect, as he is more of a pragmatic, feet on the ground person while I am the more academic and bookish one. Other than that, he is the boyfriend tons of women would kill for. The sex is phenomenal. We cannot get enough of each other.\n\nEditing to add, that marriage, kids and growing old together are frequently and joyfully brought up, by him way more than me.\n\nStill when I look at the mirror I can't help but feel like I'm on borrowed time.

And then my brain starts conjuring up all these scenarios where one day he actually realises that he can do better and leaves me for one of the millions of prettier women than me.

If you have suggestions for any more additions, leave a comment.\n\n**Terms:**\n\n* **Alpha** \u2013 Socially dominant. Somebody who displays high value, or traits that are sexually attractive to women. Alpha can refer to a man who exhibits alpha behaviors (more alpha tendencies than beta), but usually used to describe individual behaviors themselves.\n\n* **Alpha Widow** - A woman (typically but not necessarily post-wall) who has been abandoned by an Alpha male. No matter how great her new man is, she will perceive him as failing to meet the standard of the alpha she was previously associated with. Due to hypergamy, a woman cannot date backwards, once she gets say, a male 8, she cannot date below a male 8 and be happy with him. If she does, she is just using said man for resources (BB) and doesn't really love him. Essentially, a damaged woman accustomed to a tier of man she can no longer attract. See \"Post-wall\" and \"Hypergamy.\"\n\n* **AMOG** \u2013 Alpha Male Of Group.\n\n* **AF\/BB** - Alpha Fucks\/Beta Bucks.\n\n* **ASD** - Anti-Slut Defense.\n\n* **AWALT** - All Women Are Like That. Often expressed after an example of hypergamy.\n\n* **Beta** \u2013 Traits of provision: either providing resources or validation to others, women (and perhaps men). Beta traits display low value to women if they are are put on too strong or too early in meeting- giving without equity. Beta can be used to describe individual behaviors, as well as people who have an overwhelming amount of beta properties (opposed to alpha).\n\n* **Blue Pill** \u2013 From The Matrix and its sequels. The path of conformity with Society\u2019s expectations; the state of being unaware of the problems engendered by society. Compare with \u201cRed Pill,\u201d below.\n\n* **CC, or Cock Carousel** \u2013 The period of time in a woman's life where she successfully exploits her sexual value and maximizes her hypergamous tendencies by having sex with as many alphas as possible. Usually happens between ages 18 - 27. Often ends when the woman hits the wall.\n\n* **Close** - The apex of an interaction. Often preceded by an indication of the type of close, eg. f-close (full close or fuck close, the interaction led to sex), k-close (kiss), #close (receiving phone #).\n\n* **Comfort Test** - Similar to a Shit Test, but meant to gauge a man's level of Beta traits. Typically only encountered in LTRs. While not discussed as often as shit tests, a successful LTR requires that a man pass these as well.\n\n* **Covert Contract** - An unspoken deal with terms the other party would never agree to. Most typically seen by orbiters trying to negotiate desire: \"If I do a favor for her, she'll go out with me.\"\n\n* **DT, or Dark Triad** - A combination of three personality traits: Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and Psychopathy. An effective short-term sexual strategy. \n\n* **DHV** \u2013 Display of Higher Value, the accomplishment, anything that improves your sexual market value in the eyes of another.\n\n* **DLV**- Display of Lower Value.\n\n* **DQ** - Disqualification. Used by women as an IOD. Used by PUAs as a method of disarming ASD by appearing to be disinterested.\n\n* **Dread Game** - Purposefully inciting jealousy in an LTR by openly getting attention from other women. Soft Dread is similar, but less open. With Soft Dread, the attention doesn't even need to be real. Creating the possibilty for female attention is enough to get the hamster going. (If you develop a great body, she knows that other women will find that attractive without having to actually see other women displaying interest.) The purpose of using Dread is to get the target (wife, girlfriend, plate) to step up their game to compete with other interested women.\n\n* **Feminism** \u2013 \u201dA doctrine built on the pre-supposition of victimhood of women by men as a foundation of female identity. In its goals is always the utilization of the state to forcibly redress this claimed victimization. In other words, the proxy use of violence and wealth appropriation. In whatever flavor, and variation, these two basic features are common to every doctrine using the label feminism. Feminism is therefore, a doctrine of class hatred, and violence.\u201d (John The Other, \u201cWhy not date a feminist?\u201d A Voice For Men, 4 June 2012.)\n\n* **Fitness Test** - See Shit Test.\n\n* **FR** - Field Report.\n\n* **Frame** - The context in which something is perceived.

The core mechanism that allows women to say one thing and do a different thing.\n\n* **HB** - Hot Babe (often followed by a number as an indication of ranking on a 1-10 scale).\n\n* **Hypergamy** \u2013 The instinctual urge for women to seek out the best alpha available. This is marked by maximizing rejection (therefore women are the selective gender). A woman will vet her alpha through various shit tests to ensure his \"health\" on the alpha scale. She is conditioned to recognize a declining alpha, as hypergamy also tends to continue seeking out higher status males even while with an alpha male. Shit tests allow her to prepare herself for eventually leaving when a new higher status male is found. If the male fails shit tests to a great enough degree, it will effect her feelings for him. He will effectively lower his sexual market value in her eyes. This will enable her to jump to the next male with ease and little remorse.\n\n* **Incel** - Involuntarily Celibate.

He obsesses about her, but she does not reciprocate.\n\n* **ONS** - One Night Stand\n\n* **Orbiter** - Also known as Beta Orbiter. A beta guy who accepted the proposal to \"just be friends\" from a girl he has oneitis for. He will stick around her and constantly validate her whenever she requests it.

Women tend to become desperate to settle down around age 28\/29, realizing they have limited time to secure a quality mate as their beauty diminishes. See \"The Wall.\"\n\n* **Preselection** - The idea that women are more attracted to men who already have the interest of other women. This saves the woman time in judging a man by using the idea that other women have already judged him favorably.\n\n* **PUA** \u2013 Pick-Up Artist.\n\n* **Pussy Pass** - Letting a woman off without actual consequences for illegal behavior. See \/r\/PussyPass for examples.\n\n* **Red Pill** \u2013 The recognition and awareness of the way that feminism, feminists and their white-knight enablers affect society.

On average, a woman's sexual attractiveness peak is in her early 20s, while a man's sexual attractiveness peak is a decade later. When a woman reaches the Wall, generally regarded as her 30s, she can no longer compete in SMV against the younger cohort of women. This can happen quickly after the peak or very gradually. See Post-wall.\n\n* **Trickle Truth** - A method of coming clean about bad behavior by only disclosing small pieces of truth at a time. \"All we did was talk,\" leads to \"Well we just cuddled,\" leads to \"I didn't mean to fuck him, it just happened.\" It's a hamsters way of saving face when bad behavior is discovered.\n\n* **Unicorn** - Mystical creature that doesn't exist, ie, the perfect girl.\n\n* **White Knight** \u2013 A man who \u201ccomes to the rescue\u201d of a woman, or of women, reflexively, emotionally-driven, without thought or even looking at the situation; (2) a man in authority who enables Team Women in his legislative actions, judgments, or rulings, reflexively, emotionally-driven, without thought or even looking at what\u2019s right.

This can take the form of *\"resume courtship\"* (attempting to appeal to men by showing or speaking of accomplishments or capabilities), attempting to attract a man's attention by competing with him (a real turnoff), or even *actually becoming angry* that men do not value her small business, her executive title, or her PhD. \n\nThis is a form of projection. While **women use a man's accomplishments to evaluate his character, but men do not**... they have other ways to do that which they prefer. \n\nWhy? \n\nSimple. Because *men like young women*. A 21 year old cannot meaningfully be evaluated by asking \"Does she have a PhD in philosophy?\", because no 21 year old does. A man who wishes to court her must find other ways of evaluating if she is intelligent enough to understand the world around her, a good conversationalist, and possessed of a sense of curiosity. He cannot simply ask \"has she built a business from the ground up?\" because she won't have done that, either... he must find other ways to evaluate if she resourceful, self-disciplined, and capable of sticking to a goal. \n\nSo, you might think that if you have a PhD, and your husband has a PhD, your PhD matters to him... but it doesn't. It didn't make him pick you. What made him pick you was the traits that enabled you to get it, coupled with the fact that he ran into you in that environment because you were there in the first place... that's how you met. \n\nTo understand this, it helps to hear a tale I was once told by a sports reporter. Apparently, the athletes' village at each olympic games is the site of a great deal of promiscuity. (Anyone surprised? Didn't think so.) But apparently the dynamic shifts as the games wear on, and more and more events are completed. As event results come in, female athletes begin to display a marked preference for male *medalists*. (Anyone surprised? Didn't think so.) But the instructive part is that the males do *not* display a corresponding preference. Female olympic athletes are highly desirable because they are pretty, healthy, energetic, and vital... but *it doesn't make a damn bit of difference whether they won or not*. The losers are still all of these things, and the men still seek them out. \n\nThe takeaway looks like this: \n\n* Men don't care about your victories, only the traits you used to get them. \n* Men don't use your victories to measure your traits or character. \n* Never expect a man to love you for your accomplishments, you will be disappointed. \n* Never build a resume for the sake of attracting a man. Only do it if you want it for some other reason. \n* Never assume you are unable to attract a high-status man because you lack the  accomplishments of other women in his life. All you need is the combination of traits he desires. \n\n","title":"Ditch the Resume","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9gyc8u\/ditch_the_resume\/"}

I share important strategies with women that will help them get what they deserve, in their love life, in their career, wherever they need it.\n\nYeah, right. Mr. Brian Nox, your personal white knight, is going to *treat you with the respect you deserve*, by giving you inside information on how *men are silly* and what you should do to get *everything you deserve* from them. \n\n*Just click here to buy his book.*\n\nI swear, if I ever get sick enough of working for a living to be willing to sacrifice my self-respect, I will take a fifty milligram dose of ondansetron hydrochloride, and start penning *\"Coughing Up The Red Pill: How I Rejected Misogyny and Discovered Women are Wonderful\"*, full of every platitude I can think of about how women are perfect, how anything they do wrong is men's fault, how they deserve a Nobel Prize and a Congressional Medal of Honor just for breathing, and how it is morally imperative that every man they encounter should devote his entire existence to satisfying their every whim, but never dare to speak in their presence unless given permission. \n\nThen I will buy a small Caribbean island, have a palace built on it, and never do any work again, unless flinging the ice from my martini glass off the balcony counts as \"watering the lawn\". \n\nBecause hordes of women will buy enough copies to kill a small forest, then read the first three chapters and collapse on the sofa in a drugged-out stupor of ego-gratification, oblivious to the babble of daytime television or the fact that their bag of potato chips has spilled into their unwashed hair. \n\nIn case my real point isn't totally fucking obvious, **anyone who makes money giving women relationship advice is really being paid to tell women what they want to hear**. \n\nIt must be quite tough to be a woman sometimes (and here I am no longer being sarcastic), because women are constantly surrounded by a perfect storm of misinformation, blowing from overprotective busybodies, and dudes who will say anything if they think they'll get laid. \n\nLet's face it: **If good relationship advice for women affirmed what they already wanted to hear, they wouldn't need any. They'd already know it.** \n\nAll growth, by definition, happens outside your comfort zone. This is common sense. If you want better results than you have ever had, you are going to have to learn things you have never known, think things you have never thought, and try things you have never done. \n\n**If advice tastes good on your tongue, spit it out. It's full of sugar and it will make you fat.** Anyone can make long lists of what they they deserve, and seek out people they can pay to agree with them. But if you think you deserve something, and the world isn't offering it to you, then it has a different opinion of what you deserve. \n\nAnd you can work hard to change yourself, or you can pay people to tell you the world is mistaken.

These girlfriends also had domineering aggressive personalities. They frequently fought with their husbands because they felt they weren't getting what they wanted in return.\n\nI remember I had visited one of those girlfriends a few years ago, when I was with my ex-boyfriend. My ex-boyfriend would always be helpful to me - taking my suitcase, opening doors, paying for me, offering his sweater when I was cold. My girlfriend would always be astonished and ask me how she could \"get one of those.\" It made me think...\n\nBasically there are two ways to get something out of your man: by demanding he does it for you or by inspiring him to do it for you. Inspiring him is soft power.\n\n**Have no expectations.** Be capable, but if he offers to help you, graciously accept. The common problem is women expect their men to do things for them all the time, so when he doesn't contribute, the women becomes a shrew and nags. For example: My friend is grocery shopping with her boyfriend. After checkout, she looks at him expectantly for him to take the bags. He grumbles and feels resentful. However, if you take the bags yourself, he may or may not offer to help you. I find that most boyfriends do, if they see you doing it yourself. But the key is to have them offer to help you, not to expect (or direct) them to help you.\n\n**Make your boundaries clear and then STFU.** It's high character for a woman to have boundaries. Men also prefer you to have boundaries because they don't actually want to walk all over you - that's reserved for plates. But there's a huge difference in how you set them. For example, let's say you're anti-smoking and your boyfriend smokes, but he knows he should quit. Instead of nagging at him every time he takes out a cigarette and telling him how disgusting it is, tell him you don't like smokers and then STFU. Next time he smokes, don't say anything but make subtle reactions such as waving smoke away from you, or not kissing him if he has cigarette breath. This is soft power. Nagging is not.\n\n**Don't give him a reason to not offer something to you.** This mostly coincides with nagging and resentment. If you're a peaceful serene woman who doesn't give any trouble, it's actually very easy for men to want to help you. If you've emasculated him or controlled him in some way, he doesn't feel tender toward you. This is the easiest soft power, you don't have to do anything!!! I often just sit on the couch watching TV while my boyfriend is working, then he'll offer to take me out. I never ask him. But my girlfriend whines that her boyfriend is boring by staying home then her boyfriend is angry and feels like he has to owe her by taking her out. See the difference?\n\n**Be maternal in your chores but not your actions.** OK, so men want someone who's nurturing, we all know that. But how can we be nurturing without being too motherly? Here's the trick: be maternal in your chores (cooking, laundry,) but don't ACT maternal. This means don't ask him how he feels, don't run to solve his problems, don't hug him like a child, don't organize his daily agenda for him. Most of the time when a man wants a nurturer he really means acceptance, because his mother accepted him. When you start reminding him or controlling him, you've moved from girlfriend to domineering mother. Just take care some basic chores to contribute to the household and let him figure out his life on his own. Making him feel sexy and admired is number one, not wiping his shirt when he has a stain on it.\n\n**Vet, vet, vet.** This may be the most important thing to remember: A truly masculine man is giving and generous. If he was not actively taking the lead when you met and also throughout your courtship, he is not a true masculine man, or at least *not to you.* You **must** hold out for a good match\/chemistry if you wish to have a successful relationship. Don't just look at his job, his salary, his physique, his hobbies - look at if he likes making decisions. If he doesn't like making decisions and waffles frequently, guess what, he won't change. And he most likely won't lead. For soft power to work, you need a truly masculine man who likes making decisions. And you should love him for the man he is. He doesn't like going out, but you do? Don't expect him to offer to take you out even if you're being soft and feminine. It's not who he is. Accept him or move on.\n","title":"Soft Power","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5v41he\/soft_power\/"}

Husband and wife sitting back to back on the bed. He says he needs more sex to love, she says she needs more love to have sex. So who's right?\n\nI personally don't care who's right so I won't attempt to answer that question. Why don't I care who's right? **Because it doesn't matter**. It doesn't help the marriage when one of the two are deemed to be right on this issue. What absolutely does matter is the stalemate caused by this vicious cycle that someone needs to break. It is on this that I will focus today, within a marriage as well as dating. Let's begin. \n\n**What is sex?**\n\nWell, I'll assume that most of us know what sex is. For the purpose of this discussion, I will consider anything sexual within the realm of sex. \n\nSex has many levels. Sex in it's ultimate state is fully naked, penetrative, finishing insider her, kind of sex. This is called intercourse. There's non penetrative sex which some like to call outer-course. There's non orgasm sexual gestures, touches and flirtations of all kinds. All this is part and parcel of human sexuality. \n\n**What is intimacy?**\n\nIntimacy is a deep connection you have with another person. In [a previous post] (https:\/\/redd.it\/51oknp), I explained the difference between the intimacy of friendship vs sexual intimacy. Just like there are various levels of sexual contact, so too, there are various levels of intimate connections. \n\nIt is the hope and dream of many people to have a sexually and intimately fulfilling relationship with their spouse. The only question is what comes first, the chicken or the egg?\n\n**Men and women - sex and intimacy**\n\nMen and women tend to approach this topic from opposite directions. While it's true that some men may fit better with the description of women that I'm about to describe and some women may fit better with the description of men, the descriptions which I will describe here speak about the majority which are what can be considered masculine and feminine character traits even though masculine women and feminine men do exist. \n\nIn life in general and sex\/intimacy in particular, the masculine way is to see a picture first and then focus in on the details. To see the forest first and then the trees etc. The feminine way is to see the details first and build up to the picture, to see the trees first and then realize there's a forest. This often happens within a split second and isn't always noticeable. **Neither approach is right or wrong, they're just different**. \n\nWhen it comes to sex and intimacy, this works in the same manner. For a man, it all starts with full on penetrative sex and from there it trickles down into all the smaller details. The more quality\/quantity of sexual activity, the more love, kindness, patience, caring and attention to all the little details he will be motivated to engage in. **For a man, sex leads to intimacy**.\n\n**(Of course, I don't speak here about people who have one way relationships. I speak only about relationships where both parties sincerely wish to invest 100%)**\n\nFor a woman, it's the opposite. You start with the small gestures and connections and build your way up all the way to the big thing. Many women need an emotional connection to have sex at all, even more women will have difficulties maintaining full sexuality if there is a lack in intimacy. **For a woman, intimacy leads to sex**. \n\n**How to break\/avoid the stalemate in dating and marriage**\n\nDating first - in dating, the female approach needs to be taken. What do I mean by this? \n\nWhen dating a person for the purpose of building a home, a family and a life together, you must establish a certain level of intimacy way **before** you take off your pants. It's utterly crucial to work your way up from the smallest intimate connections all the way up to eventually having sex when your relationship is already solid and you're both firmly committed to one another. This method of starting from the small things and working your way up, is the female way as mentioned above. Doing this the male way would mean sex on the first date and we all know how good that is for a LTR....\n\nIn marriage, it's the opposite. Most of the time. When he complains about not enough sex, what he may be really saying is this - \"I really want to be very intimately and deeply connected to you, but I need sex to make that happen\". This may sound ludicrous to many women but it's true nonetheless. Many women will counter with - \"what does that even mean?!?!? You need to have sex to have an emotional connection? I need an emotional connection to be interested in sex!!!\" While this is true from her perspective, it won't help him nor will it change his perspective. Yelling at him or pointing out how wrong his perspective is will only alienate him further. This will likely cause him to withdraw and no one wins. \n\nTruth remains that he needs frequent and meaningful sex to maintain his deep intimate connection with you. It isn't only about sex. If it was, he would have never married you, he'd have stuck with pump and dump girls. He married you because he needs something more than just sex. He needs intimacy. He obtains intimacy through sex, but the sex is just the first step for him even if it's the last step for you. **He starts at the top and comes down from sex to all the smaller forms of intimacy, she starts at the bottom and ascends up from small intimacy all the way to sex**. \n\nWithin a marriage, each person needs to continuously invest 100%. In this case - he needs to continuously invest in the little connections and she needs to continuously invest in the bigger, sexual connections. It may be just as challenging for him to keep his engagement in the little connections on the up and up as it is for her to keep her sexual connections on the up and up. If you and your SO are never challenged with any of this, good for you. If you are (sometimes) challenged with any of this, read on. \n\nWhat happens when life happens and things get out of sync. One day you wake up and he's not happy with the quantity or quality of sex. She counters that she doesn't feel intimately connected. How do you break the stalemate? Contrary to dating where it's crucial to start with the female way, here, in marriage, it's crucial to start with the male way. This means starting with an increase in quantity and quality of sex, thus allowing the intimacy to follow. If done with an open mind and an open heart, **you will succeed!**. Here's why....\n\n* Sex is more quantifiable than intimacy. If you want things to change, the more you can quantify, the better. \n\n* When you begin with sex, you covered something big. The result will be a big increase in the bigger elements of intimacy even if the smaller elements will take more time. OTOH when you begin with the small elements and work up to sex, it may take a really long time to get anywhere meaningful. This can lead to burnout. \n\n* Being sexually active often leads to an increase in sexual desire. It's a win win. OTOH investing more in intimacy without the sex can come at an emotional cost. The more he invests (as making the first move to break the cycle), the more he's likely to resent. \n\n* If she has responsive desire, it's a good idea to allow him to turn her on. Again, it's a win win.  \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nWe try not to be tit for tat in our marriages but there's a point where we will all begin to feel that we're investing a lot and receiving very little in return. This point is toxic. \n\nA man will feel used when he invests too much emotionally and it's never enough to get her in the mood for sex. \n\nA woman will feel used if she invests too much in sex and doesn't receive the emotional connection she craves. \n\nThe way to break the vicious cycle is to begin with a higher frequency and quality of sex. Why, is explained above. \n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n","title":"Sex and intimacy, intimacy and sex.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5s5i4u\/sex_and_intimacy_intimacy_and_sex\/"}

Vetting is part science and part fine art. It amazes me how many people put little to no effort into selecting the correct partner; it is everywhere in their vague dating site profiles (\"Just ask!\" That's the entirety of so many profiles!), their vapid, inconsequential date conversations, and the hard life lessons they must reenact, yet never *learn from* in their own lives as evidenced in advice spaces everywhere. \n\n**The higher the man's value, the more competition a woman interested in him faces from others.**  You can't change this reality, but it can be offset and mitigated, for **the higher the woman's value, the longer she can keep a man's interest through a courtship and vetting process... *but never for TOO long!***  Despite the time and market pressures that bear on this equation, there is much a woman can do to improve her vetting process so it's not like a blind leap of N-count faith, nor a cynical game of [iterated prisoner's dilemma](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) that never seems to yield mutually positive outcomes.  \n\nThis post comes in three parts.  In true Red Pill fashion we'll start where we have the most power and control by vetting *ourselves.*  Part two delves into the details of vetting men.  Part three looks at vetting for the ideal mix of Alpha and Beta traits.\n____\n\n## Prepare and Vet *yourself* first!\n\nTo obtain the commitment of the best man possible, you have to make sure your *own* house is in order, and have a realistic self-image and expectations.  Improve yourself as much as possible, on an ongoing basis; really KNOW who you are and what you want in a man and relationship, and make sure your image **as perceived by men** is what you want it to be.\n\n**Begin with the end in mind.**  Know what kind of relationships you want, and what kind you don't want, in broad terms.  This should help you cleave away large swaths of possibly attractive, but ultimately unqualified men, without hesitation or remorse.  You owe it to *yourself* to find the best partner, which means you don't owe weak matches any of your precious resource of time.  Success at this is far easier to aim for and obtain when you know and understand yourself: your true likes and dislikes, your entrenched patterns, biases, and weaknesses.  When choosing a life partner, try to take into account how your needs and tastes will change over time as well.  Will the qualities you find so attractive in a college boyfriend work well in a Captain, Husband, Father?\n\n**Make sure your picker is calibrated well**  If you always seem to find yourself attracted to the \"wrong kind\" of guys, you're also subconsciously *rejecting* the right ones.  It's Red Pill canon that *you CANNOT negotiate attraction,* and this is true on the individual level.  You can't start with someone who has good partnership qualities on paper but you're not attracted to, and work or will your way to attraction.  However, you can unlearn your blue pill ideas, and overwrite entrenched maladaptive patterns by various means, from introspection to therapy to pushing out of your entrenched comfort zone by sheer willpower at first.  Over time, you can dramatically steer the TYPE of men you are subconsciously attracted to.  \n\n**Be realistic about your own SMV**  It's like The Price Is Right:  You want to bid as high as you can, *without going over.*  Women can generally \"date up\" a point or two in the sexual marketplace, so don't undersell your potential.  A dangerous reality of the SMP is, compared to women, **men will SLEEP with a much lower SMV woman than they will COMMIT to.**  If you try to punch too far above your weight, it becomes easy to get used and dumped.  Guile and skill may land a higher-than-expected partner, but simply offering easy sex will probably work AGAINST gaining his commitment.\n\n**Be aware of your RMV or what you bring to the relationship table** and never stop learning and improving!  Your SMV or appearance is good for *attracting* men, but high Relationship Market Value is what high quality men are looking for in a keeper.  Looks will fade, but relationship skills can be built upon and finely tuned throughout life.  How highly would *men* rate you on factors like conversational\/listening skills, empathy, conflict resolution, domestic and childrearing skills etc?\n\n**Preselect with good filtering processes**  With all of these details to attend to, it's easy to see how vetting fatigue can set in when you're actively seeking a relationship and find yourself churning through many poorly matched prospects.  There's a powerful business rule that applies here, which is not obvious to new entrepreneurs and inexperienced daters alike:\n\n> If you find yourself with more business than you can handle, RAISE YOUR PRICES at once!\n\nIn a dating context, this means if you find yourself overloaded with prospects that never go anywhere, *raise* your standards and the bar to date you.  Add more polarizing details and qualifiers to your dating site profile.  Try new, improved places and methods of meeting people and phase out current ones aren't delivering *any* qualifiable candidates.\n\n**Leave room for serendipity** when implementing a tight, goal-oriented search for a high-quality partner.  This is not meant to contradict, but rather temper the above advice.  I mention this because so many successful couples arose from individuals who would never have expected \"on paper\" to make a good pair.  Don't be lax about red flags, just make sure your preconceived notions don't disqualify an unexpectedly great match.\n____\n\n## As you become more self-aware and improved, and develop keen insight into your OWN value and appearance to the men in the dating marketplace through rigorous self-vetting, you improve your ability and effectiveness at [vetting and choosing a man.

You\u2019ve read the popular posts. You\u2019re ready to start surrendering and being a great first mate! The problem? Your husband isn\u2019t stepping up. You feel defeated. Why isn\u2019t this working?! It *must* be him. He isn\u2019t leading like the sub said he would. \u2018How do you fix this?\u2019 You ask. \n\n\nFirst and foremost, you can\u2019t change your man. You also can\u2019t demand he be the leader and take charge. For one, he probably won\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, and for two, that\u2019s called leading from behind the scenes or topping from the bottom. This is not true surrendering, not true following your captain\u2019s lead. So how do we do it? Men are simple, straightforward creatures. They don\u2019t understand subtle or even **obvious** hints. So cut it out, and stop being passive aggressive when he doesn\u2019t get it. \nOne of my favorite manosphere bloggers, Ian Ironwood, wrote a great article about [encouraging men to lead:](http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2013\/02\/girl-game-extend-invitation.html)\n\n> It\u2019s not that these dudes are duds, understand. In almost every case they are good, decent, kind men who have dedicated themselves to their families and their wives. It\u2019s not that they lack devotion, understand \u2013 most are filled with good intentions and a deep-seated desire to succeed. What they often lack is understanding.\n\n> Oftentimes these men have grown up cowed, with distant or absent fathers and strong, sometimes even domineering mothers. They have been taught by society that their masculinity is a stain they must overcome, and they approach their duties as father and husband like *penance*, not a *prize* hard won.\n\n#**Taming of the Shrew**\nDepending on how shrew-like you have been in your marriage and for how long, you have contributed to your husband\u2019s betafication. So first and foremost, let\u2019s make sure that we have fixed that problem. Always be working on yourself, putting your best foot forward, not nagging, always encouraging, sweet, helpful, a good first mate. Even one slip up in a heated moment can tear down what took him a month to build up.\nProgress can be slow, based on your husband\u2019s beta tendencies in general, how long\/how bad your lack of submission contributed to the problem, and how quickly you internalize RPW. Please remember that this is your husband\u2019s journey, not yours. Don\u2019t rush him or goad him into progress. That will not work.\n\nBased on articles written by Ian Ironwood and the book The Surrendered Wife by Laura Doyle, here are my tips for encouraging your husband to lead you and your family!\n\n\n#**Don\u2019t phrase it as a question** \n...Rather a statement.  \u201cI\u2019d like to know what you want for dinner.\u201d Men are used to deferring to their wives\u2019 wishes and whims in the interest of equality. When you phrase something as a statement rather than a question, you make a decision his. You are deferring and he is put in charge of a decision. Laura Doyle says that if he tries to hand you back the reins, you should simply reply, \u201cwhatever you think,\u201d each time he tries to do this. I did this with my husband as he was shopping for his car. It works for any situation! For dinner plans, for buying a car, anything!\n\n*Example 1* \nRPW: I\u2019d like to know what you want for dinner.\n\nDH: I don\u2019t care. What do you feel like making? \n\nRPW: Whatever you\u2019d like.\n\nI will add that your Captain\u2019s personality type (greater beta, alpha, sigma etc) greatly affects the way his leadership emerges and how it appears. It will take you knowing your captain to flesh out whether he is **still** trying to kowtow to your authority or if he is actually delegating. In the beginning, depending on the degree of beta and how long\/how bad the dynamic has been in your household, your husband will most likely be more blue pill and inclined to let you lead but as your relationship evolves, you will need to use your judgement about which situations he is actually delegating to you. \nWives may have to surrender a lot at first to fix a husband who stopped leading in the face of her prior overdominance. However, over-submission can become a burden to the relationship once he starts taking control of more areas of life and delegating certain ones to his First Mate.\nInstead of offering open-ended questions to the Captain about tasks delegated, a good First Mate will offer her Captain choices that contain the information he requires to make a decision.\n\n*Example 1a*\nRPW: (knowing there is ground beef) Would you like beef stroganoff or meatloaf tonight for dinner?\n\n*Example Two*\n\n DH: We have an extra $200 this month. Should we pay down debt or put it into the savings? \n\nRPW: Whatever you think is just fine with me, babe!\n\nDH: I'd really like your input though, especially since you make the payments.\n\nRPW: We have about $XXXX in savings and $XXX with 18% interest on the credit card.\n\nAfter the decision has been made, you can\u2019t criticize it. This can be the most difficult part, especially when he makes a decision you don\u2019t like. You don\u2019t like what he picked for dinner? Shut up. Think you should have paid off the credit card? Shut up. When you make the decision to make it his decision you have to leave it there. If you take it back and say \u201cI think we should do it this way,\u201d or \u201cNo, I don\u2019t like that,\u201d it makes him feel as if he has failed some sort of test in your eyes. Once again, he can\u2019t do a single thing right to please his wife. I like to ask myself \u201cis this the hill I want to die on?\u201d which is basically me asking myself how important this decision is and is it worth potentially tearing down my man by questioning his decisions and setting your captain-first mate dynamic back who knows how long.\n\n#**\"But what if he messes up?\"** \n\nIt is not a matter of *if* he will mess up, but rather *when* he will mess up. He is guaranteed to, he is human. You mess up too, sometimes really badly, he just most likely doesn\u2019t rake you over the coals about it. Each time your husband makes a mistake he is learning. He feels the responsibility and any associated feelings (humiliation, fear, failure). He needs a soft place to land, a supportive and loving wife. I know some women are thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to be upset? His decisions affect *me*!\u201d \n\nSure you are. But you don\u2019t get to rip him a new one. You *do* get to help him dust himself off and watch as he fixes the problem. When he messes up, do not jump in to help. Do not reassume control. This will be hard, especially in the heat of the moment. Resist the urge! Let your husband figure it out for himself. Laura Doyle wrote something that resonated with me early on in my RPW journey: \u201cYour husband manages to communicate, problem solve, and produce in his job. Clearly he has the skills to do the same at home.\u201d What a simple yet powerful notion! He is capable!\n\n#**Encourage an Alpha Presentation**\n\nIan Ironwood also uses this suggestion for encouraging your husband to [assume leadership:](http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2014\/09\/girl-game-encouraging-your-captain-to.html)\n\n>Simply put, a way to quietly encourage a man toward a more Alpha presentation is to put him in situations in which you would like him to display Alpha, and then quietly invite him to do so without judgment or rejection.\nYou can do this in a number of ways. He goes on to tell a story of when he and the now Mrs. Ironwood were dating, she asked him to come along with her to her father\u2019s house to drop off a gift for him. She included that he may have been drinking and that she would appreciate his company in case things got out of hand. What sort of man can refuse a favor like that?! She asked him to go as her protector. Men love feeling needed for the masculine abilities and protection is a huge one. \n\nHelen Andelin, in *Fascinating Womanhood* lists the traits men love to be noticed and complimented on: \n\n * his masculine body\n\n * skills and abilities\n\n * achievements, goals and dreams\n\n * masculine traits of character \n\n * his masculine role\n\nWhen trying to tailor a situation to your husband that would quietly encourage an alpha presentation, look for ones that will highlight these subjects and you\u2019re sure to get a win.\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nAs you continue with your RPW journey, please remember that not all men are alike and not all men are alphas. There is a wide spectrum of male personalities and truthfully not all of us ladies would do well with an alpha. My husband is a man I would classify as a \u201cgreater beta\u201d. He is someone who possesses leadership qualities however he will not step up if someone else is willing to hop in the driver\u2019s seat. The hardest part for me was to overcome the tendency to dominate him and keep myself in my own seat. At first I was disappointed because I thought red pill wouldn\u2019t work for us. But then I realized, I am judging DH based on what I think a leader looks like and how I would do things if I was leading. I need to watch him and how he leads, which is super laid back and almost looks like he isn\u2019t at all. But he does, in his relaxed, undemanding way. I just have to learn to stay out of his way.\n\nGood luck, be patient, and don't give up! This journey is so worthwhile! \n\n~Sadie\n\n","title":"What To Do When Your Captain Won't Lead","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4tafpv\/what_to_do_when_your_captain_wont_lead\/"}

The man is a genius. I was recently going through some of his posts on his blog and I began re-reading the series he wrote called \u201cWife Tests\u201d. Now, Ian writes mostly for the male perspective but this series is helpful not only for men but also to women. There have been a few posts from lurkers or new posters asking about ways to improve their girl game or to up their game for future or current relationships. This series will be super helpful for RPW\u2019s new and experienced to read as it serves to instruct and remind us of everything we could be doing. I encourage every lady to read this series but as Ian is a tad verbose at times, I\u2019ve added my own Spark Notes version here. Enjoy!\n\n*Please note that when clicking on the links, Mr. Ironwood has retro pin-up-esque photos peppered throughout his posts, some of which may not be appropriate to view at work or around the presence of children. They are not pornographic by a long shot but some are definitely risqu\u00e9.*\n\n * [Red Pill Alerts:](http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2013\/09\/wife-test-red-pill-alerts.html)\n\nThis first article is a litany of phrases or utterances that can and should throw up red flags to men vetting a potential partner. \nThe first and most obvious red flag to everyone here should be a woman using the term **\u201crape culture\u201d**. \n\nAnyone uttering this phrase without a trace of humor or sarcasm will most definitely turn into a raging fem-nazi once the honeymoon period is over in a relationship. I don\u2019t feel a need to harp on this phrase for any length of time as I\u2019m certain we are all aware of how over used this phrase is among the feminist army. Fellas, stay away from this kind of woman, ladies, do not be this type of woman. You will nail yourself a low value beta using this mentality as any captain worth his salt wouldn\u2019t touch you with a ten foot pole. \n\nThe second \u201cred flag phrase\u201d is **\u201cdelicate male ego\u201d**. \n\nThis one should also be relatively self-explanatory. If a woman doesn\u2019t respect a man, *all* of a man (including his ego) he will not be properly satisfied in a relationship. Everyone has an ego and everyone loves to have someone else build them up (particularly if that other person is attractive).  To be a woman who not only won\u2019t build him up and stroke his ego (no matter how silly you personally may think it is) but will actually *tear down* his ego (and thus sense of worth in a relationship) is not an ideal candidate for a wife. \n\nThe third and final example I will pull off the list is the phrase **\u201cI want to work on my career\u201d**.\n\n Now many women, especially those newer to RPW may prickle at this being a red flag. Practically all women today assume (wrongly) that being highly educated will add to the sexual attractiveness. This is not the case. Men may be impressed or think you accomplished, however a fancy degree or a fancy job do not add to your SMV at all. In fact, Mr. Ironwood postures that it is a red flag for women to say \u201cI want to work on my career\u201d and I can see why. If you and a potential mate are on one of your first dates or just getting to know each other, you are essentially telling him that your career comes first, before anything, including him. No man wants to hear that. \n>\u201cA woman who sees herself as a professional first will only see herself as a wife and mother second.\u201d\n\n * [A Good Worker:]( http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2013\/11\/the-wife-test-good-worker.html)\n\nI purposely listed this article after the last bullet point because the two seem to conflict with each other. They do not. Mr. Ironwood clears up this seeming hypocrisy by explaining:\n> \u201cBeing \u201ca good worker\u201d isn\u2019t just an evaluation about her employment status and potential, it\u2019s an evaluation of her character when you broaden your scope to include old-fashioned housework and industry in general.\u201d\n\nBasically this article is discussing what to look for in a woman to ensure that she is not lazy or simply looking for a man to take care of her, rather she is someone who will do a fair share of the work and also care for her man. This is a rather important green flag us ladies will want to fly high when being vetted by a potential man! \nWhether your goal is to stay home after marriage and\/or children or continue working, there are a few things you should keep in mind now to ensure you are sending the appropriate signals. \n\nFirstly, a woman who won\u2019t work is obviously a red flag. But almost as big of a turn off is a woman who doesn\u2019t know when to stop working or forgets why or who she is working for. \/u\/SuperSlavisWife just posted a fantastic article a few days ago entitled \u201cLaissez-Faire Homemaking\u201d in which she tells of the dangers and pitfalls of trying to make your home perfect all the time. One such pitfall is becoming a tyrant in your own home. Insisting on perfection all the time puts your husband and kids on edge and does not make the home a happy, inviting place. Such a woman has forgotten whom she is working for. Who are you intending to serve by homemaking? Your answer should be \u2018your family\u2019. They shouldn\u2019t be being terrorized for the sake of the picture perfect home. So while it is important to not sit on the couch all day watching *The Price is Right* all day, it is also important to not become \u201cMonster Stewart\u201d. \nFor those women who are in the work force, it is important to remember that you have a family and to save some of yourself every day for them. Careers are important but not as important as your marriage and your family. \n\nSo how can single ladies demonstrate their ambition and industriousness? Ian answers this in the form of questions men should be asking themselves. Read the full list on his blog but a few of them are:\n\n * Does she ask for help even if she doesn\u2019t need it? (Laziness)\n\n * Does she try to get you to do her work for her? (Laziness, manipulation)\n\n * Does she have a hard time planning the project? (Lack of ambition, trouble planning for the future, laziness)\n\n * Does she clean up after herself?\n\n * Can she stop the job short of perfection? (knowing when to stop working)\n\n * Does she take pride in the work she does?\n\n * Does she need you to watch and\/or act as a cheerleader for her efforts? (validation-seeking, low self-esteem, attention seeking)\n\nThese and the other questions listed are important in determining in ourselves the message we are sending to our men. I encourage you to read the list and answer honestly, using introspection to identify potential places of improvement within yourself.\n\n *  [Domesticity:](http:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2013\/11\/the-wife-test-domesticity.html)\n\nThe final wife test I\u2019m going to touch on today is \u201cdomesticity\u201d. \n>  One of the things a man seeks and finds value in when he is looking for his wife is someone with whom he can make a home.\n\nWhat a surprise. A man wants a woman who knows how to make a home an inviting, warm, soft place to land. Unfortunately because of the feminist movement eschewing any sort of activity related to feminine homemaking, it is a dying art. I myself had no idea how to add special little touches to my own apartment (and worse, I didn\u2019t realize they were missing!) My mother-in-law was the one who taught me the importance of homemaking and what an art it truly is. She showed me how a table cloth and some candles make dinner more special, how fresh flowers placed in a simple vase dress up a window, and overall how these small touches contribute to a house feeling like a home. It is definitely an art many women nowadays do not know how to create. \n\nLittle things Ian encourages men to look for in a woman\u2019s home (and thus little touches you can add to yours) are listed in their entirety on this blog post. A few include:\n\n * house plants \n\n * cat\/dog \u2013 how well are they cared for, groomed, the attention paid to them (all relates to you being able to dote on another living breathing creature. If you don\u2019t want a pet please skip this suggestion!)\n\n * general d\u00e9cor \u2013 does your house give off a warm, cozy feeling or does it feel like you cleaned out the sale section of Target? Are the pieces original and cohesive to give the house an overall feel or  is the paint and decorations discordant? \n\n * is the trash and\/or laundry piling up \u2013 obvious housekeeping skills \n\nThat\u2019s all for now, I thank you for reading and hope that these articles will be helpful in stepping up your girl game for your partner, either current or anticipated! I\u2019ll post part two in a few days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n~Sadie \n\n\n\nEdited: formatting","title":"The Wife Tests","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4rwfcj\/the_wife_tests\/"}

Even when he's not telling the story just right, or it's just the two of us at home. \n* I've actually started listening to him when he talks. I didn't think this was that big of a problem until I made the change. I'd just tune him out and half listen. Super rude. \n\nAnd I missed a lot when I tuned out. Because now - I'm seeing how he leads this relationship. Leading the relationship does not mean he meets a set criteria of Alpha Traits. That was my misconception in my very first post. \"Why won't he do A, B, and C, all good leaders do those things!\" (Again with the grass is greener...). Leading means he is his own man. That he respects himself. \n\nSo now that I'm listening properly to my husband-to-be. What am I hearing?\n\nI'm hearing him discuss how his buddy at work is getting a new car. Not so much that Coworker is getting a new car - but Coworker's Wife is selling his car, giving him her car, and getting a shiny new car. I'm hearing Fiance say \"This won't happen in our relationship. I make money, I'll buy the car I want. You do the same.\"\n\nI'm hearing him discuss how his groomsmen broke up with his girlfriend over religious differences. I hear him say \"He needs to stand up for himself, because either she's bluffing and she'll stop this, or she's not and that's not something they can fix anyway - they would be happier apart\" \n\nI'm hearing how justified his frustrations are with my hypocrisy in bed. \n\nI'm hearing him say \"I appreciate that you take care this and that, I have other things on my mind.\"\n\nI'm hearing him say \"This is how I'm going to handle that\"\n\nI'm hearing him delegate, I'm hearing him relax, and I'm hearing him laugh a lot more now. \n\nThis was never about Fiance not leading, this was always about me being a selfish twat. Admitting this was my problem is not the same as accepting and doing something about it. I'm thankful for the ladies in this group who have provided harsh advice from the beginning. I'm thankful for my captain, my future hubby! Now the only thing to do is to *show* him daily I am thankful. \n \n","title":"Actually listening to Him was the best thing I could do for our relationship","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/321cm9\/actually_listening_to_him_was_the_best_thing_i\/"}

Respect his judgment\nThe men were really touchy about this. A man deeply needs the woman in his life to respect his knowledge, opinions, and decisions\u2014what I would call his judgment. No one wanted a silent wallflower (not would I advocate that!), but many men wished their mate wouldn\u2019t question their knowledge or argue with their decisions all the time. It\u2019s a touchy (and difficult) thing in these liberated days, but what it rea3lly comes down it is their need for us to defer to them sometimes.\n\nSeveral men confessed that they felt like their opinions and decisions were actively valued in every area of their lives except at home. Some men felt that their comrades at work trusted their judgment more than their own wives did. Also, while a man\u2019s partners or colleagues will rarely tell him what to do (they ask him or collaborate on the decision instead), more than one wife has made the mistake of ordering her husband around like one of the kids.\n\n`2`. Respect his abilities\nAnother strong theme that emerged was that men want\u2014even need\u2014to figure things out for themselves. And if they can, they feel like they have conquered something and are affirmed as men. For some reason, spending hours figuring out how to put together the new DVD player is fun. Problem is, we want to help them\u2014and guess how they interpret that? You got it: distrust. (It\u2019s a wonder any relationships work and that the human race didn\u2019t die out millennia ago!)\nAnd, of course, our attention is not all benign. Sometimes we truly don\u2019t have confidence that our man can figure something out on his own.\n\nThe little things equal one big clue\nWe don\u2019t realize that the act of forcing ourselves to trust our men in little things means so much to them, but it does. It\u2019s not a big deal to us, so we don\u2019t get that it\u2019s a big deal to them. We don\u2019t get that our responses to these little choices to trust or not trust\u2014or at least act like we do!\u2014are interpreted as signs of our overall trust and respect for them as men.\n\nA man might think of it like this: If she doesn\u2019t trust me in something as small as finding my way along a road, why would she trust me in something important, like being a good breadwinner or a good father? If she doesn\u2019t respect me in this small thing, she probably doesn\u2019t really respect me at all.\n\nThe next time your husband stubbornly drives in circles, ask yourself what is more important: being on time to the party or his feeling trusted. No contest.\n\n`3`. Respect in communication\nWomen hold an incredible power in the way we communicate with our men (both husbands and sons) to build them up or to tear them down, to encourage or to exasperate.\nSome things just push a man\u2019s buttons. This goes beyond what we say\u2014such as questioning a man\u2019s judgment or his abilities\u2014and into how we say it (and where we say it, which is the subject of the next section).\n\nThe disconnect\nIn my interviews, a large number of men said something like this: \u201cWhen my wife says something disrespectful, I often think, I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t know how that makes me feel!\u201d I had to reassure these men over and over that their wives probably didn\u2019t mean to disrespect them and were likely just clueless.\n\nLet me give you several common examples of how a man might hear something negative where the woman never intended it.\n\nHearing disrespect\nNot long ago, I was asking Jeff and one of his married colleagues about the dynamic of men wanting to do things for themselves. This man said, \u201cSomething, if something breaks in the house, I want to try to take a crack at it before I call an expert. If my wife says, \u2018Well, you\u2019re really not a fix-it-type person,\u2019 I feel so insulted. She\u2019s not rude about it or anything, but it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t respect me enough to believe that I can figure it out if I put my mind to it, even if it takes me a while.\u201d\n\nHearing disappointment\nIn a survey\u2014as in life\u2014a sizable minority of men read something negative into a simple female reminder. I asked men what would go through their minds if their wife or significant other reminded them that the kitchen wall was damaged and it still had to be fixed. More than one-third of these men took that reminder as nagging or as an accusation of laziness or mistrust.\n\nCrank up that filtering system\nNo matter what we think we are saying, in the end, what matters is what the guy is hearing. Obviously, some people can be overly sensitive, and we can\u2019t walk on eggshells all the time. Nor do we want to pass up all opportunities to help them understand our communication writing.\n\nAfter all, don\u2019t we want our husbands to adjust to our sensitivities? Do you want your husband to publicly tease you about gaining ten pounds? It\u2019s all about loving each other the way the other persons needs to be loved. Even as we help our husbands understand that we have a learning curve on this, we should make every effort to filter our words through a \u201cdisrespect meter\u201d before they pass our lips.\n\n`4`. Respect in public\nNow we come to one of the most important points of the book. There appears to be an epidemic of public disrespect for men, and the biggest culprit is not the television, movies, or other media, but the women who are supposed to love their men most.\n\nThe most fragile thing on the planet\nDozens of men told me how painful it is when their wives criticize them in public, put them down, or even question their judgment in front of others. One man on the survey said that they one thing he wished he could tell his wife was that \u201cat a minimum, she should be supportive of me in public.\u201d That wish was repeated dozens of times on the survey\u2014it was one of the strongest themes that emerged.\n\nConsider this statement, which I have heard (in essence) from many men: \u201cMy wife says things about me in public that she considers teasing. I consider them torture.\u201d\n\nBe respectful even when he\u2019s absent\nHaving seen how important public respect is to men (it is almost impossible to overstate), I have become incredibly sensitive to how often we might talk negatively about them behind their backs. The effects are much the same even when a man isn\u2019t present: The women\u2019s disrespect of her husband becomes even more deeply embedded as she harps on it, and those in listening range may begin to feel the same!\n\nShowing public respect goes a long way\nJust as your man will be hurt and angry if you disrespect him in public, he will think you are the most wonderful woman in the world if you publicly build him up.\n\nTrust me\u2014from the men I\u2019ve talked to, that will be the equivalent of his coming home to you with a dozen roses and a surprised date night without the kids. He will feel adored.\n\n`5`. Respect in our assumptions\nUnfortunately, in one area men have every right to read something into what we say\u2014and that is when we have jumped to negative conclusions about them. When we really examine our communication, we\u2019ll be astounded at how often is assumes something bad about the man we love. See if any of these assumptions ring a bell.\n\nWe assume, \u201cHe needs to be reminded\u201d\nTo us, repeatedly asking \u201cHave you done it yet?\u201d is probably not a big deal. But inherent in the question is our assumption that the guy needs the reminder\u2014that he is either incapeable of remembering on his own or that he remembers just fine but needs our prodding to do the job. What they are accurately hearing is \u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d\n\nJust realize that his reason for not doing it may be different from yours. Remember, half the men on the survey indicated that sometimes they just have different priorities. OR they could just be unable to handle one more thing. One man with a stressful job noted that he sometimes feels like a computer that will crash if he tries to load one more thing onto it. For him, procrastinating on something his wife wants him to do at home is his warning sign that he will emotionally crash is he tries it.\n\nWe assume, \u201cHe\u2019s choosing not to help\u201d\nOne experienced female marriage counselor gave me this example: \u201cIf my husband doesn\u2019t help with the kids or the cleaning, I shouldn\u2019t assume that he sees it and is choosing not to help. I should start with the assumption that he doesn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nWe assume, \u201cIt\u2019s because of him\u201d\nFinally, sometimes something is not his fault\u2014it\u2019s ours. Sometimes we assign unloving motives to our men that could actually be traced back to something we have inadvertently said or done. For example, a wife who is constantly critical of her husband may spur him to withdraw emotionally to protect himself, thereby becoming unloving where he wasn\u2019t before.\n\u201cMen are not stupid,\u201d says Dr. Eggerichs. \u201cThey are not Neanderthals. Sometimes these behaviors that appear to be unloving are not unloving at all. They are reacting that way because they interpret something as disrespect. Even if something they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n","title":"The Five Respect Needs of Men","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2cvqgh\/the_five_respect_needs_of_men\/"}

For many years I have been very masculine and did not fully realize it until recently.  When I was a child, I pushed my natural femininity away as a means to protect myself and to fit in.  \n\nIn October 2023, I shaved my head and maintained a buzzcut for 6 months and began growing it out in March.  For the longest time, I had the urge to buzz my hair off and that time with the buzzcut got the urge out of my system.  I do not regret having no hair, as I got to experiment with something unconventional and it helped awaken me back to femininity.  \n\nDuring the buzzcut era, I began college and lived in the dorms for a few months.  I was drinking more than usual, \"friends\" with some questionable people who did not have my best interests in mind, and overall felt just OFF. \n\nReflecting upon this time of my life, I realize that the buzzcut was a \"suit of armor\" because I was afraid of being vulnerable or soft.  I felt empty and the weight of the world on my shoulders.  Even my body language was more masculine and I really felt the heavy energy in my shoulders and upper back. \n\nI am in a new semester and moved out of dorms, and am doing significantly better.  I reduced a lot of the stressors in my life, and stopped any associations with those dorm friends.  I take long walks every day and have been noticing the flowers for the first time in my entire life.  \n\nOver the past two weeks especially, I feel like something just clicked in my brain.  This desire to be feminine and live softer.  I picked up journaling again, and I bought some new clothes (white and light blue instead of navy and black).  I stopped biting my nails, and am now painting them again (classic red) which I absolutely love.  I like my face without makeup, but I started wearing light makeup to accentuate my natural beauty.  I feel so much more free and alive then I have in years.  \n\nI actually used to make fun of red pill and trad communities, and while I do not agree with everything about them, I have found a lot of solace in lurking in this community.  It feels like I am now truly ready to live as a woman.  I used to be a hardcore feminist, and while I firmly believe that women should be allowed to choose their path in life, I have really awoken to how much of a capitalist sham that modern feminism is.  The glorification of sex work, to the point where young women are starting on OF as soon as they are 18, is revolting to me.  I hate the discouragement of femininity, like it is a weakness of some sort.  I remember in elementary school, amongst the girls it was like a race to see who was the most tomboyish.  I also disagree with the \"I am a strong independent woman.  I don't need men.\"  Men and women are complimentary to each other, and we need each other.  \n\nAll my life, I have struggled when it came to relationships with men.  I have always been the chaser and stepped into a more dominant role, and quite frankly, I am sick of it.  During my time at dorms, I got briefly involved with a couple different men, both of whom did not respect me as a woman or person, and tried to go way too fast physically for me.  I have always wanted to get married, but for the longest time thought that my only hope was mere hookups.  Over the past few weeks I have really come to terms that hookup culture is not for me, and I am specifically dating to get married.  I have been single for a few years, but for the first time I feel true contentment with singleness until I find the right man.  \n\nEven in this past week of looking more feminine (despite having a pixie cut), I have had so much more positive attention from men in public, and I feel so attractive.  I feel so much more at peace and content with myself and who I am.  For the longest time I felt older than I actually am (and not in a good way) and I am finally feeling my actual age.  \n\nSo while I am new to this community of like-minded women, thank you all for your posts that have inspired and affirmed me.

I am a longtime lurker here. Recently, I ended things with my boyfriend of about 1.5 years. Things were quite literally perfect with him, we had so much in common, loads of fun together, and I loved him very deeply. \n\nUnfortunately, I am in my early 30s and know for a fact that I want marriage and kids in my future. We had had a few discussions previously about this, and it seemed the general consensus was to take things slowly. I figured I had told him what I wanted and planted the seed so to speak, and we could take our time and let the relationship flourish. I genuinely thought that maybe I was rushing\/pushing him by talking my about this and needed to let it be his decision. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago. I was considering removing my BC device because some complications it was causing. I told him about my plans, and reminded him that we would have to figure out a workaround so that I didn\u2019t get pregnant. Somehow the topic of the future got brought up again, and I asked him what he felt his timeline was for marriage and kids (as much of a chill girlfriend as I want to be, I needed to know this info). \n\nMy boyfriend replied that, while he does see himself getting married and having kids, he wants to date more (other people), before marriage. I was floored. I ended things right there in a fit of shock and internal rage. To further add fuel to the fire, he said that he wasn\u2019t really enjoying our chemistry in the bedroom anymore, and didn\u2019t feel comfortable committing to me because of this. Wow. Double whammy.\n\nI am 30, with a college degree and a good job.

Furthermore, I don\u2019t want to settle for someone just because they want marriage. Ideally I would want the relationship to progress organically to that phase - which I thought was happening with my ex boyfriend this time around. \n\nI am tired and feeling defeated. \n\nTl;dr - Are there men who still want marriage?

She moved in to the space about a month ago. The day she moved in my husband came home to tell me how much I would like her. \n\nThe next few days he and she were talking more, he mentioned that I came down with the baby rabies last year and am really looking forward to starting a family. We had loosely decided to start trying to conceive in April. \n\nShe immediately started saying in no uncertain terms that everything we wanted to do is not good. She said that I would of course have to work because if we divorced I could screw him over for a lot of money. My plan was and still is to stay at home while the kids are young. \n\nShe said that 23 is really young to come down with baby rabies. She non stop talks about how expensive childcare is and how expensive raising a baby is (I am extremely frugal, only shop thrift). She tells him how hard it is to raise children and how if we knew how hard it was we wouldn't do it. \n\nShe says that anyone who wants to have a large family (like I do, always have, that's why we are starting so early) is crazy and ill advised. \n\nAnd finally, my husband invited me to lunch with her and her husband where she said all of the above things to me directly. Every time I talked about being excited to have children she would say something nasty to me, even had the audacity to ask me how I planned on paying for all of my children and insinuating that me staying at home is a burden for my husband.\n\nMy husband has, since meeting this woman a month ago, cooled on the idea of starting in April, which we are ready for, so that I can work for an extra year. This may be irrational (I don't think it is) but I think she is telling him that me wanting to stay home with our kids is a burden for him. \n\nSo I walked back to my husband's office with her to drop hubby off and we haven't had a chance to talk. He does know that I don't like that he's joking about me having baby rabies with her and that the comment about us divorcing (seriously, what the fuck) is ridiculous. He also seemed very uncomfortable at lunch today. \n\nMy question is, how should I proceed respectfully. I am struggling to contain my frustration in this circumstance. I want to start trying in April like we had planned, and I don't want to fight bitterly about this. \n","title":"Woman in my husband's office meddling in our relationship","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/a34ohi\/woman_in_my_husbands_office_meddling_in_our\/"}

Some of these are conscious, others are not. \n\nThe essence of communication is the transference of an idea from one place to another. From one person to another, from thoughts to paper and from the subconscious to the conscious (and many more). The human body is continuously communicating various messages between the limbs and organs. \n\nInterpersonal communication is when a massage gets passed from one person to another. These messages are sometimes verbal, sometimes non verbal. Some will say that the majority of human communication is nonverbal. \n\n**Mixed messages** \n\nPeople become confused when the verbal and nonverbal messages don't match up with each other or worse, when they outright contradict each other. Being that actions speak louder than words, people are more likely to believe your actions - your nonverbal communication - and disbelieve your words. This is tolerable here and there but will certainly lead to a great deal of frustration if done regularly. \n\nThere are some cases where you're compelled by law to believe the words over the actions. For example - if her body language indicates a strong desire for sex but she says no, he'd be locked up for rape if he goes ahead with the sex. However, because of the mixed messages she's sending him, the relationship between the two will suffer a serious blow. \n\nThis natural confusion is multiplied by the fact that men are more likely to have false positives and women are more likely to have false negatives. In simple terms - a man is likely to think she's interested when she isn't (false positive) and a woman is likely to think he isn't interested when he really is (false negative). \n\n**Broadcasting to the world through clothing and demeanor** \n\nThe type of clothing we wear, sends messages about ourselves to the world. Our facial expressions and body language does the same. These messages are broadcast whether we like them or not. Body language experts can often expose the true intentions that lays behind the lies and bluff. \n\nSome clothing say - take me seriously. Some clothing say - take me sexually. Some clothing say - look here. Some clothing say - nothing to see here. Some clothing say - open for business. Some clothing say - I'm closed off. Oftentimes, there are several messages being broadcast simultaneously. \n\nWhen a woman wears a push-up bra with a low cut shirt that accentuates her cleavage, that sends a loud message to the male gaze. It says look here buddy. Likewise with form fitting yoga pants that accentuate the butt. Likewise with many other articles of clothing and accessories that say - **look here**.\n\nWhen a woman wears a short skirt or a button down shirt that's open down the middle, it sends a message that says - I want you to imagine what's beyond the curtain. \n\nWhen a man wears a suit and tie with nice shoes, it sends a message that says - I'm a respectable person who's ready for business. Take me seriously. \n\nWhen a man wears baggy pants halfway down his ass with a hoodie over his head and wabbels like a duck, it sends a message that says - I'm a lowlife and possibly a thug who has nothing real going on in his life. \n\nIt isn't politically correct to say these things but TRP is about seeking the truth even when uncomfortable. The truth is that your clothing and your body language broadcast messages to the world. Furthermore, you get to choose what to wear but you don't get to choose who will see you once you step outside. Therefore, if you aren't comfortable broadcasting [insert specific message here] to **the whole entire world**, perhaps it's time to broadcast a different message. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe can go on all day regarding specific clothing and demeanor and the messages they broadcast. The point is clear - clothing and demeanor broadcast things about you whether you like it or not, whether you're conscious of it or not. \n\nIf your words don't match the message being broadcast, it'll lead to confusion and frustration. If your words contradict the unspoken messages, it'll compound this confusion and frustration. \n\nSend the message you want the whole world to see!\n\nCheers!\n","title":"The unspoken language of clothing and demeanor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9nmmi0\/the_unspoken_language_of_clothing_and_demeanor\/"}

Some ladies may be innocent and unaware, but I think a lot of these kinds of posts are by women who are nervous and afraid. \n\nThey found TRP or rpw and through those lenses see that, along with their own damaging behavior, their man isn't a great or natural leader. He's tripping some red flags, but she wants to give him the benefit of her doubt. \n\nShe's basically here asking how to ignore it or fluff pillows around his bullshit to make it more comfortable. DONT FLUFF PILLOWS FOR BULLSHIT TO GET COMFORTABLE. **You are his partner, point it out.** Respectfully and tactfully acknowledging that he could better his position, leadership, whatever, is ok. \n\n[I'm not talking about nagging him.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2y95v1\/a_powerful_image_that_speaks_for_itself\/)\n\nI'm talking about things like, \"He really hates my friends and my family and when I spend time with them. He must think they're not good for me, and I need to trust him.\" Or \"He spends his paycheck in two days and is in debt to all his friends and he just needs a few dollars from me to pay rent and get groceries and beer and go to the casino. He needs his hobbies and his alone time, so I'm going to work on not being so guarded with my money. I need to trust him.\" Or \"He wrapped a towing chain around my waist and shackled me to the radiator for my own safety.

But if he's failing in major areas, you don't just say fuck it and fly into the side of a mountain! \n\nJust because he is *your* man does not mean his a *trustworthy* man. Not all men are worth submitting to and following but ones that are sure won't complain about his lady wanting to keep him sharp. If you're six months in or a year in or however long into a relationship and he's a bumbling moron or a controlling, short-tempered micromanager then LEAVE! \n\nBeing a rpw **does not** mean ignoring all of your built in alarm systems and blindly trusting a man no matter how badly you want to! \n\nBeing a responsible adult who is in charge of yourself means taking an honest look at how capable and trustworthy the man is who you're allowing to lead you! \n\nYes, every man has flaws. You are wholly welcome to support your man. I support mine. But if his stomach starts getting soft I might give him a playful poke and ask him if we can have dead lifts for dessert. \n\nBeing a rpw is not about taking on all of his burdens and making his life a pleasure cruise and pretending he's perfect. It's about supporting a man in a way that enables him to be the best man he can be. He can't be the best man he can be if you let him fail and just cringe and hope it gets better. Maybe serve him a drink while the house burns down because *you need to trust him!* \n\nA mans burdens are rightfully his to carry, so you help him to grow into the kind of man who *can* carry them. \n\nThere's shutting up and letting him do his thing, and there's ignoring problems and red flags. \n\nExamples of ladies doing it right: \n\n--[Doorknobs.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2w7doh\/the_doorknob_incident_that_wasnt\/)\n\n--[Sewage.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/25aoo1\/displaying_trust_lfmf\/?)\n\n--[Owning her misbehavior.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1wcudk\/rpw_is_both_improving_and_hurting_my_relationship\/?) \n\nAnd [this is interesting.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1xk830\/sometimes_the_first_officer_actually_overrules\/?) The comments are important. \n\nSo basically, you're not **only** there to look pretty and blindly trust. Trust is earned, not given! You're there to look pretty and **be a smart FO.**\n\nNot every relationship is perfect. Not every example of trust is something like a home repair. Sometimes you do have to cut the lifeboats and ride the storm out. I have, and it don't regret it. But I knew all of what I was getting into, and I needed to consult with **no one** because I was not looking for reasons to ignore a blaring warning and make myself a martyr. \n\nUse your heads.

She was saying that she can\u2019t find a man that is both progressive and masculine\/traditional, and questioning whether they exist. The comments completely tore her up saying that obviously progressive men are not going to be traditional. And that a progressive and traditional man obviously does not exist. \n\nBased on my experience living in a very blue state, this is completely untrue. Politics, especially regarding social issues, does not determine how a man or woman acts in their personal romantic relationships. Politics can be kept completely separate from the dynamics one chooses to practice in their romantic relationships. \n\nYou can support gay rights and women\u2019s rights\/equality, while also choosing to be submissive in your relationship. Just because a man is progressive does not mean that he is not masculine. My current boyfriend would identify as a democrat (according to the US\u2019s limited options). And he is one of the most genuinely and naturally masculine men I\u2019ve ever been with or even met. He provides for me and takes care of me, but still supports women\u2019s rights and my independence. \n\nI think there is such a stereotype among democrats especially that traditional men limit their female partner\u2019s rights and autonomy. And that they are republican. I believe that sure a lot of conservative men are more traditional than \u201cliberal\u201d men, but this does not mean that liberal men are not traditional. Just because a man chooses the more traditional masculine role, and his counterpart chooses the more traditional feminine role, does not make these people automatically \u201cright wing.\u201d\n\nThe girl in the video also talked about how she wants a traditional man but doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cconfined to the homemaker role\u201d and have to change her beliefs and have independence taken away. THIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOURE WITH A TRADITIONAL\/MASCULINE MAN!!! You are not \u201cconfined\u201d to the homemaker role. Sure that may be part of your role, and maybe the majority of your role in the relationship if that\u2019s what you and your partner decide. But you are not \u201cconfined\u201d to that role. That\u2019s just called being a good partner and sharing responsibilities. \n\nAnd you sure as heck don\u2019t need to change your beliefs and have your independence taken away to be with a masculine man. I think a lot of masculine men would respect that. You don\u2019t want to start arguments and be a difficult person to be around, and you want to find someone with similar values, of course. But this idea that being with a traditional man means giving up your independence of thought and freedom is just totally false. \n\nI live in an extremely liberal big city, and I identify as \u201cdemocrat\u201d, AND I\u2019m in a traditional relationship. I submit to my partner and follow RPW. I don\u2019t openly discuss this with my friends for fear of backlash, but I do make little comments here and there to test the waters. I see so many of my liberal girl friends and family struggling with their relationships and dating and I really wish I could introduce them to RPW but I know that would just blow up in my face so I never will. I wish people could understand that being in or desiring a traditional relationship is not equal to your rights being taken away or being a republican.\n\nI love RPW and this community. It\u2019s truly made me a better person and helped me get the relationship of my dreams.

When I first met him I really admired what he did. When we got married I was so happy.\n\nBut then it took years for him to get a tenure track job, and he refused to have children until afterwards. During this time we moved every 10 months for his temporary jobs. I admire his tenacity but it started to feel very selfish that he would not consider other kinds of work when staying on his original course was preventing us from starting life. I was not able to have our first baby until I was 36 (we got married when I was 29).\n\nThe special prize on the end of this journey is a tenured job at a prestigious university, but he regularly complains about it. He talks about wanting to switch departments and move AGAIN. \n\nThrough this process with him I have come to lose respect for academia. What he does (prove math theorems) is not used in the real world for anything meaningful or useful. It is not very high paying, yet he gets consumed by his research (he does like that part, just not the politics of the department). He is very good at it and very competitive about it.\n\nAnd of course he wants appreciation and respect from me for all of his hard work. \n\nBut here is the crux of it. I have a hard time feeling like I or our daughter has anything at all to do with why he works. He works to feed his own ego, and he doesn\u2019t try to advance in ways that will impact us positively but rather in ways that will elevate him in this esoteric, out of touch community that I no longer respect and have nothing to do with. In fact, he did this for years while I suffered waiting to have a baby. \n\nI would like to replace my resentment with appreciation but I am struggling.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the replies. Through this exchange I am realizing that my issue is that I have not gotten over how I felt when he was indifferent to my pain while we were moving every 10 months for 6 years. All I wanted was to start a family, and each year that went by I got older snd older and felt so scared that we\u2019d have trouble when we eventually started trying. He refused to start until he got a tenure track job, no matter how many years it took. I saw up close that he would sacrifice my fertility and my dreams of a family in order to stay on one particular career path, and I think even though we are settled now I am just not over it.","title":"Help me change my mindset towards my husband","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/o30wo8\/help_me_change_my_mindset_towards_my_husband\/"}

Then I saw the messages on his IG. Today he messaged in the group chat he might leave the group in case I come over. So he's definitely trying to keep me in the dark. \n\nI have not confronted him. I tried to get him to tell me about it by asking about his friend and then what she was doing for his birthday... He straight up lied to me. How often has he lied to me? Do all men lie? This is a big one.\n\nI am trying not to turn the breakup into a big fight, I just want to bow out. I have stuff at his place and I want to make sure I'm not leaving behind valuables. I also have a cell phone plan with him... \n\nI just need advice on HOW to break up with him. I have never broken up with someone I still had feelings for.

I was thinking of maybe just driving out there (he's 90 miles from me now) when he's at work and going through boxes to find my stuff and explaining the situation to his mom.

I've never had a serious boyfriend or went on a real date, but I've had a few hookups. In my mind I could make up for my insecurities about being \"undateable\" by cheating my way to the end- the end being sex. \n\nI recently (last april) went nun mode and completely celibate not because I was ready to practice being modest and trad- there was just something that made me want to stop fucking guys I wasn't emotionally attached to. But my problem is- I think I'm just not built to be a chaste woman until I meet my mr right. I'm not saying I want to hoe it up, but I can't even conceptualize what dating would be like without sex.\n\nThe reason why I stopped having sex is I stopped being stupid and realized I'm not \"winning\" anything by having mediocre car sex. I couldn't get any enjoyment out of interacting with men in any romantic\/sexual way. I have actual PTSD from an unrelated event, and how I feel about sex is pretty similar to how I feel about those events. Every time I remember hanging out with a guy who I thought liked me, I can remember exactly when this feeling of dread would kick in. Like as he touched me, I realized \"he wouldn't be moving this fast if he thought you were girlfriend material. you lost.\". \n\nThis feeling of dread just follows me everywhere. It's all the more conflicting because I'm not prudish by any means. I'm not looking for a relationship now but if I were to find a guy that likes me and I like him I feel like I'd be at a standstill. If he's not sexually attracted to me and making moves on me (provided I'm attracted to him) I feel undesirable. If he IS sexually attracted to me, I couldn't feel like he REALLY liked me. \n\nI honestly wish I could still live in the delusion that having sex is empowering. I feel the exact fucking opposite, whenever I even think about myself as a sexual being I just feel powerless and disposable.","title":"(NSFW) How do I get over feeling guilty about sex?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/d8fkt8\/nsfw_how_do_i_get_over_feeling_guilty_about_sex\/"}

This can be either a challenge for us to maintain respect & attraction **OR** an opportunity for us to practice love, generosity, & support.\n\nA recent example from my life:\n\nMy husband has been having a difficult week at work, & he had a particularly terrible day yesterday. Usually, he goes to the gym every day after work, but the past 2 days, he has skipped his workouts & instead wanted to take walks in the park with me. We enjoy walking together, usually on the weekends, & we often walk holding hands while he gently leads us on whichever path or to a cafe or whatever.\n\nYesterday, however, he literally could NOT lead. He almost walked us into oncoming traffic \\(exaggerating here, but usually he is SO cautious & deliberate\\), he kept kind of driving me off the side of the path, etc. He kept asking me questions: where should we go, how long should we walk, should we go this way or that. **At one point, another man saw us walking, & he actually commented to correct the way my husband was leading me.**\n\nAnyway, regardless of my slight feelings of impatience, annoyance, & \u201cunsafe\\-ness,\u201d I continued to let my husband lead. I let him lead when he chose my least favorite path on the side of a busy street, when he walked on the road instead of the sidewalk, & when he led us a mile out of the way to a store neither of us like to buy a thing we didn\u2019t need. When my husband asked me if he was doing ok after the man criticized him, I assured him his way was acceptable & he is a good man.\n\nMy husband wasn\u2019t acting like the man I most often see, but I was able to choose to treat him with the same amount of respect & deference. I know the reason he was seemingly weak \\(skipping workouts, asking me for directions\\) & distracted \\(wandering paths & odd navigational choices\\) was actually that he is focused on being the best provider he can be, & he has about 1000 different pieces of 5 different puzzles moving around in his mind right now. He was captaining an invisible ship, & I was able to believe in & respond to the ghost of his vanished frame.\n\nAs a result, I feel closer to him, & I feel more empathetic & grateful toward how hard he works. I know he appreciated me as well, because he stopped in the middle of the path while we were walking, took my hands, kissed me, & asked if I would stay married to him.\n\nTLDR: When you are committed to a good man, you can choose to give him his frame even when he drops it. This allows a man to have safe space \/ \u201ca soft place to land\u201d without him feeling constant pressure to \u201cbe a man\u201d & without you losing respect or attraction.","title":"Holding frame (when he drops it)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8kethp\/holding_frame_when_he_drops_it\/"}

Some of the content of this post builds upon those posts. I'd also strongly recommend reading the recent posts by u\/girlwithabike on the book \"for women only\". \n\n**What is love?** \n\nLove is a big word that means a lot of different things. The definition of love changes based on the context, but there's an overarching common theme to the concept of love - an emotion that brings two people closer together. The difference between different types of love is how they bring people together and in what way they come closer together. \n\nThe context and types of love are so different from one another that one type of love can be **inappropriate** in the context of a different type of love. For example, the parent\/child relationship is one context for love, the husband\/wife relationship is different context for love. If you love your child with the type of love that ought to be reserved for your spouse, you'd go to jail! If you love your spouse with the type of love that is like a parent\/child type of love, you'll have many issues in your marriage! Understanding the context and type of love we're after is key for success. The rest of the post will focus on the varying types of love between men and women. \n\n**Men date down, women date up**\n\nThis is true in many ways and has been [discussed in a previous post.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8fujkz\/back_to_the_basics_hypergamy\/) To expound on what has already been covered - the male and female love themselves also move in opposite directions. If love is the emotion that brings two people together + men date down and women date up = logic follows that male love operates in a 'downward motion' while female love operates in an 'upward motion' as will soon be explained. \n\n**Male expressions of love** \n\nA woman arouses within a man a deep seated desire to provide for her and protect her. Both of these can be seen as having a downward motion and fit perfectly with the idea that men date and marry down. \n\nTo be a provider entails a great deal of generosity. Indeed, a man will express his love through giving his time, energy and money to support the woman he loves and to do things that will make her life easier. Same is true with regards to being the protector. The man - as the one who's bigger, stronger and braver - is protecting his wife and children who are smaller, weaker and more timid. \n\nThis type of love is constant and steady. It's always there, never wanes. It's in a downward motion because it's to provide and protect for the weaker members of the family. This love comes with ease. It moves downward, with the force of gravity. This type of love is analogous to water that's always there, flows downward effortlessly, makes things stick together and is cold. \n\n**Female expressions of love** \n\nA man awakens within a woman a sense of [awe and respect](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8cnh7l\/for_women_only_respect_and_love_chapter_2\/) through being better than her and higher up in the hierarchy. Through providing the male type of unwavering, steady provision and protection. She looks **up** to him and that's sexy to her. Her deep respect, awe and admiration for him is what arouses her love. \n\nThis love goes against gravity and is not always there. Unlike the man who's steady like a rock and full of generosity - the woman is prone to mood swings that come with the ups and downs of the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, the woman's love and desire for her man is also not at all steady. It changes drastically all the time. \n\nThe woman must be there to **nurture** the child. Nurturing is fundamentally different from generosity. Generosity is to give new stuff endlessly, nurturing is to keep out all foreign stuff and to grow what you already have. Traditionally, men brought home the bacon and women turned it into a delicious and nourishing meal. The man was generous, the woman was nurturing. \n\nBut although the female love isn't steady (hence the saying - she'll never love you the way you love her), when it's there, it's much much stronger than the male version of love. Anyone who had sex knows that when a woman is truly turned on, she'll easily outpace a man. OTOH, the man can **always** be turned on, rain or shine, stressed or calm, exhausted or we'll rested. The man can turn on in relatively short order because his love is steady and always there. Not so with a woman who needs more time to **warm up** and when she warms up, boy does she get hot! \n\nWhich is why female love is analogous to fire that rises up, that needs constant fueling lest it burn out, that is all consuming and that can be extremely constructive or destructive depending on how it's used. \n\n**What we need from each other** \n\nMen crave respect because this indicates that she's looking up to him. Next, men crave sexual desire from their women because that's the result of her looking up to him. The male love that's always present and contained, like cold water in a bowl, craves to be brought to a boil through her fiery sexual passion that comes as a result of her deep admiration for him. \n\nWomen crave stability to counterbalance the turbulence of their emotional roller coaster. The rock in the stormy waters. What do women find sexy in a man? Strong arms, a strong personality and other displays of strength. When a woman cries and falls apart and her man helps hold her together, he will become sexually aroused (even if he'll try to hide it because it's inappropriate). When a man cries and falls apart, the woman becomes sexually turned off. She needs strength and steadiness from him. She needs him to remain cool through the turbulent thrashing heat of her emotions. She needs him to always be there and always be ready for her when her fire ignites. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nMen and women love in different ways. Male love is cold, constant and steady. Female love is hot, turbulent and unsteady. This can be frustrating to men because when the woman's love is not openly present while his love is as steady as always, he's bound to feel that his love is not being reciprocated. That's why many men conclude that women are incapable of love, period. Truth is, that we each love in different ways. The female fire of love can be consciously kept alive in the heart and actions of a woman who **consciously chooses** to do so. Many women don't bother making this choice and that's cause for much male frustration. However, this is nothing new. King Solomon wrote in the book of proverbs - a woman of Valor, who can find her? He goes on to describe her as being a rare find. If you consciously choose, you can be this woman!\n\nCheers!","title":"Back to the basics - are women capable of love?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8j75dv\/back_to_the_basics_are_women_capable_of_love\/"}

A lot of the advice we receive is geared towards not telling our man what to do, and stop taking charge. Stop nagging, and stop trying to control or change your man. This is good advice.\n\nThen we receive advice about trying to be the goddess and light, or trying to be the most cheerful versions of ourselves we can be. Be a soft place for him to land, always greet him with a smile, make his experience with you pleasant. This is also good advice.\n\nHowever, the advice above cannot work all the time, because we have needs as well. Sometimes there is something we need or want, and we want to be able to communicate that to our partner. This is not only \u201cokay\u201d to do, this is one of your most important responsibilities to your partner. If you have a good captain, he wants you to be happy. If you take STFU too far, and never communicate, he can't do his job as a captain. He can't steer the ship if he doesn't know what's going on with you.\n\nIf you never tell your captain there is something wrong, he will never know, and never be able to fix it. Then you will start resenting him for not taking your needs into consideration. Remember you are on the same team. Your happiness is important to him, just like his is to you. \n\nDon't keep it bottled up, tell your captain if you have problem.\n\n**Part 2: Don't Bring Your Captain Your Solution**\n\nThis part is how you keep from sounding nagging, or like you are trying to tell your captain what to do. When you tell your captain something is bothering you, it is not your responsibility to tell him how to solve the problem, it is only your responsibility to tell him that you have one. \n\nAn example of this could be almost anything, but imagine that you are upset because your man spends every Friday night at guys' night, and you are beginning to feel unwelcome among his friends, and really you feel like you guys don't really get to spend much time together. A post in RPW would tell you that it's not your place to invade your man's space, and to get over it by getting a hobby. While logically this makes sense, we don't always have perfect control over our emotions. This is where the ability to tell our captain our problem comes into play. But, how you do it is important.\n\nComing to your captain with your solution it could look like many things;\n\n\u201cI want you to spend more time with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to not go out with your friends so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be invited when you go out with your friends.\u201d\n\nWhen you come to your captain with your solution, you are telling him what actions to take to solve the problem that you have. There are some issues with this approach, your man may begin to resent you for telling him what to do. This is where you start to become the boss of your relationship. Also, if he does comply, you don't know if he did it because you told him to, or because he really wanted to, which leads to more insecurity issues.\n\nInstead, you tell your captain your problem by leading with your emotions. \u201cI miss you because you are out all the time.\u201d \u201cI am envious of all the time your friends get to spend with you.\u201d By expressing your problems this way, you are giving your captain the opportunity to come up with a solution on his own initiative. Maybe he will plan a special outing for just the two of you. Maybe he will surprise you by inviting to join them. Maybe he will take a moment to text you \u201cI love you\u201d while he is out with his friends. You will get a response from him that he wanted to give you, and because the response comes from him, it will make you feel loved and appreciated. \n\nThis works because your man wants to to protect you and men are natural problem solvers. By showing them your vulnerability and your emotions, your captain will jump into protection mode, and when he does, all you have to do is smile and give him a big hug.","title":"Bring Your Captain Your Problem, Not Your Solution","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4i8ukh\/bring_your_captain_your_problem_not_your_solution\/"}

And while he wasn't saying it directly at me, I have to admit that it stung quite a bit because I took it personally. But once I got over my feelings of entitlement, it actually got me thinking about what it means to be replaceable. \n\nWe are all replaceable to someone. Even as basic members of society, we are replaceable. Most of us will live for 80+ years and then die. The future generation will replace the current one. So on and so forth. \n\nWhile it's easy to think of being replaceable in terms of the big picture (i.e., society), it's a lot harder to think of it when you're dealing with intimate relationships. There are these funny things called emotions that bond us to certain people and sometimes we forget our role within the relationship. What starts out as a two-way, mutually beneficial setup can easily become a one-way street to misery that we either resign ourselves to or \"upgrade\" (but really, rinse and repeat). Unfortunately, this has become commonplace with some women even when we don't think we're doing it. We slack off here and there, we gain a little weight (or a lot), we prioritize differently now than a few years ago, etc. And we expect our partners to put up with this. For some relationships, our partners DO put up with this. I've witnessed it in my own social circle and in various other social circles. Why do we do this though? When we start out in relationships, we want to present our best possible self in order to attract\/keep the man. So why don't we want to continue to do that 10 or 20 years down the line? \n\nWhen I first thought of myself as being replaceable, I thought of it in a very negative way. I like feeling special to my partner and feeling replaceable takes away those feelings. It makes you think, \"What's the point?\". However, I have learned to replace those thoughts with these: My partner is not obligated to be with me. He CHOOSES to be with me of his own free will. Gratitude for that is not out of desperation, but out of humility. I do not think I'm entitled to my partner's love or care or material goods, but I graciously accept and appreciate that he chooses to share those things with me. And because I keep that frame of mind, I am filled with the genuine desire to want to be my best possible self for him. He could still replace me if he wanted, so this doesn't come from a place of fear or manipulation which I think is a common misconception. I could be everything he wanted and he could still say \"No\", just as I could be a nagging harpy and he could still say \"No\". So trying to argue that this mindset comes from fear\/manipulation is really just a moot point.\n\nWe are all replaceable. We should never forget that, in general, others are not obligated to us.

She has worked part-time her entire career, as have almost all of her friends\u2014married or unmarried, kids or no kids\u2014save one or two who logged more hours out of financial necessity. Van Haeren, who wasn\u2019t married until last year and has no children, says she\u2019s worked part-time \u201cto have time to do things that matter to me, live the way I want. To stay mentally and physically healthy and happy.\u201d\n\nMany women in the Netherlands seem to share similar views, valuing independence over success in the workplace. In 2001, nearly 60 per cent of working Dutch women were employed part-time, compared to just 20 per cent of Canadian women. Today, the number is even higher, hovering around 75 per cent. Some, like Van Haeren, view this as progress, evidence of personal freedom and a commitment to a balanced lifestyle.\n\nOthers, however, view it as an alarming signal that women are no longer seeking equality in the workplace. Writer and economist Heleen Mees, for example, argues that the stereotypical Dutch woman has become complacent. \u201cEven at the University of Amsterdam\u2014the most progressive university we have\u2014I had a 22-year-old student say, \u2018Why is it your business if my wife wants to bake cookies?\u2019 and the female students agreed with him! I was like, what\u2019s happening here?\u201d\n\nMees runs an organization called Women on Top that strives to push more Dutch women into ambitious career paths. Its slogan is \u201cOut with the part-time feminism!\u201d and it points to part-time work as a major factor in a lingering pay gap. Then there\u2019s the matter of principle. \u201cI think highly educated women have a moral obligation to take top positions, to set an example by their choices,\u201d says Mees. \u201cWhen women just stay at home or work part-time, they don\u2019t reach the top, and they set bad examples for their daughters and daughters\u2019 daughters.\u201d\n\nBut Dutch women appear deaf to the siren call of the workplace. Asked whether they\u2019d like to increase their hours, just four per cent said yes, compared to 25 per cent of French women. And while across the Channel, British media are heralding the resurgence of feminism\u2014last weekend, some 500 women crowded into a feminist training camp, UK Feminista, to be trained in direct action and activism\u2014in Holland, women like Van Haeren baldly proclaim no further need for the movement. \u201cFeminism wasn\u2019t necessary anymore by the time I grew up,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my eyes, it was a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between personal lifestyle choices and the socio-economic standing of women has been under the microscope in Holland ever since the publication of Dutch Women Don\u2019t Get Depressed in 2008. Ellen de Bruin, who patterned her book after Mireille Guiliano\u2019s bestseller French Women Don\u2019t Get Fat, began by defining the stereotypical Dutch woman: naturally beautiful with a no-fuss sense of style, she rides her bike to fetch the groceries, has ample time with her kids and husband, takes art classes in the middle of the week, and spends leisurely afternoons drinking coffee with her friends. She loves to work part-time and does not earn as much as her husband, but she\u2019s fine with that\u2014he takes care of the bills. The book went on to note that Dutch women rank consistently low, compared to those in other Western countries, in terms of representation in top positions in business and government\u2014and rank consistently near the top in terms of happiness and well-being. In fact, just about everyone in Holland seems pleased with the status quo; in 2009, the Netherlands ranked highest of all OECD countries in terms of overall well-being.\n\nUnderstandably, the notion that there\u2019s a correlation between women\u2019s relative powerlessness and their happiness rubs people like Heleen Mees the wrong way. Yet others frame the correlation differently, arguing that Dutch women have smashed the vicious circle of guilt that traps other Western women, to embrace a progressive form of work-life balance.\n\nSarah Sands, of the U.K.\u2019s Independent, writes, \u201cPerhaps [Dutch women] are happy because they don\u2019t feel guilty for falling short of perfection. We are torn to shreds between the American and the Mediterranean models of womanhood. On one hand, we are boardroom feminists expecting equality of expectation and outcome. On the other, we are matriarchs, wanting to run model kitchens and walk through meadows with bands of children.\u201d\n\nOr to put it another way: yes, the personal is political\u2014but it\u2019s also pretty personal, too, and happiness has to count for something. As Germaine Greer opined in a recent interview on CBC Radio\u2019s Q, \u201cI think you have to understand that the corporate world is not the only world, and if women are going to enjoy their working lives, they have to arrive at a different paradigm. Life in the corporation is not all that much fun.\u201d\n\nVan Haeren echoes these sentiments. \u201cDutch women do not aspire to top positions because they do not want to encourage the values of the business models of today\u2019s world. It is a silent resistance movement,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe this will turn out to be the fourth wave of feminism. Women protect the possibility that one day we\u2019ll wake up to realize that life is not all about acquiring more material wealth, power, status. Many Dutch women that I know want to stay sane, happy, relaxed.\u201d\n\nEline Duterloo, 48, agrees. \u201cI think women just simply do not look for 100 per cent fulfillment in their work. Women see themselves in a lot of different roles that they find more important to them: being a good friend, a good daughter, a good mother, a good sister, a good wife. That is why they are not 100 per cent competitive, and so do not reach the top, because in their hearts they do not really care about it enough.\u201d Duterloo has a husband (who works full-time) and three daughters, aged 21, 19, and 16; she recently started working full-time as legal counsel to a major American corporation after years of part-time work.\n\nAuthor Ellen de Bruin is puzzled that \u201ceverybody seems to have an opinion about how Dutch women are leading their lives, and some say it\u2019s enlightened and others say it\u2019s old-fashioned. What I find funny is the point of view that somehow we have found the solution for this work-life imbalance. What\u2019s important is that women in the Netherlands are free to choose whatever they want to do.\u201d\n\nSocial structures, however, undoubtedly play a role in what choices are available. Generous social programs make it possible for a two-parent family to get by quite nicely on a single full-time income. And yet, a strain of social conservatism persists in Holland: daycare is expensive, and shops close at 6 p.m. on weekdays and are closed entirely on Sundays\u2014less than conducive to the daily juggling of full-time work and raising a family.\n\nWomen aren\u2019t alone in choosing to opt out of the full-time rat race. More men are working part-time than ever before, and society is beginning to reward fathers for pushing back against the system to make time for their families. Last year, Lof, a magazine for working mothers, awarded a \u201cWorking Dad Prize\u201d to a man who fought his employer in court and won the right to work part-time. And this year, businessman Rutger Groot Wassink was acknowledged by the government with a \u201cModern Man Prize\u201d for his work in co-founding a campaign that promotes \u201cPapadag\u201d (Daddy day)\u2014a day off for working fathers to be with their kids.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue that people who choose the lives they want, and opt for happiness rather than titles, are not empowered. (I grew up in the Netherlands with a Dutch mother and a Canadian father and came of age watching my female relatives\u2014who hail from educated, middle-class families\u2014repeatedly prioritize free time over career progress and money.) Nevertheless, Mees argues that striving for happiness is slowing down progress in the women\u2019s movement. \u201cHappiness is overrated. It\u2019s defined as the absence of problems. But it\u2019s good to have challenges in your life. I believe in another kind of strength that women should have.\u201d\n\nDe Bruin disagrees. \u201cI think that\u2019s such a strange argument. I hear it all the time. At some point, happiness is everybody\u2019s ultimate goal. Everybody is seeking a way to live their own life in the most satisfying manner.\u201d\n\nIn 1986, Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique, came under fire when she told the New York Times, \u201cWhat we need are real choices. And I don\u2019t want to hear women saying one choice is more feminist than another.\u201d\n\nPerhaps women in the Netherlands have achieved that vision of real choices. Certainly, the prevailing cultural attitude seems to be that one choice\u2014say, working part-time instead of striving for the corner office\u2014isn\u2019t better than another. Whatever this says about the current state of feminism, it is evidence of a certain type of independence: in Holland, it\u2019s every woman for herself.","title":"How Dutch women got to be the happiest in the world -- Checkmate feminists","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/23mg3y\/how_dutch_women_got_to_be_the_happiest_in_the\/"}

Married for over three years, together for over 7. We met in college and really grew together, focusing on building our financial house and attaining the things we wanted in life. Maybe this was a mistake. We're doing well in our respective fields. We are under contract to sell our first home next month and our new build should be complete by the end of the year.\n\nWe can afford to save and travel. He can drive the type of car he wants to drive, which was very important to him. He can indulge in his hobbies. We live very comfortable lives for people our age.\n\nPerhaps focusing too much on my career was a mistake. Perhaps I didn't find a family-oriented man. I don't know.  But I've been asking since I turned 25 to have kids and he still has not been ready. There have been a lot of excuses, but mainly fear of loss of freedom\/flexibility with money to do what he wants to do. We've always agreed on having kids, it was the when, not if. I have gotten really bold about it over the past year, joking when he'll give me a baby, openly discussing timelines, etc. He was okay with those discussions when lighthearted, but when it came down to set a date, he would refuse. The wait has been extremely conflicting for me. So I eventually let him know, about a month ago, that my personal line in the sand is end of 2023, and if we can't start trying by then, then unfortunately we'll have to go our separate ways. He told me he understood and we haven't spoken about it after that.\n\nI'm trying to remain optimistic that this won't end in a divorce. I show up for him hard, every day, to try to foster an environment that feels conducive to having children in. But I'm also second-guessing myself. Having children is really important to me, and I see him as the father of my future children. From what I can understand, he's not ready to allocate funds from \"fun stuff\" to kids, and \"put fun behind him.\" It's hard to not see him as immature because of this, despite how on-his-shit he really is in life in general.\n\nWhile I'm a realistic person, I'm not the type who believes you can never video game or travel or meet up with the boys once kids happen, and that our marriage will become the stereotype about kids being the nail in the coffin. I work very hard to ensure he doesn't feel nagged at home, and that he has all the freedom in the world to do whatever he wants. When he announces he's going out to the bar with friends, I cheerily smile and say \"That'll be nice, I hope you have fun!\" and that's that.\n\nMy line in the sand has ultimately provided me the peace I was looking for, because he could not provide me the assurance that we would start trying by x date. I'm envious that he's not the enthusiastic future dad some of my other married friends have. But over the past few months (when I really have stepped up my RPW game), whenever we do talk about our future kids, in a casual setting teasing about how he'd handle x thing or when we'd bring them to y place, it's nice, and feels normal. So I'm disappointed that he is playing the scared man role in parallel with envisioning some future with our kids, even if it's a common thing many men go through. I have a lot of mixed emotions about it and wonder if I just need to stop overthinking it and take the fact that he hasn't walked away yet as a sign that doesn't want to lose me over this, even if he can't say it aloud.\n\nHonestly, my only plan is to keep moving as normal, but also start mentally preparing to detach and walk away around next fall, so that when the end of 2023 comes, I'm ready. If he ends up being ready before end of 2023, it'd be a welcomed miracle. But that \"preparing to leave\" mindset doesn't seem compatible with the RPW way.\n\nMaybe it's the \"start of a new cycle\" disappointment, but I'm just really down and conflicted about it today, and trying not to get into \"He's never going to be ready by your deadline, stop kidding yourself!\" territory.\n\n**Edit:** I thought my post would head off \"Does he even want kids?\" questions but I suppose it's best to clarify - he does want children. He's never wavered on that. The issue has always been *when,* not *if,* and that is the subject of this post.

Also, I have given \"The Surrendered Wife\" a read, as I have seen it recommended here at every corner! \n\n1. My  work has significantly improved in  quality \n\nOnly working 4 hours instead of 8 has not only improved my focus, but at the end of the day I have no issue with taking an extra 30 minutes to tweak things up just for my own peace of mind. I asked for a raise and when my boss saw my work he gave it to me. Yay! \n\n2, My home is so much more organized and clean \n\nI never run out of clean laundry, never run out of tooth paste or garbage bags because I have the time to look out for everything. Whenever my boyfriend asks, I know where the tools are, where the scissors are, all the cleaning products and so on. I always have matching socks, always have pantyhose, always know where my clothes are. One stress has been eliminated from my life!\n\n3. I still fail at cooking \n\nI can still only make basic foods and I fail whenever I try to make something fancy. Our local recipes are garbage that I cannot follow and the ones in English have ingredients that I don't know the equivalent of.  Thankfully my man is  an amazing home cook and has stopped trying to get me to cook the same as him. When he sees that all his shoes are clean and his t-shirts ironed then he doesn't care that I only made fries and squirted some ketchup on them! His cooking is his pride and glory anyway.  \n\n4. Men ARE more generous with us than we are with ourselves \n\nI have tried to restrain myself from buying frivolous things since our budget is lower. Two shades of lipstick caught my eye and I felt quite guilty of buying them (since I don't wear lipstick daily), but he insisted that my beauty is important  and I should get them. I also had money saved for an AC unit but he paid it in full. It turns out  that Laura Doyle was right and men absolutely love to provide and pamper their loved ones and do not transform into stingy dictators. \n\n5. This type of arrangement DOES delay marriage \n\nUnfortunately I could have never afforded to live alone (and to be honest it, I would have been afraid to in this area) and I never gave much thought to this years ago. I point blank asked my boyfriend if he would have already  married me if it was required to be living together and he said \"yes\". I had tried a strategy another user has written here, to only  talk  about marriage ONCE and for good, explicitly stating \"I will only say it once\".  It did not work. Sadly, I had gotten emotionaly  about it, but perhaps getting emotional as a woman is not a bad thing. Perhaps men brush off our issues until we cry about it, just like we brush off men's issues until they are angry about it. Who knows. As if the universe wanted to plot against me, he eventually managed to order a beautifuuuull ring from Etsy, yet the tracking for it shows it exiting the Ukraininan border and never entering Romanian customs since ... february. Eh. \n\n6. Our sex life is booming \n\nI had a dead bedroom issue at some point that got me to question whether I want to be with him for the rest of my life or not. I had made a few changes, followed Laura Doyle's advice and now I get hotter sex than I had back when we started to date! Sometimes we do it while we are supposed to work, between meetings, sometimes three times a day, he wants me even when my hair is gresy and I am wearing my pajams! Never ever had I thought I would reach this point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are so happy and fulfilled together in our home life that we concluded this is the love in the books and poems. Everybody around is saying that lockdowns has destroyed their  relationship while we don't care.

I have seen a few times, in here, when people discuss the concept of 'alpha' & 'beta' traits, it comes up whether there is any kind of female equivalent. I guess I should say, less of an equivalent, more of a wavy parallel (if you look at it sideways and drunk). \n\nToday I was browsing on the Bad Girl's Bible. Basically, this man who was pretty happily married, but still ended up attracted to another woman. She was less physically attractive, but he found himself into her, etc. He loved his wife, but they had settled into family life \/ comfort. Obviously there are so many reasons this could happen - even just a man's biological drive to like variety, etc. But it triggered off thoughts about the common Madonna \/ Whore issue a lot of men face. I think I even saw something in here about it recently. \n\nSo then it occurred to me - is this some kind of skewed version of alpha and beta? I mean, of course, for lots of different reasons and mechanisms. But hear me out. Madonna \/ Whore are two separate sets of traits that a woman or women can have. They can co-exist, but sometimes they don't. Some women lean toward \"hot and crazy,\" some women lean toward \"nurturing and boring.\" And there are all kinds of variations and blends in the middle. Men tend to go crazy wanting sex with the \"Whore,\" but she isn't always the type he wants to take home to mom (very similar to our attractions to alpha \/ beta traits). \n\nIdeally, a woman would balance both sides, and find the sweet spot of being good LTR material and still inspiring a man's sex drive. Kind of like how a good Captain is often that \"just-right\" blend of alpha \/ beta traits that works for us; provides us both security and makes us crazy over him. \n\nObviously they don't compare exactly, but they wouldn't, as men & women and the things that attract them to each other are very different. I just wanted to open up the conversation and see if it makes sense to anyone! I just thought it was kind of an interesting thing.\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Alpha \/ Beta ----> Madonna \/ Whore?

Please let me know if you've ever felt the same and how you come to terms with this.\n\nSo, like a lot of us here:\n\nLiterally EVERYONE around me has always been supportive of feminism. I am  in academia and anything that doesn't automatically spew out feminist ideals is INTENSELY frowned upon. I grew up thinking I should focus on my career and that I should be powerful and competitive and never EVER trust any man and never EVER let go.\n\nI've been in a LTR with the same wonderful man for over 11 years now and am 28 so I didn't mess things up in terms of what RPW teaches. I love him so much and feel privileged and lucky to have met him so young and stayed with him. Ever since I found TRP and RPW (3 years ago) I have always 'accepted' RP truths and became obsessed with these sub reddits and the relevant blogs. \n\nHowever, I kind of saw it as a sideline thing. Almost like a... I know it is not purely sexual but almost like a 'kink'... Something that you have a great attraction towards but it doesn't mean you want to completely change your life and relationship in that direction. It just felt like a delicious rebellion against feminism, which always felt oppressive to me. So reading these things were a relief.  \n\n\nBut I obviously I ended up changing things in my life bit by bit: started acting and feeling more feminine, stopped competing with men.... never wanted children and am now seriously considering it.... I have lost weight... I am working out daily.... I STFU... I am trying to make my partner's life better in every way I can...I have been cooking for him and cleaning more.... I am much more comfortable with sex now that I understand the dynamics a bit better.    \n\n\nI feel like I am finally figuring out what it means to be a woman... and damn it.. IT FEELS GOOD! It feels right. It is liberating to not be angry and being told I am an oppressed victim all the time. It feels amazing not to have to compete and be tense 24\/7. Also, my relationship is much better. My SO is so happy and my changes are causing amazing changes in him too and I'm so excited for the future!  \n\n\nBut the fact that RP truths feels so right is disturbing to me, right now. I am just scared that maybe it is all true. Maybe we are in fact different from each other, men and women. Maybe women do really crave leadership. Maybe we do love feeling beautiful. \n\nI'm just worried as I let go into this that there is in fact a patriarchy and that I am being internally misogynistic by acting in RP relevant ways. Has anyone here ever felt the same fears? How did you deal with them?  \n\nYou know, ironically, feminism teaches us that femininity (or feminine characteristics) in its traditional sense is inferior and laughable. And as I accept my femininity more and more. I can't  help but to feel like now I am inferior. Less relevant.   \n\n\nIt's just amazing that it takes a community labeled as misogynistic to make me accept my femininity and womanhood.   \n\n\nI'm just scared that I am missing something  at some point here. Do the feminists see something I'm not seeing? Do they have it right?  \n\n\nI appreciate this might not be the right place to discuss feminism but I am sure people here must have had some inner conflict too. Please let me know how you worked it out!

It is not a success story, sadly, where the woman loses the extra pounds and opens her eyes to a better way of living. It is the story of a deeply unsatisfied alcoholic woman who is unfulfilled by her stressful job and farce of a social life (though she never uses the word \"alcoholic,\" she does admit to drinking a bottle of wine each night). \n\nTo spare those of you with less time on your hands than I had the trouble of pushing through this article, I will simply leave you with a few quotes.\n\n>\"That\u2019s the summer I realize that everyone around me is tanked.

Spend your free time volunteering or doing a wholesome hobby, and for the faithful, find a church community. **Don't become this woman.**\n\nEdit: I'm not saying you can't work and be happy (sadly many women must work in the modern economy).

Among those rules were rules surrounding marriage. Looking back into history from our perspective, these marriages of old seem more like business deals than like the love and romance we like to dream about. Problem is, we haven't fully moved to a world where marriage is defined by love and romance (and we never will). Thus, we now have a really messed up idea of marriage where we are appalled at the idea of obligation while still feeling entitled. \n\n**Marriage of old**\n\nMen and women get married for different reasons. We each have needs and desires which we seek to fulfill by getting married. Some of the actual desires are the same but their rank within the hierarchy of desires is not the same. \n\n(Obviously, your personal millage may vary because both men and women have masculine and feminine character traits, it's just that men are generally more masculine and women are generally more feminine. There are masculine women and feminine men out there. This post will speak in general terms. By \"men\" I mean most men or the more masculine version of humanity and likewise with regards to \"women\".)\n\nIn the days of old, it was not socially acceptable to have sex outside of wedlock. Did it happen? Of course it happened, but it was unacceptable and therefore happened much less and more hidden. Because of this, if you wanted to have a regular sex life, you had to get married. This was true for most people. Since sex is higher up on the list of needs for men, this practically meant that men had to accept marriage in order to have regular sex. There were parts of marriage which he may not have been particularly interested in or perhaps he was indifferent to these parts or even opposed to them, but this was the trade off, he committed to these elements in exchange for regular sex. \n\nSame was true in the reverse. Maybe sex wasn't as important to the woman as it was for her husband. Maybe she would have been okay with half the amount of sex as what he wanted. Maybe she didn't need it altogether. But his happiness, his ongoing commitment and support were extremely important to her and so, in exchange for that, she had more sex than what she would have had if it all went according to her desires. \n\nIt's true that there were miserable men and women back then, there always are. However, to a very large degree, this worked. Men had to prioritize what was important to their wives and women had to prioritize what was important to their husbands. It was a trade-off and everyone knew it and was open about it being a trade-off. But once the terms and conditions were agreed upon, it was **expected** of both parties to keep their end of the deal. Not upholding your end was grounds for divorce while getting the lower hand in the process. \n\n**New age marriage**\n\nAccording to modern thought, nobody owes anything to anyone (except when they do). This is especially true with regards to the obligations of a wife towards her husband. \"It's my body and I don't owe him sex\" is heard quite often. Similar sentiments are sounded with regards to many other issues. (**I'm not here to debate the issues themselves so if you're here to troll, you can leave now**). \n\nOTOH, certain entitlements remain, especially when the marriage doesn't work out and the couple divorces. This is destructive to marriage. As much as we'd like to believe in love and romance, reality is that people want to give and receive within a marriage. When one party feels like they're only giving and not receiving anything in return, they feel taken advantage of and the marriage breaks down from there. \n\nMasculinity and femininity are meant to balance each other to create a harmonized marriage, family, community and world. When we each play to our strengths and work in tandem, our marriages, families, communities and the world at large will be a much more wonderful place to live in. When we work against each other, we experience a breakdown in marriages, families, communities and the world. This us vs them mentality helps no one. It's destructive to everyone. \n\n**Taking responsibility**\n\nWe can't change the world, but we can change ourselves. We can treat our own spouses in a manner where we work together, our positives balance out the negatives of our spouses. We encourage and support one another and live a great life. The key to this in a world gone haywire on marriage is to do the exact opposite as what caused the problem to begin with. \n\nThe problem began when the feminist movement sought to liberate women from male oppression. Let's examine this statement without getting sidetracked by whether women were or weren't oppressed in the 50's because that's besides the point. This statement assumes that traditional marriage is oppressive to women and that men are the oppressors. It seeks to pit men and women against one another, thus breaking down the family unity. It also assumes that the old version of marriage was all obligations for women while being all benefits to men. This is not true. As explained above, marriage of old was a trade-off which was actually negotiated in great detail in many cultures. \n\nIf the problem is that people wish to shirk responsibility while reaping the full benefits, the solution is to do the opposite, to provide the full benefits by fulfilling our full responsibility without expecting immediate returns. Many of the seasoned women here can attest to their successes which occurred only after they were consistent in sticking to their end of the deal while giving their men the space to catch up when they were ready. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nAsk not what my husband\/wife can do for me, ask what you can do for them. Live your married life in full devotion to your spouse without expectation of anything in return. \n\nIf a period of time passes and they are only taking and taking and are taking you for granted, perhaps it's time to consider divorce. When the basics of the marriage are in place but your guys just got a little sidetracked in the bickering, one spouse can break the vicious cycle by doing their part consistently. The other spouse will usually catch up after a few months. However, if they don't catch up and just take you for granted, it may be a sign that the foundations are shattered beyond repair. \n\nTake a step forward and improve your marriage today! If you aren't married yet, take a step forward and improve your RMV today!\n\nCheers!\n\n ","title":"Entitlement","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/63bhbz\/entitlement\/"}

Therefore, there isn't such a thing as the most objectively beautiful woman in the world. Nonetheless, many woman wish to be the most beautiful in the eyes of their beholder. A more beautiful woman then themselves can sometimes bring out deep insecurities and fear of abandonment. \n\nI'd like to attempt to quell some of these fears. \n\n**Male and female sexual attraction and strategy**\n\nMen and women aren't attracted to the same physical features and character traits. Some times, we are even attracted to opposite things. A very common mistake is to assume that what you're attracted to is what s\/he is attracted to and act accordingly, often with disastrous results. Here are a few examples. \n\n1) Men are attracted to submissive women who will defer to their opinion. Many men offer the same kind of respect to their woman by deferring to whatever she wants. Problem is that she is attracted to a leader and sees his deference as him being incapable of making up his mind. \n\n2) Women are attracted to a strong leader, a captain of his ship. Many woman offer the same kind of \"strong independent woman leadership\" to their men. The men however see this behavior as bossy and unattractive. \n\n3) Men are attracted to kindness in a woman. Many men offer their woman an extra dose of kindness. Yes is the default answer to all her requests. This may be a turnoff for her because she may see this as him lacking a backbone. Indeed, a man can be too nice (many men have a very hard time accepting this).\n\n4) Women are attracted to men who set boundaries and lay down the law. Many women offer this to their men, they lay down the law with regards to many areas of life. This may be a turnoff to the men who may find these women to be too stiff and no fun to be around. \n\nMany more examples can be brought in. The point is that we are often attracted to different or even opposite things. \n\nThe reasons we get together with one another are also different for men and women. Therefore, the motivation to keep working on the relationship will differ as well. Here are some examples.\n\n**Choosing a mate**\n\nWomen are the gatekeepers of sex, men are the gatekeepers of commitment. In RP lingo - men have higher RMV while women have higher SMV. This is simple economics of supply and demand. While men and women both want sex and a committed relationship, men want sex more and women want commitment more. This is explained iin my post on [SMV & RMV] (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5j2g6t\/smv_rmv\/)\n\nA man is therefore the \"owner\" of commitment and the women is the \"buyer\". A women is the \"owner\" of sex and the man is the \"buyer\". This means that the man has to provide the woman with a good relationship in exchange for sex, while the woman has to provide the man with good sex in exchange for a commitment. Of course, we try to stay as far away from tit for tat behavior as possible, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that no exchange at all transpires here. Just look at the dead bedrooms sub and you'll see how things go when one partner feels like they're putting in way more than they're taking out. Both men and women become miserable when this barter exchange is off kilter. \n\nBecause the man owns the commitment and the woman owns the sex, they will each approach both of these concepts differently. Because their individual needs are different, they will choose differently. \n\nA woman needs to obtain the guy with the most stability. For this she needs a man who is intelligent and strong. A man who can protect her and make her feel safe and secure both physically and emotionally. **Therefore, the more stability he can provide, the more attractive he is**. If she's with a strong man and she encounters a stronger man, she may be very tempted to branch swing because the new guy is more attractive. (Of course, she can stop herself from doing so). We call this hypergamy. \n\nA man needs to be sexually fulfilled in quantity as well as quality. For this he needs a woman to whom he's sexually attracted and who has a strong sexual desire for him. He needs someone who is enjoyable to be with in bed and who fulfills his sexual needs. Once he has that woman, **he doesn't need a woman who's more beautiful because being more beautiful doesn't add any value to fulfilling his quantitative and qualitative needs**. \n\nIn other words - a more attractive man is potentially more valuable to a woman. A more attractive woman isn't more valueble to a man unless the only thing of value he's getting from her is sex. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nYou don't need to be the most beautiful woman in the world because he doesn't think the way you do. It's okay if you're just beautiful in his eyes. He may lie to please you by telling you that you're the most beautiful woman in the world, but is that what you really want?\n\nOf course, how can I end this post without this [awesome video] (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dlZsGpWJmos) from Prager University. \n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n","title":"The most beautiful woman in the world!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5pm5az\/the_most_beautiful_woman_in_the_world\/"}

I found responses on my last post to be so helpful, that I think I'll keep checking back here for accountability and advice. Since my last post, I've realized that I have a tendency to be ungrateful at times and want what I can't have. I'm sincerely working on this by expressing gratitude to my husband, so I want to thank you all for the advice. \n\nSince that post, I've been doing some reflecting on what's on my side of the street and what's on his. I'm fully into Laura Dyole and taking accountability. However, I don't want that to cross into codependency where I'm taking responsibility for my husband's shortcomings. Now onto the problem that's on his side of the street: \n\nMy husband has anger issues. He has never hit me or laid his hands on me, and I know he wouldn't. However, he does yell and raise his voice a lot. We were dating for 3 years before engagement, and he did not start doing this until we were engaged and toward the end of planning the wedding. Our first real fight was right before the wedding and he completely lost his temper at me, screaming and red in the face, yelling f-you. This broke my heart so much but he promised to never do it again... and I believed him.\n\nOf course, this was not the last time he lost his temper at me. There have been many times when he screamed at me at the top of his lungs. At first, I would just cry and feel helpless and heartbroken. Unfortunately, after a while of this, I started yelling back. I know this is bad, but my reaction to being screamed at is to defend myself. \n\nIt started with him only yelling at me during arguments. But lately I've been noticing his everyday tone with me is off. He raises his voice at me a lot even when we're not arguing. I've also started hearing frequent annoyance toward me in his voice. It's been happening increasingly often. \n\nAt first when I noticed his tone being very harsh with me, I would try to endlessly ask why he's talking to me like that and what I did, because I wanted to solve the problem. He would always respond, \"this is just how I talk.\" I would then go into explanation on why this hurts my feelings, why I wish he would stop, and how badly it makes me feel. Unfortunately, this would make things worse. This would anger him and make him raise his voice even more... sometimes escalating to a full blown fight. Then he would usually ignore me for a while which hurts even more.\n\nHere is what happened last night and what I did instead. \\*I simply withdrew my energy from him...\\* the opposite of what I did before. Instead of asking him what's bothering him, asking what I did, and overexplaining why his tone of voice hurts, I simply said, \"I'm not going back and forth with you right now. I won't talk about this.\" Then, I went off to do self care for the rest of the night. I snuggled in bed and read a book. I gave him 0 energy or affection. We usually talk over text all day and talk about our days, but I have not texted him at all today. I've instead been focusing on myself.\n\nWhen this happened last night, the conversation went like this... Me: \"Hey Rob, did you mail the rent check yet? It hasn't come out of our bank account.\" Him: \"No I haven't.\" Me: \"When we mail the rent check late, it makes it hard for me to keep track of the bills, because sometimes I think it's come out and we overdraw.\" Him (getting immediately angry:) \"Then why don't you do it?!?!?\" Me: \"Because the checks are in your name and I'm worried if it's rejected because I wrote it, we will be charged a fee.\" Him: \\*starts raising his voice at me ang going off on me while I sat there\\* Me: \"I'm not going back and forth with you. I'm going to go read my book.\" Then I left the room.\n\nNow I had a realization today. Like I said, my husband always would say to me, \"this is just how I talk. I'm not yelling at you and I'm not irritated.\" However, \\*he only talks to me like this when it's just us two. He never talks to me in this tone in front of our friends and family.\\* Also the fact that he NEVER spoke to me like this while we were dating. This makes me suspect that he knows what he's doing. He says things like, \"what?? You want me to talk soflty to you like you're a baby?\" It really hurts.\n\nLastly... I was diagnosed as autistic this year and this was a shock to us both. To be 100% honest, I've noticed his tone has gotten worse with me since my diagnosis. Part of being autistic is not understanding people's tones, but I'm not stupid. I can tell if he is being rude versus nice. I can tell if the way he talks to me has changed. I can see him roll his eyes at me and laugh meanly.\n\nAt the same time, since being diagnosed, I've really done a lot to improve my life. I'm finally going into a gainful career, have been working out and eating healthy every day, got my routine together, and really feel like I'm in such a better place mentally than I was at this time last year. Yet his mean tone intensifies even though I'm doing so much better with myself.\n\nSo my question is, how do I handle this? Since trying to communicate and tell him how badly this hurts doesn't work, I withdrew my energy from him. I seriously don't even want to have sex with him. Am I taking the right approach by withdrawing my energy and focusing on self care when he raises his voice or speaks with annoyance to me?","title":"My husband's tone and temper are ruining my attraction to him.

Ask him to establish roles between you two. Ask him enough ahead of time, before events or shared commitments. You can add your input, but avoid deciding, dampening, or brushing off his ideas.\n\n2. Identify when you are the most sad. When you are in a bad mood, this turns him away from you to seek other mood-lightening distractions. You may be your most sad before your period, after you see your mother, or during exam season. Make it a priority to identify those patterns, and make a hardy plan towards mitigating them for yourself. Share successes below!\n\n3. Give him more of what you want to receive. This sounds counterintuitive, because we want him to do all the 'right' things, first. But if you buy him more gifts, give him more compliments, or clean up after him - this might invite the idea into your relationship that you can do these things for one another.\n\n4. Every night before bed, massage his feet\/calves\/arms\/shoulders (whatever he works with the most). Just start doing it every night from now on without a special announcement. \n\n5. Have an iron backbone. Respect yourself, adorn yourself, forgive yourself. Stop speaking ill of yourself or dwelling on your past mistakes. Just stop! Do not agree with him, or with anyone, if they ever say insulting words towards you. Practice saying \" I think you meant ..... because I am not as you said.\"\n\n6. Don't make jokes on his expense in front of others. Even if he laughs, says it's okay, or reciprocates. If you can't meet your friends without letting some slip, literally bite your tongue. If your humor exposes him when you drink, don't drink anymore.","title":"How to make HIM the leader - not you - fast!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/188qrxb\/how_to_make_him_the_leader_not_you_fast\/"}

Personally, that\u2019s why I stumbled upon the redpill a few years ago and, although it was helpful for me, I think it would be interesting to talk into detail about a common experience (imo) among women.\n\nI am talking about the situation where two people are casually dating and the woman (sometimes it\u2019s the man but we are rpW so that\u2019s what I am going to talk about) starts wanting something more after a while, while the man avoids commitment. \n\nMany people say that you must be stupid for ending up in a situation like this and \u201ctrying to fuck him until he develops feelings\u201d and although I agree, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. Let me paint you the scenery:\n\nBoy meets girl and they start talking. Maybe go out on a few dates. It is common for men to say in the beginning \u201cwe\u2019ll get to know each other and see how it goes\u201d. You say yes because what can you answer? I want a serious relationship with you from the first date? You don\u2019t even know the guy.\n\nAnd then they try to get in your pants, you give in because you like them, you start developing feelings and once you gather the courage to have \u201cthe talk\u201d about \u201cwhere this is going\u201d he says that he is not in a place in his life now for something serious and he needs to figure things out, maybe he\u2019ll be ready after a while.\n\nHe uses excuses such as work and having gotten out of a serious relationship recently and sometimes he is so sweet with you that you feel like things are progressing, so you want to believe him and you stay a bit longer, in hopes that something changes (and because that\u2019s now the normal for you since it always happens like that). I mean you\u2019ve met his friends you go to the movies together, that means it\u2019s going forward, right?\n\nAfter a few more weeks\/months you either leave because you can\u2019t keep hurting or he starts getting tired of you, so he reaches out less and less and if you don\u2019t get the hint he gradually ghosts you. \n\nAfter a while, he meets another girl (mind you, she is not necessarily prettier or nicer to him) and they get in a relationship almost immediately, while you are once again left wondering what is wrong with you and why you are never seen as a \u201cgirlfriend material\u201d.\n\nYou are nice to them, you are not too promiscuous or too prudish, you really care about them without suffocating them, you are their looksmatch, sex is great and they sometimes even said things like \u201cif I hadn\u2019t just broken up, I know you would be the big relationship of my life\u201d. But why does this happen to you every time?\n\nA tale as old as time.\n\nNow I want to make one observation: when something happens to you all the time, then the common denominator is you. Whether it\u2019s because of the type of men you choose to pursue or how you handle the situation down the line, it is mostly your fault. \n\nThe number one thing I found that helped me personally is that as soon as I start going out with a guy, I make a list in my head about the reasons why I like him. If \u201che likes me back and tries to win me over\u201d is not in the least, then I give it 1-2 more dates to see if anything changes and then I bail.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a type of girl that I\u2019ve noticed who is always seen as a relationship material. It\u2019s not just her bubbly personality, but more of the fact that they are very good at keeping a balance between showing interest and excitement and being clingy. They somehow manage to create an atmosphere of excitement and romance early on.\n\nI\u2019d say that the girl in the FWB situation I described above was the opposite of that, even though she didn\u2019t do one thing specifically that could be pointed out as wrong (except sleeping with him without securing commitment first, although I\u2019ve seen it happen with the \u201crelationship material\u201d type of girls and then a relationship ensues).\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion? What are the two women doing differently? What is the best way to avoid situations like this one?\n\nTL;DR: how come some women are never the one and always get the \u201cI like you a lot and you are an awesome person, but I am not ready to commit right now\u201d without doing anything wrong seemingly and other are always getting the same guys to commit with excitement, even though sometimes they treat them worse?

Since I presently clean for a living, I can't dress up for work, so I've ended up dressing more nicely on the weekends (form-fitting sweater and long black skirt).  On the weekend I often visit a card shop where I am one of very few women in the store and the others wear jeans\/tees.  Lately there was some serious drama at the shop involving my abusive ex-boyfriend and the guys there came to my aid.  One who was only 15 told me that night \"I really respect you, we all do.\"  It shocked me because that's not something I've heard a lot in my lifetime of casual unisex dress (tees, jeans and hoodies).  I think I carry myself somewhat differently when I dress up so that might also be part of it.\n\nThe flipside to the positive is that my good friend (male) who goes to the shop with me complained that my outfits seem like \"peacocking\" and that they are too dressy for the venue.  He seemed to think there was something embarrassing or cringy about it.  I told him I don't care if he thinks it's embarrassing because 1.) *I* like it and 2.) years ago in America men and women used to dress up for any public social gathering as a sign of respect.   (I wish more men in the shop would make a similar effort, they would look a lot nicer.)\n\nSo, just wanted to thank everyone who responded to my original post.

This strategy also applies to after work happy hour.\n\nHowever, there are other events, like bachelor parties and boys' weekends where I like to apply **Strategy 2: Just One Sext**. Basically, I either send a hot selfie, reminding him what's waiting for him at home, or I drop the raunchiest description possible of what's waiting at home. The key is that I hit Send, and then put down my phone. I don't badger him all night with text messages, I just put the idea in his head.

He doesn\u2019t make me feel that way, though, just a product of my own insecurities.\n\nWhen he met me, I was failing in school, lazy, unmotivated, undisciplined, kinda depressed, no cooking skills, jobless, no friends, etc. One year later, I went back to school and finished this semester with straight A\u2019s purely because of his encouragement and I admire and am inspired by him a lot. I developed my cooking skills to a beginner level and also started developing my creativity through hobbies. I got a (degree-less) job in childcare and have been really excelling in that, which does not go unnoticed by my boyfriend. I have a more consistent work out routine now, have a good group of female friends and one close female friend, and am generally more positive than I was when we met. He\u2019s noticed, supported, and congratulated me on all of my progress and growth.\n\nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, is the smartest and most masculine man I\u2019ve ever met, an IQ of around 140, completed two degrees in 3 years from a prestigious university, traveled and lived all over the world, he\u2019s fit, attractive, funny, sexy, a great cook, great at anything he does\/picks up, extremely driven, wealthy upbringing, etc. His mother was also the perfect homemaker growing up, practically cooking up 5 star meals, and his dad is a very important man.\n\nIt\u2019s a little intimidating at times. I\u2019m very middle class and I\u2019m embarrassed at how much that shows sometimes, but he seems to think it\u2019s cute and that I\u2019m cute, even though I\u2019m pretty average, and just above average when I make the effort. He\u2019s been in relationships with two gorgeous women and I\u2019m not sure I can ever compete with that. He\u2019s excited about our future and building a family with me and he\u2019s told me I would make a great mother. However, I\u2019m not sure I can ever live up to his mom\u2019s perfect homemaking, although he\u2019s told me that I don\u2019t need to and that he doesn\u2019t think about that. He\u2019s so encouraging and really believes in me and doesn\u2019t have one ill thought towards me.\n\nBut I feel like an imposter. I feel like anyone can clearly see he\u2019s too good for me. When I met him, he was recovering from an abusive relationship with his ex. And I can\u2019t help thinking I\u2019m just the first normal girl he\u2019s met and liked since getting out of his past relationship. That I was there at the right place at the right time in his life. That if he stayed single longer, he would\u2019ve found a prettier, more educated, more qualified woman who would be more on his level. Sorry for such a long post... How can I help this? I never told him all of this because I don\u2019t want to accidentally self-sabotage this relationship because of my insecurities.","title":"My boyfriend is so high caliber, I think he\u2019s too good for me.

But I'm reposting them as foundational content after talking with** u\/pearlsandstilettos **I will try to post a new chapter every few days instead of every week, and we can probably get through the whole thing in a month.**\n\nWelcome RPW. My name is JanuaryArya and I\u2019ve made a resolution to lead a book club of Fascinating Womanhood. I made a post a few weeks ago that garnered some interest and here we are. I want to clarify a misconception that I held. I though I had already read \u201cFascinating Womanhood\u201d but the truth is that I read \u201cThe Secrets of Fascinating Womanhood\u201d\n\nI would like to clarify that the book to be following along with will be [Fascinating Womanhood](http:\/\/a.co\/d\/bjGWTwB): The Updated Edition of the Classic Bestseller That Shows You How to Strengthen Your Marriage and Enrich Your Life by Helen Andelin. I bought the Kindle Version on Amazon\n\nThis edition starts with a quote by one of my favorite authors:\n\n>\u201dThere is in this world no function more important than that of being charming, to shed joy around, to cast light upon dark days\u2026 is not this to render a service?\u201d Victor Hugo\n\nThe introduction urges you to consider your happiness and hopes in your marriage. Is your marriage as brilliant and intimate as it possible could be? Have you settled for the state of current affairs? How do you define happiness within a marriage? I know that we are not all married, some of us are even single. I still think that the content of this book is relevant. Take what applies to you and leave the rest behind. That being said, there are many references in this book to \u201chusbands\u201d and marriage. I tried to change some of the wording to \u201cCaptain\u201d the term that is often discussed here on RPW, but I tried to avoid it for direct quotes.\n\n## Fascinating Womanhood will teach you how to be happy in your Marriage.\n\nThere are three essentials in reaching this goal:\n\n1. Love: How we awaken our Captain\u2019s love is by A) Not doing things which diminish his love, and B) doing more things that awaken his love. \u201cIn most cases a man stops loving a woman after marriage because she stops doing things which arouse his feelings\u201d Modern society may be at odds with natural feminine instincts so we need to look back to cherishing and cultivating our feminine nature.\n2. Self Dignity: How do you react and respond to your Captain, and the world around you? Men aren\u2019t interested in ugly tempers, or meekness. We must strive to find a balance, and deal with conflict appropriately. The concept of \u201cchildlike anger\u201d will be explored further in the reading.\n3. Desires: Your desires in life and in marriage aren\u2019t selfish, and worthy desires should be attainable. \u201cYou may have gone without these things for years because you didn\u2019t know how to motivate your Captain to do these things for you\u201d People love those that they serve, and your Captain does delight in providing you your desires, allowing him to do so will benefit his nature as well.\n\n## This book will explore the Ideal Woman from a Man\u2019s point of view.\n\n>\u201dWithin your reach is the possibility of a happy marriage. You can bring it about independent of any effort on the part of your husband. So, you hold the keys to your own happiness.\u201d\n\n## What this Book Can Do For You:\n\nIt will teach you:\n\n1. The Ideal Woman from a man\u2019s point of View\n2. What men find fascinating in women.\n3. How to awaken a man\u2019s deepest feeling of love and tenderness.\n4. How to understand men\n5. How to treat a man\n6. How to cause a man to protect you, provide for you, and devote himself to you.\n7. How to obtain those things in life which you desire\n8. How to bring out the best in your Captain\n9. The feminine role, and the happiness that comes with its fulfillment\n10. The masculine role, and the respect due\n11. How to react to conflict\n12. How to be attractive\n13. How to communicate in marriage\n14. How to gain true happiness in marriage\n\n## Up Next:\n\nBuy the Book and get ready to follow along.\n\nRead Chapter 1: Celestial Love for next Week.","title":"Revisiting Fascinating Womanhood: Introduction","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/mni43k\/revisiting_fascinating_womanhood_introduction\/"}

It is strongly inferred that by the time they reached the White House, Nancy was the one who ran the show behind the scenes and that both of them liked it that way. Where RR was the most charming, charismatic, congenial person you could imagine, it also made him somewhat overly trusting at times and she always had his back. They even compare her to a \u201cmafia don\u201d within the administration! Very much a gatekeeper to her husband\u2019s power. \n\nHe brought the raw talent (and plenty of ambition of his own) and he knew she could help him harness it. RR was the actor, and Nancy was his producer - emphasizes to me how well they worked together as a team.\n\nIn the public eye, Nancy was very much the adoring, demure wife; it is very clear that she was super well-respected and influential among RR\u2019s political advisers, but she never flaunted that. She knew the outward appearance (and inward dynamic) of their traditional marriage played into RR\u2019s image as a strong, masculine, squeaky clean, aspirational American hero upon which he built his political career.\n\nI love how she was super smart, his greatest adviser and basically the strategist behind the operation, her strength; while \u201cthe great communicator\u201d, lover of the spotlight, capitalized on his major talents to rally support for their message and influence\/unify the masses - to lead. The two of them learned to work in lock-step, cooperate, and leverage their strengths and cover each other\u2019s weaknesses to accomplish far more together than either of them could have individually (or likely with a different spouse).\n\nWhat really drives it home to me as a true partnership that I aspire to, is how Nancy\u2019s influence was not a well-known thing at the time outside their inner circle, and has been brought more to light by historians later. The woman didn\u2019t need to claim credit or pursue a political career of her own. She found her fulfillment in making her husband the biggest success he could be, and that is just so relatable to me - I absolutely love when my husband asks for my advice or support with his career, and I get so much more out of supporting him and helping him grow than I do personally working in my own professional career (which is a necessity for the time being). It feels so much more natural to be a nurturing presence for him than to be out there in corporate America on my own.\n\nJust wanted to share, it is an interesting watch so far and made me want to discuss! \u263a\ufe0f","title":"Nancy Reagan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/l82en1\/nancy_reagan\/"}

I'd initially accepted (due to reading and learning the manosphere perspective) that my SMV was a thing of the past and decided to enjoy friendships and interesting conversations with men and leave it at that, as I have plenty on my plate as a widowed mother of two.\n\nThen, within the last six months or so, I began slimming down considerably without even trying (due to learning my younger daughter was prediabetic and making major changes in our eating habits and exercising more), and I started feeling an overwhelming desire to find a man whom I could be a real help, comfort, and support to in all the ways that a woman should serve a man, including sexually. I also feel a strong desire for my girls to see me in a truly happy and joyful relationship with a man; I think this may help them rethink the feminism that they're currently embracing.\n\nI understand that just because I feel the desire, this doesn't mean I'm entitled to a man, so I've just been praying about it and continuing to work on myself and endeavoring to be as in-shape and pretty as I can be in my advanced years. We've also moved and, as of one month ago, have been sharing a house owned by my brother with one of his best friends -- a man just three years older than me. My brother had suggested that his friend and I, both having small incomes, could each live more comfortably and make ends meet more easily if we shared a home, and he felt that we were two people who could get along well as roommates.\n\nIt's been working out well so far, and in the process of getting to know one another, I've become strongly attracted to this man. I understand that wearing my heart on my sleeve would make things enormously awkward if he doesn't end up feeling the same way. And also that rushing into anything would be a huge mistake, especially as I'm a mother and have to set an example for my daughters and put their wellbeing first.\n\nSo I'm just prayerfully learning about this man's perspective on so many things pertaining to life and relationships. He's not at all a feminist, and has pretty openly volunteered information about some things he does and doesn't find attractive in women. He's also shared that his last girlfriend was 16 years younger than him, and is unashamedly open about his preference for hot young women -- which I concede is perfectly natural, as the male sex drive is largely about the man ensuring his immortality by mating with the youngest, most fertile and beautiful women he can get; even if a man has no desire mentally to father more children, a young, fertile woman is still what his body is craving and is naturally what he's most attracted to.\n\nSo I've decided that since I feel he's worthy of all my efforts -- he's worth it even with the risk of him never wanting me that way -- I'm just continuing to focus on improving myself and being a good friend to him. When he first moved in (after we'd been here about a month and a half) and I offered him foods I'd prepared, he said we could each fend for ourselves, and I said that was fine but he was always welcome to anything in the fridge (he doesn't enjoy cooking). I even commented that I'd missed having a man to cook and do little things for (trying to just be matter-of-fact and not forward), and he has quickly become comfortable with eating my cooking and seems to enjoy it, and also comfortable with letting me wait on him, bring him a cup of coffee, and so on. \n\nSo I've decided to look at this as a win-win situation for me. It's certainly a win if he ever returns my feelings, although if he ever brings it up, I'll need to tell him that the only man I've been with sexually was my husband, and that for me, sex is two people becoming one, so whether or not there's ever a piece of paper, in my heart, it would essentially be a marriage. So he shouldn't get involved with me without really wanting that kind of relationship himself.\n\nAt the same time, it's also a win even if he never returns my feelings, because just receiving his occasional appreciative glance or comment is really motivating me to watch what I eat and keep up my daily hula hooping routine, as well as be attentive to my personal grooming at all times. So I'll be a healthier and better woman just through knowing him.\n\nJust starting this thread for advice (male advice is also quite welcome if any man happens to read this) and to encourage others to share their stories. I may be the oldest woman reading\/posting here, but if there are other women like me who saw the light after \"hitting the wall,\" I hope you'll feel welcome to chime in and know you're not alone.","title":"Becoming Red Pill as an Older Woman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/bvo6pn\/becoming_red_pill_as_an_older_woman\/"}

This isn't objectively true, but it is the way men view themselves and the way that women view men. Men must accomplish and achieve to become a something. Hence why men are human **doings.**\n\nIn other words \\- men operate from an emotional deficit, from minus zero.\n\nThe male world is also a strict meritocracy. Fake achievement means nothing and your feelings be damned. Higher achievement is more valued than lower achievement. So when a man tries to become a someone, his budding ego will constantly be knocked down by men and women alike.\n\n**Male sexual desire**\n\nIf not for the extremely powerful male sexual desire, men would never interact with women, **ever!** Men and women are so different and hardly relate to one another. We're like foreign creatures who are annoying and who we can hardly relate to. So why bother with them at all? Add to that the male propensity to be alone and the question intensifies, why would a man ever interact with a woman?\n\nBecause sexual desire. That's why. Sexual desire in men is so strong that it'll override all logic and reason and draw a man towards a sexually appealing woman.\n\nThis desire tugs at men constantly. When he encounters an eligible woman, his eyes will take in her boobs\/butt\/figure and all kinds of things start firing in his head within a split second, **before he's even conscious of having seen her**. Only then can he avert his eyes\/mind\/attention elsewhere. Most men have good reason to avert their attention most of the time. Most men do this most of the time. It can be a battlefield in the male mind just walking down the street. Especially for young men. This may sound crazy to women, but it's true nonetheless.\n\nAdd this intense sexual desire to the feeling of being worthless described above and the man who dares to approach a woman is operating from an exponential emotional deficit!\n\n**Gatekeepers of sex**\n\nIt's therefore no wonder why women hold all the sexual cards. The male desire for sex is that much more powerful \\+ the male sense of worthlessness is ever present = a desperate need for female sexual desire and general approval of character.\n\nWhen a man approaches you, every rational fiber of his being is telling him not to take the risk. His little head is what's driving him to you. This is as true for couples who are married for decades as it is for singles looking for a mate.\n\nWhen a woman is not interested she thinks, no big deal, I'm just not interested. But to the man who approached her, he just put his whole being on the line and was tossed away. This is an unavoidable part of life that every man will experience many times. It's important for women to understand the power that they hold so they can use it constructively. Application of this idea will be a topic of a different post.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMen operate from a double deficit 1. An overwhelming sexual desire 2. The sense of worthlessness being the default. Therefore, women are the gatekeepers of sex.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit - [back to the basics -  men are the gatekeepers of commitment] (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8epbgq\/back_to_the_basics_men_are_the_gatekeepers_of\/)","title":"Back to the basics - women are the gatekeepers of sex.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8dgnhj\/back_to_the_basics_women_are_the_gatekeepers_of\/"}

It is used here to describe understanding male\/female dynamics, it\u2019s used in other groups to describe understanding politics. Using this metaphor, blue pilled people are suffering under a false understanding of the world. This is all fine as a way of understanding people\u2019s worldview. What it is not ok to do, is to assume that a red pill person is *always* good and blue pill person is *always* bad.  \n\nWe\u2019ve discussed on occasion that many men *who would not consider themselves to be red pilled* still see what is going on in the world. I saw a comment today that indicated that women who are past the wall might have to *settle for blue pilled men*. I believe this is a wildly incorrect way of looking at non-red pill men and an incredibly dismissive way to view men in general. \n\nMy blue pilled boss: \n\nI work for a man who was primarily raised by a single mother after his father took off. He\u2019s economically conservative and socially liberal. He is a natural Alpha and this is obvious watching him interact with the men involved in his primary hobby. He is the leader in his family even though his wife supported them while he built his business and it\u2019s unlikely they would be where they are if they weren\u2019t a team. He is training me to \u2018inherit\u2019 his business when he retires but he also watches me walk to my car when we work past dark. He has never advised a male client not to marry, and I\u2019ve seen him advise a female client to protect her assets with a prenup when the time comes.  \n\nHe would be appalled at some of the things that are said on TRP. This isn\u2019t an insult to TRP. This is the result of *his* values from being raised by a single mother, having a strong wife and raising a strong daughter. I think of him when I see the idea that blue pilled men are somehow lesser men and I know it\u2019s not entirely accurate.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there\u2019s a reason why women *here* are often cautioned to *stay off* the male RP subs as well. The goals here are generally different from the most popular goals on TRP and askTRP. Even though MRP focuses exclusively on marriage, the community there deals with very different issues. The male subs are not moral or immoral, good or bad, but to non-RP folks (like my boss), it\u2019s easy to see *why* from their perspective, many behaviors and ideas *are* judged through a morality lens. \n\nSo today I ask RPW to stop thinking of men in black and white (or Red and Blue) terms. There are good men out there. What we say around here about relationship dynamics and red pill beliefs does not mean that we are tied to finding only red pill aware men. There are good men and bad men. There are men who will be able to lead and men who will never want to lead. \n\nLook for a man who you are compatible with and attracted to. If we hold too firmly to the red\/blue divide it stops being a praxeology and starts being yet another way to categorize and sort people. We have enough of that these days. \n","title":"Beyond Red & Blue","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/7hzdnk\/beyond_red_blue\/"}

The other day my SO and I were sitting in the car talking and he casually mentioned how one of his friends said he would never date a girl who couldn't accept that he smokes. At that moment I realize he was shit testing me. I kinda of chuckled because    I started to remember all the shit test we had before we were dating.\nHow hard I guess he vetted me as well. As a side note, my boyfriend doesn't smoke cigarettes when we started dating he vaped, but he decided to quit on his own. After this I realized something about my boyfriend. His shittest are always testing me over three things money, loyalty, and pressure.\n\n**Money**\n\nI know money is something very important to my boyfriend. He is a natural provider and he has made my life significantly better. However, his desire to provide for me did not happen after we had sex or even after we started dating. It happen after I started to pass his shittest about money. \n\n1. He paid for all of my food , but always gave me a chance to help pay\n\n2. He offers to buy me something more expensive, I offer for something cheaper\n\n3.When we moved in together, he let me decide how I wanted the rent to be split\n\nIn all of these situation he gave me an opportunity to show how I will use his money if he became a provider for me. Everytime I passed a test he will be more willing to do things and take the next step in our relationship. A lot of time I did not realize he was testing me, but I glad my values on money align so much with him.\n\n**Loyalty**\n\nJust like the money one, he would put me in situation and see how I act.\n\n1. One time he asked me if I wanted to go clubbing with my friends without him\n\n2. He also asked me my opinions on certain redpill topics like male friends, sleeping around, and marriage (SO does not read Redpill or really knows anything about it)\n\nJust like money he will usually pose a situation to me and see how I react. \n\n**Control**\n\nEveryone is constantly changing and so am I. We are both way different people from when we first met. Because of the changes he made in our life. My boyfriend likes to see how much pressure I would put on him in a certain way. This brings us back to the whole smoking thing I never ask him to stop. I just told him if he wanted to quit I would totally support him. I don't pressure him to do anything he  doesn't want to do. If there is a problem I dislike [I bring him the problem and  not the solution](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4i8ukh\/bring_your_captain_your_problem_not_your_solution\/)\n By doing this I guess in essence I am holding my frame.

The general consensus is that men prefer natural women. \n\nBe careful, my fellow RPW! It's a trap.\n\n-----\n\n* **Why it's a trap** \n\nWhen men say they want natural women they mean *naturally beautiful women.* \n\nThey want those genes that give you perfect complexion, long eyelashes, full luscious lips naturally so he can be sure you are a great mating prospect. \nWhen you \"cake\" your face you are hiding the truth about your genes and this gives men mating anxiety. They don't like being lied to. \n\n\n-----\n\n* **The catch**\n\nMen value women 99% on looks. Telling a girl to be natural is, in other words telling her: *\"I know you can raise your value by 250%, but please don't and be honest, ok?\"*\n\nThe question is if men could spend 15 min. in the morning doing an activity that skyrockets their SMV and status almost instantly would they do it? \nI bet they would.\n\n-----\n\n* **The morality of \"Too much makeup**\n\nI saw that many women feel guilty looking like something they are not and I understand this because I was like this too. When I started overdrawing my lips I felt like a cheater. This is our sense of morality kicking in. \n\nWe don't like to be fake because it's not fair, it's false advertising. **Problem is we're trying to play fair when the game is rigged.** \n\nI am judged on something I have no control over like the length of my face or the distance between my eyes. Let's quickly review the \"game\" or \"the system\", whatever you want to call it.\n\nLet's say I was born with a long face, ugly \"witch\" nose and no chin. Amanda was born with cute nose, long legs and baby-face. Now let's start on our paths...\n\n> Amanda wins.\n\nUm..what? But I didn't do anything...\n\n> Sorry, Amanda wins. \n\nBut...I worked hard to...\n\n> Amanda is better, bye. \n\nThe game is not fair in the slightest. You are what you are born with, your face\/body influences everything in your life from the day you are born, your interactions, your thoughts, your value. And here we are, on r\/RedPillWomen trying to play nicely a game that is rigged from day 1. \n\n-----\n\n* **Ok, cristiana33, I should cake myself in make-up and call it a day, that's what your saying.**\n\nNo, no, no. If you are naturally beautiful I think mascara and some lipgloss are enough. \n\nI wouldn't do much if I had a naturally great looking face. But not all of us are naturally beautiful, for example I am not. \n\nWhat I am challenging here is the \"morality\" of too much makeup and our (foolish) desire to play \"fair\". Our morality which tells us \"maybe I shouldn't deceive people\". Well they will deceive you and will not lose much sleep over it. Men will call you ugly in your face and won't care that you didn't hide those blemishes because you wanted to be \"morally correct\". \n\nThey'll call you ugly and turn their back on you. \n\n-----\n\n* **So how much make-up??**\n\nHow much you want. How much you feel comfortable with. None at all if you don't want to. \n\nBut NEVER try to be \"natural\" for the sake of morality. That's foolish. \n\n\n* **But how about when he sees me without make-up?**\n\nIf you have naturally pleasant features you're fine. No woman is as beautiful without make-up and nobody expects you to be. If your face is unattractive w\/o make-up wake-up early and put your \"minimal face\" on before he wakes up. Simple. \n\nWomen have been doing this for decades before feminism and laziness kicked in. \n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion:** You can play fair all you want, the system is cruel. You are judged on things that you have no control over. Your desire to be \"natural because you don't want to deceive\" can be detrimental in the path for success. \n\n**TLDR;** What men actually want is naturally beautiful women. If you're not one of them use all the tools you have to raise your SMV and feel absolutely no shame about it. \n\n\n\n","title":"Men say: \"We prefer natural women\". Do they really?

You are now in the fringes of society. We advocate to cast the widest net in order to ensure that you are attracting enough men to be able to find a GOOD man quicker. That goes for all superficial questions. \n\nThe looks department is **not** the most important part of RPW. Attraction is important but it will fade away. You will be old, wrinkly, wearing support hose and orthopedic shoes alone with your ten wiener dogs if you have a stank attitude. \n\nWhat we strive for here is cultivating the right mindset.

When we fell for each other, we fell hard, and started talking marriage and family right away. \n\nWe already had a business together, were already very close friends, and were already involved. So when we decided we were ready to call it love and make a future out of it, things got real fast. He has gone through so much personal growth this year. I know that my ability to use my femininity as a soft landing place for him has been instrumental. He went from a smart, talented, and kind person who was also a bit bitter and escapist, to an incredibly driven, hardworking man who is open to influence and is fixed on seeing things as they really are. He has some huge aspirations for life, and now he really believes he can achieve them. \n\nAnd once I had permission not to do the career path I was \u201csupposed\u201d to do, I found work that I really liked and broke through my unemployment slump with his support. I now have no problem admitting that although I have this advanced degree, my main calling in life is to be a wife and mother. I will work on the side to help the family or as a hobby, but my work will be far second to my true calling, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nI am not an ideal bride by any means. And he\u2019s not a perfect man. But we emphasize each other\u2019s strengths, complement each other\u2019s weaknesses, and are constantly striving to grow. Personal growth is a very RP, very anti-victimhood concept, and we could not have this relationship without it. We have a wonderful life ahead of us!\n\nThank you for helping to make this possible!\n","title":"I am engaged!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/2wl44t\/i_am_engaged\/"}

As such, I thought I'd try to address some of the misconceptions around what RPW is in relation to other popular women\u2019s coaching communities such as Female Dating Strategy (FDS) and Vindicta, or collectively in the pill-sphere have come to be known as \u201cPink Pill.\u201d\n\n# What is the Pink Pill?\n\nThis belief system acknowledges the stated male nature of red pill, but does not concern itself with female nature. It focuses on the detriment of male nature to both society and the female imperative, and it tends to attract radical feminists or resource\/provision focused women (what men would normally refer to as a \"gold digger\"). It's normally characterized by:\n\n* Being a \"High Value Woman\" (HVW) or a woman who is beautiful, sociable and has many dating options\n* Insistence of women's independence from, and indifference\/condescension toward, men\n* Heavy emphasis on AMALT (\u201cAll Men Are Like That\u201d) and deriding male nature\n* Vetting for providers and prioritizing wealth in dating prospects (finding a \u201cHigh Value Man\u201d or HVM)\n* Focusing on the transactional aspect of a relationship and maximizing female benefit (i.e \u201csprinkle sprinkle\u201d)\n* \u201cI am the table\u201d kind of attitude when dating\n\nWhile you can begin to see some of the minor overlap with RPW, particularly in being a high value woman and vetting men, i**t\u2019s important to remember that RPW and Pink Pill are NOT the same**. The belief principles are vastly different, and this is reflected in how RPW approaches attitudes of dating and men.\n\n# What Makes RPW Different?\n\n**1) Beliefs on female nature**\n\nBelieving in the red pill is to believe a collection of evo-psych generalities regarding differences between men and women. RPW believes in self-awareness, and that understanding these things will help guide women to a happy and healthy relationship. This includes all of women's flaws such as hypergamous urges, 80\/20, and AWALT (\"All Women Are Like That\") among other things.\n\n**2) Male and female nature have no assigned moral value \u2014 men are** ***not*** **bad**\n\nPink Pill\u2019s heavy emphasis on AMALT and generally the sentiment of \u201cmen bad\u201d isn\u2019t supported by RPW. The gender differences outlined by red pill\u2014the state of how things are\u2014just simply is. To some extent, [male and female imperative are in opposition](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1rpnx3\/toward_a_reconciliation_of_male_and_female_nature\/), but this doesn\u2019t mean men or women are inherently bad\/wrong because of it. They\u2019re different from each other, with some overlap in sexual goals, and it\u2019s our responsibility as women to vet for men who are compatible with us.\n\n**3) \"Men all Bad, Women all Good\" is not only untrue, it's unhelpful**\n\nWe look at each gender's positives AND negatives, without cherry-picking. Women aren't all-powerful, strong, caring, and flawless, and men are not all potential rapists, walking wallets, and worse than the bear. RPW is about using RP (aka TRUTH) to discern what women need to work on, and it looks at what they need to seek in men, when trying to build a positive and lasting relationship - (*addition by* u\/LateralThinker13)\n\n**4) Financial security or a \u201cHVM\u201d is not the only criteria**\n\nPink Pill places extraordinary, exclusive emphasis on male provision and spoiling. That if a man isn\u2019t paying for everything and showering you with gifts, then he\u2019s not serious about you or not committed to being with you. Contrary to this belief, RPW isn\u2019t about finding a wealthy man or even necessarily a provider man. RPW advocates for women to make informed, vetted choices about men in order obtain or improve her goal of marriage. By all means, it\u2019s fine to want financial security in your relationship, but vetting men through whether or not they pay for your pre-date nail appointment is not what RPW is about. [Vetting is a holistic process](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/xf6u2b\/back_to_basics_september_vetting_a_man_part_1\/) that encourages women to choose based on what\u2019s most compatible with them and their life goals.\n\n**5) Being a good partner to have a good partner**\n\nSo much content out there is proclaims that women are \u201cthe table\u201d\\*\\*\\* and warns against being PickMeishas and Barbara the Builders for men. Pink Pill advises that women should abstain from giving \u201cwife treatment\u201d or \u201cauditioning to be a wife,\u201d but RPW believes in bringing value to your man, your relationship, and [incremental reciprocity](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/sc0f8l\/incremental_reciprocation_how_to_minimize_risk\/). You are not a table just because you look good and have confidence. Women, just like men, are responsible for cultivating a relationship in which they\u2019re happy and satisfied. Understanding male and female nature helps women be attractive (both in appearance and behavior) to their men, and how to inspire the kind of treatment you want from your man.  \n  \nEDIT:  \n\\*\\*\\**I am the table* is an answer to the age old \"What do you bring to the table?\" question. It implies women are prizes to be won over, and that it's a man's responsibility to chase and impress her. It assume she brings value to the relationship simply through existing. In contrast, RPW believes that women should bring value to the relationship (\"bringing something to the table\") [through her RMV](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/xa60nr\/back_to_basics_september_the_dangers_of\/)\u2014her femininity, personality, capability, and willingness to be a good partner for a man.\n\nI\u2019m sure there is more to this list, so if you all have any suggestions, feel free to comment them down below!","title":"RPW vs. Pink Pill: Misconceptions and Understanding the Differences","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1eaijky\/rpw_vs_pink_pill_misconceptions_and_understanding\/"}

The First Mate, there to help envision the bigger picture for the family and steer the ship in that direction. A shoulder for the husband to cry on if needed.\n\n**The Waitress** is the cheerful attendant of the husband's daily needs. She makes the food, keeps the man comfortable, and anticipates his needs. She is cute and upbeat, always ready with a smile. Makes the man feel pampered while still feeling masculine.\n\n**The Whore** is the mistress of her man's sexual needs. Her job is to be sexually willing, open, and adventurous. She needs to make him feel wanted--a god among kings. She also provides other sensual comforts like massages. Helps her husband let go and unleash his inner animal.\n\n**The Cheerleader** is the public face of a husband's support from his wife. She too is cheerful, openly supportive of her husband, and helps improve and maintain his public image. She is considered high value by most, and her approval reflects well on her husband.\n\nThank you so much if you have any thoughts to add to any, one, or all of these roles!\n\n","title":"Exploring the five faces of the perfect wife","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1cimji6\/exploring_the_five_faces_of_the_perfect_wife\/"}

We\u2019ve been through some rough patches, like any marriage, but we\u2019ve always come out stronger together. A few years ago, my husband started wearing thongs. I expressed that I didn\u2019t like it and did not find it attractive. He got upset with me and wanted to know why I cared what he wore under his clothes. I\u2019m pretty non-confrontational, so I just kept my opinion to myself afterwards. He started to gain a little weight, then stopped wearing them. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nThe past couple of years have been stressful and hard on our family. My husband wanted to sell our house and build a house on his parent\u2019s land. I was open to this and we went through the difficult process of home selling. We didn\u2019t have the money to immediately start building, so we moved into my Dad\u2019s house for about 6 months. When it was looking like it was going to be longer than we expected, we decided to get an apartment while we saved money to build.\n\nThen the pandemic hit and threw a wrench in our plans. We ended up deciding to just pull the trigger and move in with his parents to start the building process. It was a long and stressful couple of years. We finally got our dream home built and I thought everything would calm down.\n\nSince we have moved into our new home I noticed my husband wearing thongs again. They are getting more and more racy, but I still haven\u2019t said anything because of how he acted last time. \n\nRecently, in a drunken hook up, he admitted to me that he had been trying to get a prostate orgasm, and has been sticking things up there. I was completely shocked. Then I found a basket with lube, dildos, and other paraphernalia. I haven\u2019t confronted him about it, because I\u2019m worried about his answers. \n\nHe used to be so masculine when we were younger, but has become more dependent on my validation of him. I feel myself wearing the pants in our relationship more and more. Making more decisions, even though I have expressed to him that I just want him to make a decision once in a while because I\u2019m so exhausted always being the one that does it. He gets mad saying I never agree with his decisions. I know I have some blame here, but after so many years of carrying the bulk of our relationship, I\u2019m exhausted.\n\nHe has so also started shaving, everywhere. I once made a comment that I like when he is hairier, but he complained that it bothers him. \n\nI just do not understand. Maybe he is bisexual and hiding it. I\u2019m not worried about him being gay, because we still have very enthusiastic sex. He still gives oral and loves it and wants to have sex with me all the time.\n\nI just want him to be more masculine, but I don\u2019t want to immaculate him by telling him that. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving things out, so just ask if you have questions.","title":"How do I get my husband to be more masculine?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1785npw\/how_do_i_get_my_husband_to_be_more_masculine\/"}

She *nags* and *demands* things of my father constantly, to the point that it makes it less pleasant to be around her. She runs the ship. There is no space to question the decisions, she wants you to just obey. My father's spirit in this regard has been crushed for a long time (and surprising no one here, he's never in a hurry to meet her demands so my mother isn't exactly living a joyful life either). \n\nThis is what was modeled for me growing up and even though I've always known deep down (before RPW) that I wanted my husband to *lead me* I fought it in practice. \n\nI first found RPW several years ago when my husband and I were beginning the talk on engagement. I was not a good partner at this time. I nagged. I [shit tested](https:\/\/illimitablemen.com\/2014\/12\/14\/the-shit-test-encyclopedia\/). I picked fights and criticized him constantly. Guys I was *awful*. RPW is what finally made me acknowledge what I knew all along, that if I didn't get my act together I would lose him, and he is *not* a man you'd want to lose. \n\nSo I began implementing the tools. I wanted to really embody the role of [first mate](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/psr3zs\/back_to_basics_september_the_captainfirst_mate\/) (I always did better in support roles despite my mother constantly telling me I was just letting people steamroll me). \n\nIn my experience this piece of advice (bring your problems to your captain, not solutions) works best when your man is already established and comfortable in the captains seat. I started with other changes: knowing when to [STHU](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pwrd5m\/back_to_basics_september_stfu\/), fostering good communication, dropping those shit tests; so that when I tell him I'd like to follow his lead he didn't question me. He steps up right away.\n\nSo fast forward until now, when I can give a field report that I'm so proud of. \n\nWe welcomed a beautiful baby girl several months ago. During my pregnancy it became clear that the area we lived in was getting worse crime wise (there were gunshots every night, drive bys, loud music, people on drugs going in and out of the house across the street...and more). We hadn't planned on moving for a few more years and my husband was putting money away for it. I started getting anxious and wondering what kind of childhood my baby would have. I dreamed of my little ones growing up playing in the yard but who would let their kids do that when there were shoot outs across the street?\n\nFinally one day when an incident big enough to hit the local news happened I broke down and told my husband how I felt. I hated this place, didn't feel safe and wish we could leave. No demands, just an[ open and mature check in.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pu41u9\/back_to_basics_september_the_essential_duties_of\/)\n\nLiterally the next day he started crunching numbers. He made a plan and we have officially moved to a much safer area where gunshots don't wake the baby up. It was not a fun process, moving never is (especially for him balancing all this stuff with his work). But he did it for me, he told me it was important to him I felt safe. I brought him my problem and he took action to fix it. \n\nI think even if I never found RPW and implemented those tools we'd have still gotten married but I honestly don't believe I would have a husband willing to go so far for our family. I think he would have been crushed like my poor father. \n\nI've never made a post before despite participating on other accounts throughout the years, and I'm honestly not sure if anyone will be able to get any insight from this but to be quite honest I wrote this out of happiness. I still have a lot to work on but I'm proud of the results so far. \n\n(P.S I really hope the formatting, especially the links, work okay.

I invited a woman of my trust to be my witness at my legal marriage ceremony and she thought I was crazy and stupid (I wasn\u2019t surprised, later on, I\u2019ll be writing about how socially difficult is to get engaged at 18) so she sent me to the psychology department of a very well known university, a place where I could get psychological attention for a subsided price, I was reluctant to accept but I finally did, of course not because of that, but because I\u2019ve been having problems with eating disorders for over 7 years, and I figured it would be good to get some help for the price they offered. \n\nGreat mistake. \n\nOver the course of the couple of sessions I went to, the female therapist asked me several questions about my life, thoughts, my aspirations for the future, and habits, as soon as she realized I was a traditional values woman, who intended to get married soon,  my anorexia disappeared for her and it was all about curing my traditional-wife-syndrome. Of course not directly, she let me know I had all my 20\u2019s to get things done for me and by myself and then could start looking for a husband, that I needed a career before thinking of having a family, and that, in short, trad-wives were lazy women who wanted a man who satisfied all their needs; and that the picture I had of the ideal future was mediocre. \n\nAnd this one is not just a crazy brainwashed woman that I randomly encounter, the person who recommended me to get psychological help had the exact same ideas. At my local middle school and high school, all (3) the female teachers that studied psychology wanted to indoctrinate us, young girls, into following the same mold: experimenting in our 20\u2019s and then, when we are 30, figure everything out, feminism is a blessing and respecting our partners is overrated. I should have known that it was not going to be any different in a personal session. \n\n**What to expect in an objective and adequate therapy session** \n\nHere is a list of the basic aspects expected in a therapy session according to the guidelines for good psychotherapy dynamic. \n\n* *Respect for your worldview:* it is natural for a person to not known or fully understand the ideas of another individual, that is why part of the questions should be oriented to know more about the details that make you see the world the way you do. These aspects include group identity, individual identity or self-concept, values, beliefs, and language.\n* *Non-judgmental:* as presented on the Counselling in Northumberland website \u201cusually described as unconditional positive regard. UPR means being willing to suspend your beliefs and values, not in an inauthentic way, but in a way which sees the world through the clients\u2019 eyes\u201d.\n* *Suggestions, no impositions:* guiding the patient to get their thoughts, behaviors, and feelings in order, no miraculous advice or orders. \n* *Flexibility:* the course of the therapy has to be modified according to the needs of the person and not encased in a mold for everyone, \n* *Trust:* alliance, feeling comfortable with the dynamic and the person, must \n* *Boundaries:* both the patient and therapist have to be aware of the difference between a professional and a friendship relationship to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nKnowing this makes it easier to identify conflictive situations and when to stop a dynamic that is being unhealthy by violating any of these points. \n\n**The profile of the modern woman shoved down our throats** \n\nPeople don\u2019t like to admit this, but the paths taken by societies always lead to \u201cstandardization\u201d to say it somehow, it makes things easier, if we all thought the same way no problems would occur, sadly (and luckily for our sanity) this is impossible, but the formation of groups and subgroups is the closest thing we have, that is why when the majority behaves in a certain way, the tendency is to feel peer pressure until you fall into the same trend and mindset. This is how we imitate the actions and patterns of others, getting married at a certain age, having certain aspirations, and the idea of what being successful means; but not only that, people who are role models or who seem trustworthy in a very personal level have more influence than peers for people, especially when they are going through a vulnerable phase, take for example teachers and in this case, therapists. \n\nBeing aware of this standardization will help you understand what profile people expect you to have and how to avoid falling into that if you don\u2019t want to do it. \n\n**Apparently, the traditional family and female roles are the worst that can happen to a person, and modern psychologists are not afraid to save us all**\n\n\u201cAn important point of difference between the traditional and modern families relates to the position of women. Formerly, the women occupied a very low position in the family. They were just slaves to men possessing none of their own individuality. They had no rights nor any freedom\u201d This is the description given by the website Psychology Discussion of the difference between a traditional family and a modern family. \n\nOne of the most influential female psychologists of the 20th century, Betty Friedan, says that \u201cwomen who \u2018adjust\u2019 as housewives, who grow up wanting to be \u2018just a housewife,\u2019 are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camps\u2026 they are suffering a slow death of mind and spirit.\u201d\n\nAccording to the APA, 74% of US career psychologists are women and 61% of American women identify themselves as feminists, I\u2019m sure that a great percentage of the psychologists see themselves as such.\n\nDuring an interview representing the APA, Debra Kawahara, Ph.D., an assistant psychology professor at the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University and chair of the Div. 35 Task Force on Making Feminism Relevant.  answered the question \u201cHow does feminism apply in psychology today?\u201d saying \u201cProfessionally, it matters beyond just how it affects psychologists. Each person needs to think about how they, in their own way, would seek social justice for things like prejudice and inequality in the workplace and careers for women. It's changing things so the obstacles aren't there for our clients-making a difference in the daily lives of all people.\u201d \n\nWe are not talking about just \u201cfeminist psychology\u201d anymore and I am not saying that only psychologists share these points of view, but these are the people you disclose all your sorrows and concerns to and the people who are supposed to be there to help you find a solution to your problems, fully supported by the APA, and they even have a division for it. \n\n**Is it inevitable for therapists to force their points of view into our lives?** \n\nLike psychologist Cindy Trawinski says \u201cNo one is immune from bias, not even us therapists! Everyone has bias\u201d The difference is when the individual is able to separate their personal thoughts from a professional context and act accordingly or decide to not continue with the sessions if this bias is too difficult to handle and set aside. \n\nTraining and education make psychotherapists able to separate their beliefs from their work, and there is plenty of capable professionals who can provide mental health attention to all kinds of people. \n\nAnd yet again, is not about forcing, on our end, the red pill into the APA system or into any psychotherapist, that would be equally wrong, but there should be a consequence for those psychologists who, in any way, directly or indirectly try to indoctrinate their patients otherwise this discipline will be completely corrupted and destroyed sooner or later.  \n\n**Conclusion (abstract)**\n\nThe extreme popularization of feminism has gotten into the minds of the mental health sector, some people find it difficult to separate their beliefs from the therapy sessions, and some others, like many members of the APA purposely try to convert all females to feminism, encouraging vulnerable patients to not engage in long-term relationships at a young age and follow certain \u201cempowering\u201d behaviors that aren\u2019t part of the original worldview of the subject. Being aware of all this will make you choose a therapist wisely if you need one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to read all the interviews, articles and definitions I talked about [check the references out.](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XR0JQlfxdY3yAiJKT0fNabTNKET6N4RRoxNhkQgBumY\/edit?usp=sharing)","title":"Dangers of clinical psychology infected by feminism: the profile of the modern woman forced into the minds of patients","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/q5wi7e\/dangers_of_clinical_psychology_infected_by\/"}

By the time most relationships come to an end, one partner is usually more resentful than the other. A common reason people who cheat give is that they were getting something their partner wasn\u2019t able to offer to them(Notice the underlying entitlement).\n\nPeople don\u2019t get resentful over night, it is usually a process that begins when one person feels that their actions or well being is not being valued. Resent builds up when a series of actions that trigger negative emotions are repeated often. In some occasions resent morphs into despising and being aggressive. And most often it can be avoided. Unmet conditions or poorly executed actions trigger unhappiness which in turn triggers resent. As this goes on, it begins building up a wall of anger and animosity.  \n\nOne of the most common mistakes people make in relationships is assuming that their partner understands what they are going through or what they should be doing in the relationship. And as most of them realize the more the partner doesn\u2019t do what they think they ought to do, the more resentful they get towards them.  \n\nSometimes people get mad at their partners for not bringing what they they think they should bring and forget to appreciate what they bring. When feeling resentful it\u2019s useful to figure out the cause and in a calm manner address it to your partner. It\u2019s only after communicating your true feelings in a respectable manner can you be able to make a well thought out decision.  \n\nA common advice has always been to avoid going to bed angry. Learn to talk out issues as soon as possible before they pile up and become a monster with which most people find it hard to even identify why they hate their partners. Resent spreads. It becomes easy to despise and be hostile towards something we harbor negative feelings towards. An example is how people grow to hate even the way their partners laugh. Its is in this state that people are vulnerable to make rash decisions like cheating, being passive aggressive or purposely hurting their partners thinking that they are teaching them a lesson when most of the time they don\u2019t know what is going on.  \n\nNever assume your partner reads and understands the situation. Sometimes people are oblivious to the obvious things. Calmly be honest with your partner how the situation is making you feel and what you expect and you might avoid a small situation getting out of hand.","title":"Dealing with Resentment: Don't Let it Grow.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ksf7v1\/dealing_with_resentment_dont_let_it_grow\/"}

The reason I call him alpha male is because he is the whole package. He is very direct, he is financially well off, he is god fearing, he treats me like a queen, he takes care of his responsibilities without being told to. He is caring, loving, assertive, articulate, funny, analytical, intelligent, and thoughtful. He is a provider, a teacher, and a good friend. \n\nI, on the other hand, struggle to communicate with him. I cut him off often, I say things That I don\u2019t mean. I curse. I raise my voice. I complain and don\u2019t solve my problems. I tell him what to do. I don\u2019t listen to him and do what he says. I talk in circles. I don\u2019t say what I mean. I can be selfish and arrogant and I don\u2019t take well to his constructive criticisms. I get upset when he tries to correct me because I feel like I\u2019m always wrong. I always get defensive when he speaks to me and I often try to prove him wrong (when he is ALWAYS right). Not only that, but I engage in negative self talk all the time. I have low self esteem, especially since being with him. I feel like I\u2019m not good enough or at his level. \n\nHowever, I also cook for him everyday. I ask him what he needs throughout the day. I give him foot and back massages everyday. I help him get ready for work by getting his clothes together and making him coffee. I can be affectionate and he says I\u2019m funny all the time. Yet, I have those other negative aspects of myself that is slowly pushing him away. He says that I don\u2019t talk about children and therefore he thinks I just don\u2019t want any with him.  He says I self sabotage every good thing, especially a good relationship with a good man. \nI was pregnant in the beginning of this year but I lost it so that was hard and during that time, our relationship was on the rocks. \n\nWe argue often. So much so, that events and invitations are then cancelled and we end up not doing anything. \n\nMy husband talks to me about how feminism has destroyed women and that I\u2019m going down that same path. He puts videos of mgtow men talking about how they don\u2019t want to deal with women because of how selfish, lazy, and unappreciative they are in relationships. My husband has plans for our future and I\u2019m ruining it day by day. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be a feminist of this day an age I want to be a traditional wife who takes care of her husband and puts him first. Not to mention, my husband is 9 years older than me so he has more wisdom than I do. \nI need help. I need to be more humble. I need more clarity. I want to be a strong woman and yet provide peace and be submissive to my husband. \n\nAny feedback is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nTLDR: I am struggling to be a good wife to my alpha male husband. There are certain characteristics I need to possess in order to fully take care of him physically, emotionally, and mentally. I haven\u2019t acted mature enough and haven\u2019t developed the emotional intelligence to humble myself and do what I need to do for him. The more we fight, the more I realize how much of a feminist I can be, and I want to get rid of that mindset. If I don\u2019t, I will end up losing the best thing I have.","title":"How to be a wife to an alpha male","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ijgcdv\/how_to_be_a_wife_to_an_alpha_male\/"}

He had never realized that I was expressing my opinions when we had disagreements. I had the tendency of saying things like \u201cWhy not ____?\u201d and trying to convince him. I never said I wanted something, but rather tried to reason with him. So of course, in those situations, he would do what he thought was best because he thought I was just offering other points. \n\nThis all reminded me of a lesson in the Surrendered Wife about saying I WANT and not trying to reason or nag or convince your partner of something. Make it clear what you want without offering reasons or trying to cajole, and usually your mate wants you to be happy and will happily acquiescence. When reading the book, I thought it was too demanding for me to ever say, and it felt silly but that kind of clarity makes decisions simple. \n\nAnyway, simple miscommunication with the fianc\u00e9 could have ruined a night for us but thanks to you guys and the Surrendered Wife, it made our relationship even closer ","title":"Update: A lesson from the Surrendered Wife","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8no0p3\/update_a_lesson_from_the_surrendered_wife\/"}

This means having some understanding of what men want in a partner, and in particular, what your man wants in a partner, and then using that information to become the best version of yourself you can be. For this reason, self-improvement and self-awareness are fundamental components of RPW.\n\nThis is the first axiom on the list and that is because at its heart, all of RP is about self-awareness and self-improvement. An unstated corollary is this: \n\n**You can only change yourself**\n\nThis has been an idea that has been missing in some recent posts. \n\nFirst and foremost, you cannot ask for advice on behalf of others. We cannot advise you how to convert your sister, mother, best friend, girlfriend, aunt, niece or second cousin twice-removed to an RPW mindset. No matter how close you are to a woman, you cannot know what is going on in her mind or her relationship. It is a waste of time to try to change someone who is unwilling. We are an open forum, you can send these women to us and we will welcome and advise them, but we will no longer allow posts on someone else\u2019s behalf. \n\nThe second area that this concept needs to be applied is from women asking advice on how to fix their SO. \n\nThere are strategies that *you* can employ to change your own behavior with the intention of altering the dynamics in a relationship. We can offer advice on how to communicate with your SO better, to encourage him to accomplish his goals, to get out of the way so that he can lead or to be the best partner you can be. \n\nWhat we cannot do is tell you how to change him. Remember, you can only change yourself. \n\nIf you are approaching a question with the attitude of changing him, we will try to advise you on changing yourself. If we think a situation is hopeless, we will advise you on how to best move on. If you don\u2019t understand his behavior, we can explain men to you.  If you argue that you\u2019ve done no wrong, there is no advice we can give. If you ask: *why isn\u2019t he different*, we will tell you why, but we cannot tell you how to make him be different. \n\nThe mod team will take more care with these sort of posts. We encourage the community to help women reflect on the fact that change originates with her. However, if it becomes clear that a woman is intent on fixing her man, we will shut down the discussion so we aren\u2019t wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy. \n\nJust as we cannot advise someone on behalf of his sister, we cannot tell you how to tell your SO how to change. \n\nYou are here to make yourself a better woman so that it will spread through your relationship and your life.\n\n\u201cBe the change you want to see in the world\u201d \n\nHappy Posting!\n\nPearl\n\n\n","title":"A Rule Update - \"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8lf7zl\/a_rule_update_everyone_thinks_of_changing_the\/"}

But what exactly is the nature of support? Is it just being \"a cheerleader\"? Until recently, I assumed the brunt of being supportive fell upon this idea -- of a woman reassuring and encouraging, mainly through her words. \n\nRecently I have realized this idea I had is *wrong*. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been repainting, slightly remodelling, and redecorating the kitchen over the past few days. Yesterday evening, we finally got everything done, and while I was making dinner, he cleaned up all the mess we'd made over the past few days. (He had enough time to clean everything because what I was making was quite time-consuming. :P) \n\nOnce dinner was ready and we sat down to eat, he turned to me and thanked me \"for being so supportive. Without you I would have never gotten everything finished today. But seeing you keep working and not give up inspired me to keep going. Otherwise I would have just spend the afternoon playing video games and not finishing anything.\"\n\nNot only was this a really sweet moment, it also led me to rethink my idea of what it really means to be supportive. It isn't just giving encouragement (although that is definitely part of it), it's working just as hard alongside him; sharing the work; picking things up where he starts to lag; and making long, boring, annoying tasks more pleasant.

That's not manners or common sense, that's internalized misogyny!\n\n\nThen there's a discussion of LMR.

It is assumed that those who are reading it are aiming to find long term relationships with men.\"\n\n\nWhich is really the point, isn't it--the author has pretty much misconstrued what RPW is.

I thought today I would share a post as I\u2019ve been really focusing on making improvements in myself following RPW philosophy. Very thankful I\u2019ve found this subreddit! Since I\u2019ve started incorporating the tenets of RPW into my life I\u2019ve noticed my relationship with my boyfriend growing by leaps and bounds. We\u2019ve been together about five years and I\u2019ve never felt more secure and in-love. I can\u2019t speak for him although I have noticed he seems much less stressed these days! He\u2019s a lawyer so his job is naturally high stress\u2026. I think it\u2019s made a difference that he\u2019s had a lovely and calm home to come home to instead of nagging, manipulation or shrewish behavior. \n\n\nAnyway, on to the situation that occurred that lead me to write my first ever post in RPW (and on reddit in general, I suppose?) Apologies if I make any errors, please feel free to let me know if there\u2019s any way I can improve.\n\n\nThis past weekend one of our close friends was having their birthday. My boyfriend mentioned that he would like to throw her a surprise party as her husband just recently had a bit of a health scare and it\u2019s been a tough time for both of them. I love planning parties so of course I jumped at the chance and invited all of our closest friends (mostly couples). \n\n\nOne of the couples that came, the boyfriend is very close to my boyfriend (we\u2019ll call him K) and has been with his girlfriend (we\u2019ll call her A) for about nine years. A can be a lovely person, her and I get along very well\u2026 when she\u2019s sober. Unfortunately she\u2019s quite prone to imbibing too much and there\u2019s been multiple situations where she\u2019s gotten completely wasted. \n\n\nWe chatted for a while as I put the finishing touches on the appies. She seemed in good spirits although she did make multiple complaints about her body and her appearance which was very sad for me to hear as she\u2019s struggled with her body image for quite some time. \n\n\nPeople steadily started showing up and one of my boyfriend\u2019s buddies brought with him a beer pong set. My boyfriend loves playing games so him and his buddies played. At one point, my boyfriend was eager for me to play a round so the birthday girl and I played against my boyfriend and her husband. They let us use the sangria I made instead of beer since we\u2019re not big drinkers and I had made the sangria very low in alcohol content for that exact purpose. It was super fun! We left them to their shenanigans once our game was over and myself and the other ladies headed out onto the patio to chat and sip on sangria. \n\n\nA at this point had been knocking back drinks pretty rapidly and she was starting to get visibly drunk and somewhat belligerent. She mocked me and the birthday girl for playing beer pong with sangria and when the birthday girl laughed and shrugged that seemed to tick her off even more. She called us \u201cp*ssies\u201d and told us she\u2019d \u201cshow [us] how it's done\u201d. I laughed, thinking she was kidding, and went back to the conversation I was having with another girl. Next thing I know I hear the patio door open and close and she\u2019s gone inside.\n\n\nTen minutes later my boyfriend\u2019s cousin comes outside and looks mortified. She says that A is making an absolute spectacle of herself playing beer pong against my boyfriend, it had gotten so bad she couldn\u2019t even watch she was so embarrassed for her. She tells me apparently she\u2019s shaking her breasts at my boyfriend trying to distract him while he takes a shot and she\u2019s twerking in the mirror and that she called K a homophobic slur in front of everyone. I\u2019m stunned and my first urge is to run inside and see what\u2019s going on, for some reason the hamster in my head starts getting angry at my boyfriend?!\n\n\nI took a moment to calm myself down, debated pretending to go inside to grab a bite to eat (even though I\u2019d already eaten, I clearly just wanted a reason to monitor my boyfriend's reactions to her behavior) and decided instead to stay and keep chatting with the ladies. I told my boyfriend\u2019s cousin \u201coh no, how embarrassing for her, let me know if she needs anything\u201d and went back to my conversation. I was fuming mad on the inside but I maintained calm on the outside and eventually my anger dissipated.  \n\n\nLong story short- she wound up vomiting all over the bathroom floor after the birthday cake was served. Being a good hostess I cleaned it up, gave her some old clothes of mine to change into as she\u2019d thrown up on herself quite a bit, cleaned as much of the vomit out of her hair as I could and helped her boyfriend get her into their car. She texted me the next morning to tell me that she didn\u2019t remember anything but that she had been told she was \u201ca bit of a hot mess\u201d. I decided to go the kind route and told her that I hope she doesn\u2019t have too bad of a hangover and I thanked her for attending. \n\n\nMy boyfriend saw the text and commented on what a disaster she was and how embarrassed he was for her and how everybody was mortified watching her antics. We talked about it for a while and he said he might say something to her boyfriend as he doesn't understand how he can be with someone who was such a public embarrassment. Then he thanked me for throwing such a wonderful party and said he had a great time!!! I was beaming like an idiot. \n\n\nMission accomplished!\n\nMoral of the story: Trust your man. ACTUALLY trust him. Don\u2019t check up on him to make sure he\u2019s \u201cbehaving\u201d and don\u2019t do so \u201csubtly\u201d. Whether or not he notices you\u2019re checking up on him, that kind of behavior just feeds the hamster and reinforces those thoughts in your head. \n\nPS- I\u2019m open to any critiques about how I handled that! If any of you ladies have any suggestions I\u2019d love to hear them. Not sure if I should have intervened when she was super drunk or if that would have just made me a target for belligerent drunken behavior.

It makes sense to make your vetting process as thoughtful, thorough, and efficient as possible.  Your *role* while dating is to appear as an appealing and worthwhile potential partner obviously, but don't neglect to pay critical attention to the emerging details of his persona as you work to project your own best image.\n\n## Nonverbal vetting\n\nFor the most part, your vetting is passive and observational.  Confrontationally overt tests, specifically [shit tests](https:\/\/illimitablemen.com\/2014\/12\/14\/the-shit-test-encyclopedia\/), are unfeminine and RPW specifically recommends against them.  \n\nKnowledge of [kinesics (body language)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Body_language) and nonverbal communication gives you a great edge in the dating game.  Even from a distance, you can tell a lot about a person by watching their eye contact and posture relative to others.  Knowing the signs to look for and how to interpret them is well-studied but not widely known; like assertiveness, it's almost an orphan life skill that goes untaught.  \n\nOne fascinating book on the subject (not dating specifically) is *What every body is saying,* written by a former FBI profiler\/interrogator.  Be aware that body language has a strong learned component; the \"rules\" governing eye contact, posture, etc can be quite different according to culture\/upbringing, social class, and situational context.  This makes it easy for the unaware or lay person to misinterpret body language signals in newly-met people, but the good news is, just a few hours of study will give you a great framework to help understand the complexity of it better than most humans.\n\nIf you take away one lesson about kinesics, let it be this: **If there is a conflict between what someone is saying (\"Yes\") and what their body language is saying (shaking head *NO*), the body language is almost always correct.**\n\n## Some signs you can use to probe and vet a prospect observationally\n\nHow he treats people \"beneath\" him such as waitstaff is a classic indicator of character; you also need to observe how he interacts with equals and authority figures. How does he speak of his colleagues, his siblings\/cousins; his bosses, his elders, the law, etc?\n\nHow socially adept is he? Is he good at reading nonverbal cues? Can he guide the interaction to a state of push-pull with you? Can he banter well with people you encounter? If a pretty woman walks by, is he discreet about looking while in front of you, or does he stare like a 5yo when the dessert cart goes by?\n\nHow respectful and genuine is he toward *you?*  Does his escalation respect boundaries and respond to cues from you?  Is he engaged, relaxed, and spontaneous, or does he seem to be reciting lines and acting formulaic, then becoming frustrated if things go \"off script?\"\n\nHow does he deal with delays, frustrations, problems? Is he quick to anger, does he hold a grudge; or does he pivot and accomodate unexpected glitches for the overall good of the day's experience? \n\n**Example:** If a table won't be available for another 10 minutes, does he spend that time arguing with the hostess and ranting and fuming over it, or does he spend it sitting with his date chatting and getting to know her?\n\nWhat is his sense of humor like? Self-aware, LOL at our human foibles type?  Philosophical, wry irony or karmic justice?  Blaming or demeaning, where one party is always hurt, shamed, or loses face?  The things a person finds funny can reveal a *lot.*\n\nHow well does he take charge, when minor or major opportunities for leadership arise? What leadership styles does he use in various contexts; authoritarian and demanding, or charismatic and pragmatic? \n\n**Example:** Spontaneously organizing a random queue into an orderly line, or recruiting strangers to help move something heavy like a stalled car in the parking lot aisle or a fallen tree branch across a busy path; versus doing nothing and being stuck in the problem like everyone else.\n\nHow is his overall integrity? If he makes a mistake, does he make amends, deny, cover up, or deflect blame? Do inconsistencies or lies come to light when adding up everything he says?\n____\n\n## Verbal vetting\n\nGiven the time constraints of getting to know a person well before becoming intimate, one cannot passively wait for every necessary detail to emerge spontaneously from a prospect's behavior and words.  It is necessary to verbally probe for information you need that is not forthcoming on its own; be careful but not inhibited over the thought of actively learning about your prospect becoming manipulative of you.\n\nYou definitely want to avoid an interrogation or job interview vibe; you'll get the most accurate impression about a prospect organically through subtly guided conversation.   Instead of peppering him with questions, use mutual self-disclosure to maintain a balance of knowledge about each other.  Aim for a physical and social environment where your prospect can engage you without distractions like loud music, things on the table before you etc.  .You want to appear warm and inviting in your conversation, to set the stage for him to feel comfortable about opening up and revealing his inner self to you.\n\n**Example:** \"Do you want to get married any time soon? Are you the marrying type?\" is rather direct and blunt, therefore potentially off-putting.  To obtain the same information, you might say in conversation, \"My parents are still together after 35 years; I hope to be happily married like that one day.\" Then STFU and let him respond. If he changes the subject, that's one whole block of information. If he's interested in marriage and you, TRUST ME, he will lead the discussion in that direction at the appropriate time and pace.\n\nHow well does he reciprocate your interest in him overall? Is he vague or secretive about his time away from you, his future, your future? How responsive is he to your needs, and concerns you bring up to him? Is he overly concerned and supplicating, does he ignore them completely, or does he try to strike a healthy balance?  Does he show responsive leadership and initiative as a date progresses, does he do what he wants regardless of how his partner reacts, or does he defer to YOU for ideas and feedback every tiny step of the way?\n\nHow future-oriented is he in general? Example: Talks mainly about parties, conversations, events of the day, what he'd like to do to you later that day and other ephemera; versus career, pertinent news\/current events, family history and plans for the future relevant to a long-term partner. A favorite expression comes to mind: Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.\n\n**When he isn't revealing vital information spontaneously, don't be afraid to subtly elicit the information from him verbally.  Mutual self-disclosure is the best tool for this.**\n\nIn [Part 3,](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4yrobj\/vetting_a_man_part_3_alpha_and_beta_traits\/) we will focus on Alpha and Beta traits and their importance to the vetting process.\n","title":"Vetting a Man Part 2: Observational and verbal vetting","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4yrqed\/vetting_a_man_part_2_observational_and_verbal\/"}

I\u2019ve been MIA for a while, super busy and just generally unable to sit down and type anything.

The problem is that there are always multiple reasons to not do what he says:  you think he actually wants something else, someone else wants something different, your own judgment\u2026 and on and on it spins.  There\u2019s a point where you should just stop thinking about that stuff and do what he freaking says.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying to just blindly follow orders.  Voice your concerns if you must, but in the end, please please please do what he says.  And if you really can\u2019t do what he says because it\u2019s horrifyingly against your morals or something, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be with that man.\n\nDoes he want you to wear that dress to dinner?  Wear it.  It doesn\u2019t matter if you had something else in mind.  If it doesn\u2019t match the weather, make it work \u2013 add a jacket or different shoes than you usually would wear.  He wants to see you in that dress \u2013 be his fantasy.\n\nDoes he want you to keep something secret?  Keep your mouth shut.  Will telling someone make you feel good?  Maybe.  Will it piss him off?  Definitely.  Take the definite.\n\nDoes he like your makeup a certain way?  Even if you think you look better a different way, who are you trying to attract?  Him.  So do it how he likes it.\n\nDoes he want you to stay away from a certain place\/person?  Don\u2019t go there.  He probably has a good reason.  \n\nDid someone ask you to do something that goes against something he asked?  Don\u2019t even try to compromise between the two, just say no.\n\nThere are so many ways to go wrong with this.  For example, my SO asked me to keep something secret.  A while later, I was hanging out with a friend.  She was in a situation that the secret was relevant to, and she was feeling pretty crappy about it, so I told her.  She felt so relieved, which was great!  But then my SO found out and he was pissed beyond belief.  In a moment of pity, I picked my friend over my SO.  If I just did what he said, she would have gotten over it and he would not be pissed off.  You can\u2019t please everyone, so pick your SO.\n\nYou can also go very right with this.  I am in the middle of planning our wedding and my SO has a very specific request.  My entire family wants me to do this one thing differently.  I am indifferent to the way it\u2019s done, and they both have good reasons to do it the way they want.  I was getting pressure from my family for months, until one day I started to argue with my mother over the phone and just flat out told her, \u201cI can\u2019t please everyone, so if I\u2019m going to choose a side, I\u2019m choosing my husband.\u201d  After that, all nagging stopped.\n\ntl;dr Do what he says and you\u2019ll avoid a lot of grief.","title":"Do what he says.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4cbcsl\/do_what_he_says\/"}

It's about making people feel a certain way when they're around you: exuding a soft, approachable, loving energy that will make people feel comfortable and happy when they're with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Posture, movement, and body language: This tends to get thrown into the \"looks\" category, but I don't think that's entirely accurate. There is a lot of positivity that comes with standing up straight with your shoulders back. There is also an energy that comes from choosing to look *up* (which creates a feeling of authority for who you are looking at) or *down* (creates the feeling of submission) at someone, rather than *at* them (which is very casual). Positioning of your body, your head, your hands, your legs... it all gives off a certain vibe. I suggest watching women you want to emulate, and noticing the way they move, they way they sit, the way they look at people. It's all very intentional.\n2. A soft gaze: As they say, the eyes are the window into the soul. If you're running around scowling at everyone, making the angry eyes, you're gonna give off a very intimidating energy. If you have Resting Unhappy Face (like me), I really suggest watching [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AY4NWmcEZWk) to help with that. Looking at others with softness and friendliness will attract them to you.\n3. Move slowly: Stop being in a hurry if you don't need to be.  It's a hectic, demanding energy. Instead, consciously slow down. Walk slowly, speak slowly, eat slowly, etc. Obviously not to an extreme degree, but enough that you can \"smell the roses\". This instantly relaxes people,  signaling that you enjoy being with them and that you're savoring the time together.\n4. Smile: At the waiter, the person who cut you off in the grocery store, at your husband when he comes home. Smile at everyone, especially when it's hard to do. It really softens people to you, and it will help you a lot. The person who cut you off will be more likely to say sorry, the waiter will be more likely to help you if you have a problem, and your husband will be more happy to see you when he comes home. A simple smile will get you a lot further than you think it will.\n5. Speak with grace: Be responsible with what you're saying, and how you say it, because it is the key to a soft touch. For example: you want your husband to fix a broken sink for you. Rather than bluntly going up to him and saying \"Hey, I need you to fix this sink this week\" you could come to him with a smile and say \"Hey, when you find some time this week, would you mind fixing the sink for me please?\" It's very easy to fall into blunt, direct speech with the men in our lives, because that is often how they speak, but it's not how we speak. Ask rather than demand, employ a soft touch, speak with a smile, and be understanding when the answer is no.\n6. Do not let your emotions control you: Piggybacking off of the last point, you need to be able to control yourself when things are hard. You will inevitably get into conflict, and you need to know how to handle it with maturity. Nothing else on this list matters if when you're upset, you melt into a hysterical mess. This does not mean that you shouldn't feel your emotions or address them, it means that you should know how to do so without hurting others. If you have a problem with someone, calmly tell them that they hurt your feelings, why it hurt your feelings, a proposed solution, and the ability to compromise if your solution does not work. Don't bring up the past, don't call names, don't yell. Maintain control.\n7. Be quick to laughter: Nobody likes the woman who takes herself so seriously that she can't laugh at anything. Life is ridiculous, and if you can't laugh at it you're gonna have a bad time, and so is everyone else around you. Find the humor in a bad situation. I told this story somewhere else recently, but I'll repeat it here because it's poignant: My husband recently got a new grill and promptly set the side of our house on fire. It wasn't a terrible fire and only did cosmetic damage, thankfully. My husband was understandably nervous to tell me about this, and was wildly apologetic about it. I responded by saying that he was meant to grill the food, not the house, and that we would work it out. My husband was beyond relieved that I could laugh about this and let it go. Not everything needs to be taken seriously, especially when you can't do anything to change it. People will be much more likely to come to you in hard situations if you can do that.\n8. Be kind: There is very little genuine kindness left in the world, and when people come across it, they want more of it. This is different than being *nice*. Being nice can include telling a lie to save the feelings of another. That is not kindness. Kindness means doing the right thing, even when it's hard, as well as when it's easy. It means to be genuine. It can be a compliment, or a hard truth. But people will sense that sincerity, and they will flock around you for it. It will also repel people who you don't want in your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of that to say: be the light in the dark. That is the culmination of all of these traits. The world is full of pain, suffering, and darkness. Don't contribute to it. You are the hospital in the battlefield, the place people go to heal and to feel cared for. That is the core of femininity in my eyes. Pretty dresses and clear skin help, but the feminine soul is one of deep caring, respect, and healing. That is what will keep people around long after your skin is wrinkled and your hair is gray.","title":"How to Achieve a Feminine Aura","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/151ms2s\/how_to_achieve_a_feminine_aura\/"}

We ended the night with just the two of us sitting and chatting at a cozy little bar. We were talking about how fast time flies and she told me that she misses when my brother and I were little and how it feels like yesterday we were still in elementary school. This sparked a long discussion about motherhood and raising children and I will relay some of the things that she said that I think was important.\n\n\nShe told me that, for her, being a mother was her top priority. She took us everywhere and always made sure that she was our primary caretaker. We never had a babysitter growing up because she always took us with her wherever she could.\n\nTo her, when you have kids, they take over your life and focus. You have to think about them and make decisions that are in their best interest. Bring a mom becomes your #1 job outside of everything else. Being a wife becomes a close second and you must make sure your husband is aware of how important your kids are to you before they're even born. \n\nEnjoy your kids when they're little and rely on you. They'll grow up to be whoever you raised them to be, so make sure you take your time and savor every moment you have to raise them and spend time with them.\n\nListen to your kids when they're young and they'll talk to you when they're older. No matter what your toddler is rambling about, listen actively and show interest in what they tell you. It encourages them to communicate with you and lets them know that you will always listen.\n\nMake sure your kids know how to behave in public settings. Teach them how to sit still and have manners. You will be able to enjoy taking them out with you and they will not be embarrassed to be in public.\n\nKids need someone to show them how to interact with the world. Be their example and show them how to be polite to others. Watch how you speak around them, because they will mimic your actions and words.\n\nKids can pick up a lot more than your realize. They'll know how you feel about them and it's a parent's job to make sure they know that they're loved and supported. \n\nMy mom went to every sports game and play performance we were in. She said that it was part of her job. It didn't matter how much she didn't want to go, she went to support us as our mom. \n\n\nThis is all the advice and knowledge she had to share. My mom is not perfect by any means, but she is definitely a great mother and I look up to her and how she raised us. I know this may not technically be overly red pill related, but I thought you all might find it interesting. So much of red pill is focused on men and women and relationships that I think that we forget to talk about how kids and family fits in. I thought that this conversation would be good to share here.","title":"A Conversation with My Mother","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/122n3tk\/a_conversation_with_my_mother\/"}

I feel like it's making my boyfriend less interested in me. I'm curious if you guys have any suggestions of feminine hobbies that aren't too \"basic\/empty\" (like shopping), or hobbies that make your man seem to \"light up\" a bit?\n\n(Some background, not necessary to read but in case it provides context;)\n\nLately I've neglected my own life a lot and only focused on school, even though my education doesn't require that much time I put a HUGE amount of pressure on myself. This results in dry conversations with my boyfriend (whom I don't live with). When he asks me what i did today, my response is always to say \"university and nothing really\". It makes the conversation dry out quickly. \n\nI remember when I was less manic about impressing  my professors, I'd have more time to do different things. Just small things like trying a new recipe, going to a cafe, the library. When I would tell my boyfriend that he'd get so happy it almost made my heart hurt a bit. He's told me he really needs a partner who's interested and engaged with life, and curious about the world. I'm not really sure how to implement that in my own life because I easily get complacent with doing nothing except school and watching Netflix. \n\n\nA last, unrelated but somehow related silly anecdote:\nI had a partner once who told me \"this is why I love you\" when I made a blanket fort and decorated it, for myself.

How does a glass of water do that?\"\n\nThe Doctor says: \"The water itself does nothing. It's keeping your mouth shut that does the trick\".\n\n**The STFU Method**\n\nThe STFU Method ^TM is a handy way to create and keep peace in your daily life. More specifically it will enable you to have a more loving relationship with your SO. We would like to examine why, how and when it is applied while also dispelling the misconception that you are a doormat for doing so.\n\n*Why do I need to STFU?*\n\nThe art of listening is an invaluable skill that can be useful in all areas of your life. We listen to friends when they have trouble, kids when they want to show something off, our parents when they have some wisdom to share, and a variety of other times in our lives. How it is applied to your current romantic relationship is detrimental in the success\/failure of it. I\u2019m sure we can all agree that if you don\u2019t listen, you can never fully understand. This is exactly why we stress  on RPW to just STFU. \n\nWhile communicating your wants, needs, and feelings is important, listening is often *more* important in the health and welfare of your relationship. Understanding what is actually going on vs what you feel makes it easier to know what the next step is. Reflexively responding to situations is only good in fight or flight situations. In the beginning of learning how to listen, it is good to just take all the data presented and digest it before actually forming an opinion about it. Over time, you will find that you instinctively can discern the appropriate behaviors for specific situations without ever needing to voice anything. In the beginning however, it is important to just S T F U. Listen. Learn. Absorb. \n\nFor new relationships, it is easy to STFU. You want to know how the person acts, what they think, what they like, and you want to please them. This is great and wonderful. The trick is when you have been in a relationship and the honeymoon phase is over, how do you keep that ability to listen and desire to please going? You see this guy at his worst and you are expected to still take him seriously? *GASPS* Seriously though, complacency is the killer of romance. So how do you prevent this? By listening to your partner. When you listen to your partner you are actively working on your relationship. You cannot expect a relationship to survive with minimal effort on your part. It just won\u2019t happen. \n\n*How do I STFU*\n\nThis might seem like a no-brainer. Just close your mouth and all will be well. It can be a little bit trickier than that. STFU also means body language. Eye rolling is not you STFU\u2019ing. Gasping with exasperations is you not STFU\u2019ing. Pouting is you not STFU\u2019ing. \n\nSTFU is you actively and consciously removing yourself from a situation to better assess it. For those who are more practiced, it could very well be only keeping your mouth closed. However, for most of us self proclaimed strong willed bull headed women we may have to *smile* and *say \u201cok my love\u201d* and **walk away**. These three small actions can make a big difference in your communication style. \n\nThe first step I suggest is to smile. This is probably the hardest step because you want to rip someones head off when they say something you don\u2019t like but the more you do this the easier it\u2019ll become. Fake it til you make it! The first few times, your SO might look at you like *WTF is wrong with her?* but over time it\u2019ll just be a positive way to signal that you need some time to process the interaction you just had. You could give mean stank face but what is that going to accomplish? Who does that really hurt? You because you\u2019re the one going to be stuck with the wrinkles. LOL. So smile and breathe in.\n\nNext is to state something agreeable. \u201cYes, my love\u201d or \u201cok, honey\u201d both give a positive affirmation and also reminds your SO that you love them with a term of endearment. You acquiesce to the situation and you do so graciously. This is to preserve intimacy and the closeness of the relationship. When has being a bitch ever gotten you anywhere? Never!\n\nMost important step here. Walk away. Go do what was told to you or just go to the other room. You can let your hamster tire out away from your SO. **DO NOT GO BACK UNTIL YOUR HAMSTER IS PANTING IN THE CORNER ALMOST DEAD FROM RACING AROUND.** Take this time to process what just happened. What was said, how was it said, what did you feel, why did you feel that way, what was your SO trying to say. All of these things are your hamster at work. You can use this as an exercise in reigning it in and over time you should be doing this faster and faster. This is also the time when you realize if you ACTUALLY do have something to say to your SO. This is when you can actually tell whether you should bring up something because it was detrimental on his part to the relationship. However, if that is the case, you still want to do it with a calm, cool and relaxed demeanor so taking time away is always a good idea. \n\nThose are just my three steps. Most times, I just need to close my eyes and take a deep breath and can handle most situations. However, these three steps have always been fundamental in my growth. When a breathe isn\u2019t enough, I walk away. If you find that you are walking away alllll the time, then there may be deeper issues with yourself at hand and those should be examined too. \n\n*When do I STFU*\n\nWhile reading this, you may think that STFU only applies when your SO says something to you that hurts your feelings. However, this applies to a variety of feelings. Not just hurt ones. When you aren\u2019t getting your way, when you think you know better, when you want to control things, when you want to dominate things, when you want something done in a certain way, when you want something done now, when you don\u2019t want to do something now, when you want to hamster, when you don\u2019t want to have sex, when you feel bossed around, when things just aren\u2019t getting done and you want them done NOW!!!! Etc etc etc. \n\nBossing, nagging, whining, bitching, complaining, griping, mothering, smothering, gumbling, belly-aching are alllllll times when you need to STFU. At times these things can be masked as coming from a good place. A gentle reminder every 10 minutes to take out the trash. A little push in the right direction because he has no clue what he is doing. A honey-do list a mile long. Sound familiar? \n\nNow go and STFU!","title":"Back to Basics September - STFU","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pwrd5m\/back_to_basics_september_stfu\/"}

We were nervous and my parents even more so but the moment we met, I never felt more sure about anything. During our visit he gave me a promise ring and said it would be upgraded soon. \n\nI then flew back with him, to Canada, and stayed with his family for 4 months.

This week, I saw another unexpected improvement in my love life!\n\nThere's this guy I had a crush on last year who I decided was definitely not interested in me. Fast forward to this year, and I run into him again, this time acting way more receptive, making eye contact, being more flirty. He texts me that night saying we should meet up at a cafe sometime to catch up.\n\nOur hang out went great. The conversation flowed, we both had moments of IOIs, and we're seeing each other again soon. This is a short FR, but another testament to how much RPW has helped me. This was the guy I thought was miles out of my league both looks-wise and achievement-wise, and yet just by improving myself and my outlook, he actually seems pretty interested in me!\n\nLet me note that to the naked eye, my physical appearance barely improved. I was always an XS without working out, I always dressed girly, and I always had good hygiene. Still, 0 men wanted me before RPW and I was lonely. During my 3 months of monk mode, I focused on what I love doing (cooking and music), instead of feeling ashamed that cooking is \"succumbing to the patriarchy,\" which is what I thought when I was blue-pilled. I started working out 4-5 times a week. I didn't really have fat to burn or anything, but what did change was that I felt so much healthier. I woke up feeling so much readier for the day. It made me much more positive and friendly, which is ultimately the only thing that changed upon first impression. A lot of ladies who are unsuccessful in love, like me 3 months ago, assume that it is because you're not enough appearance-wise. That pain eats at you and makes you into a bitter person. That bitterness is what repels men away a lot of the time, not your looks.\n\nDrop the bitterness and consider what aspects of your personality and your daily habits could be improved. Embrace your feminine nature instead of working against it. Work to become the woman that your ideal man would want, and you will see the changes in the results even if you don't see anything different in the mirror!","title":"Your Outlook on Life Matters!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/9c6nc8\/your_outlook_on_life_matters\/"}

This week we're focusing on tactical strategies on implementing girl game in order to make men fall in love with you or making your man fall harder in love.\n\nPlease note, we are not the original authors of these posts. We'll be offering our insights as both moderators and active community members. Our objective is to provide you with a curated guide that can serve as a cornerstone to understanding RPW principles, while revitalizing some enduring ideas.\n\nToday's post is nominated by \/u\/jenneapolis \n and is an **external but classic post** from the old [Ian Ironwood blog \\(Girl Game: The GFE\\)](https:\/\/theredpillroom.blogspot.com\/2012\/07\/girl-game-gfe.html) **(warning: the blog link has risque NSFW old illustrated pin ups)** that will occasionally float around RPW and is in our wiki. \n\nIt. Is. Phenomenal. And beautifully brings out the difference between **transactional sex (aka duty sex)** and **validation sex** and how to implement this in your girl game.\n\nA brief quote from an old blog:\n\n> **I would build the entire foundation on understanding this aspect of male sexuality** (if I was to teach red pill to women). Transactional sex is FAR less psychologically enriching for the male and is FAR more vulnerable to dis-intermediation (infidelity) and substitution (porn) than is validation sex.\n\n> **...validation sex is a superfood for the male brain.**\n\n---\n\nIt's not often that I write about \"girl Game\", and it doesn't come up a lot in marriage blogs.  But every now and then I'll explain something in private to one of my readers and it occurs to me that perhaps others might like the same cosmic wisdom about their relationships.\n\n**So prepare for me to lay some Cosmic Wisdom on you, Ladies:**\n\nI know a few whores.  Not a *lot*, but a few -- there were four brothels represented at last year's AVN show, and the ladies like to talk shop as much as any professional woman.  Mrs. Ironwood found them fascinating (she trusts me, but not so much that she's going to let me go to a porn convention in Vegas without her.  Thank Aphrodite!)  In any case, these aren't just Professional women, they're professional *Women*.  They have sex for a living.  Often with other women's husbands.\n\nNow, I've never patronized a prostitute myself, but I have a lot of respect for those who treat it as a vocation, not a mere meal ticket.  (If you haven't seen Firefly, and understood what a Companion is, then you might not understand the distinction.)  But the bread-and-butter for these ladies of the evening is the GFE: The Girl Friend Experience.\n\nWhen a dude gets caught going to a whore, it's usually for the GFE, at least at first.  Most wives could care less just why he was paying for sex, or what kind of sex, or anything else but the name of a good divorce attorney.  That's quite understandable -- and often those questions do come to mind, months afterwards, as both parties are trying to pick up the shards of their lives and figure out where they went wrong.  For the dudes who turned to a pro, it's often the GFE that lures them in.  And it would be instructive for some wives to understand just what the GFE is, and why it has such a potent attraction.  And, perhaps, how you can put that into context of your own sex life.\n\nThe Girl Friend Experience is just that: where a man pays a prostitute to act and behave the same way a new girlfriend does in the early-and-horny stage of infatuation.  After the financial arrangement has been satisfied, then for the duration of the appointment the professional showers the client with physical affection -- hugging, kissing, holding hands, praising him, asking him about himself, and acting utterly fascinated by everything that falls out of their client's mouths -- no matter how banal.  She is not just selling her body, here, she's selling her sexual interest in him.\n\nThe core of the GFE is the sex act, of course -- but often this is limited to a long blowjob or even a lengthy handjob.  Sometimes there's penetrative sex later in an appointment, but the highlight of the experience is the way the woman leads her temporary boyfriend over to the couch, undresses him, and then crawls between his legs for an extended period of pure and unadulterated penis worship.\n\nNow, this is the part that freaks some wives out: why would a dude pay up to $300 for a handjob, something he could ostensibly do himself, or even get at home?  Or shit, even a blowjob?  For $300 a woman would expect a full day at the spa, lunch AND sex, not an intense 90 minute session in a sleazy hotel room.\n\nWhat they don't understand is that the draw is not the orgasm . . . it's the acceptance and emotional affirmation provided on the way to the orgasm.\n\nA good GFE is't just a blowjob, it's all the bells and whistles leading up to it.  It's about the attention.  The attitude. The admiration.  The interest.  The respect.  And the desire to want to please you.  All of those things are part-and-parcel of the infatuation stage of a relationship as it culminates with sex.  It shocks these poor wives to learn that their husbands were paying good money for stuff they didn't really mind doing at home -- *and they can't understand why.*\n\nSo why does a man crave this bit of intimacy -- even with a stranger -- so badly he will sometimes risk everything to enjoy it?  You can blame pure lust, but that misses the mark.  What the client is seeking here is acceptance.  **The fact that a woman is willing to tend to his sexual needs in a way that flatters his masculinity and sense of self so much that many men experience an unadulterated surge of Alpha testosterone.**  It's no secret why \"sudden renewed interest in sex\" is often listed as a sign your husband might be having an affair: a good GFE is like Popeye eating a can of spinach.  You feel like someone really thinks you're worth a damn, even if you had to pay her to think it.  And if that gives a dude enough juice to go home and royally take his wife to Pound Town, then if nothing else you can ascertain that something important happened during his GFE, something sexually and psychologically empowering.\n\nI'm not arguing for married men to seek out whores to fulfill their sense of masculinity.  Quite the contrary.  I'm trying to explain to wives just why a man might consider doing such a thing when he has a loving, sexually permissive wife at home.  And how wives might use the GFE as part of their own sexual repertoire.\n\nFirst, consider your husband's position:\n\nOnce upon a time, he met a really cute girl (you), who for whatever reason laughed at his jokes and made eyes at him and then unexpectedly did that thing in that place and it blew his freaking mind enough so he didn't hesitate to call you.  After that, he was in a dopamine-soaked haze, dripping with testosterone and starlight whenever the image of your face came to mind.  You might remember it differently, but likely he thought the first sex (or maybe the third -- sometimes it takes a few to find the memorable one) you had together was AMAZING, so amazing he started considering what it would be like to spend the rest of his life with that naughty vixen.\n\nSure, he was in the throes of infatuation -- likely you were too.  But while *you* were picking out names for your future children, *he* was picking out colors for future slutty underwear and crazy places you could get away with \"doing it\".  Even if he was thinking about you as his future wife, that was only after a long and torrid period as his hot, sexy, adventurous girlfriend.  The kind of girl that inspires a dude to get in fights with bikers or take cross-country to see the world or consider shaving his pubes.  At the basis of that attitude was sex -- a very specific kind of sex -- the kind of sex that changes a man's life.  Sex with *you*. \n\nHis *girlfriend*.\n\nFast forward, ten years, post-wedding: your husband now has a Wife.  He's married.  And even if he's relatively happily married, a part of him will always long for and lust for his hot, sexy girlfriend.\n\nFrom a female perspective it's easy to see why being a man's wife means so much more than being a mere girlfriend.  Being a Wife is a lifelong (hopefully) commitment.  Being a Wife means more than being a girlfriend -- would your girlfriend know your Social Security number?  Your issues with your mother?  How you can't handle spicy foods?  Of course not -- she just thought you were a bad boy with a big dick who knew how to use it, and that was sufficient.  From a female perspective, being a Wife is a huge, huge responsibility, with sex being just one of many important facets to cover.\n\nSure, it might not be as frequent as it was -- but hell, you aren't 19 anymore, are you?  (Either is he).  And how could it be that frequent with all you have to do?  Especially with jobs and kids?  It's amazing you're in the mood at all, and then the stars have to line up for it to happen.  And when it does happen, it's good, solid responsible married-people sex, two positions max, no oral, see you in a fortnight.  The kind Husbands and Wives have.  Sure, it's nice when it happens, but the way he mopes around about it, and then gets frustrated, well, you're his Wife, not his damn sex slave.  He can just wait.  *What kind of woman does he think you are, anyway?*\n\n(His *girlfriend*.)\n\nYou see, your husband never stopped thinking about you as his girlfriend, first and foremost.  Long after trading in your engagement ring for a wedding band, he still thought about you as \"my girlfriend I'm going to marry\" in his subconscious.  Even after he walked down the aisle and had hot crazy monkey sex on his honeymoon, he was seeing it as the culmination of the Girl Friend Experience, not its death throes.\n\nAnd that's what a lot of wives don't understand.  Your husband does want to have sex, and he does want to have sex with you, and yes, he wants it to be an intimate, deep, emotional, soul-fulfilling experience.  Sometimes.  That's the kind of sex that keeps your marriage stable, reminds you of why you put up with each others' shit, and makes you appreciate the wonders of marital sex.\n\nBut then there's the deep, burning desire within the heart of every man to have the GFE . . . often an experience that wives feel they have grown beyond with maturity and matrimony.  He knows how you feel about him, after all -- you married him, didn't you?  You still fuck him, don't you?  What's the problem?  Why can't he be satisfied with what you have to offer?\n\nBecause you're offering him the opportunity to make love with his Wife.  And sometimes a dude just needs his girlfriend to tell him how wonderful he is, suck his dick, and then leave him alone for a while. It's amazing what a panacea that is to the vast majority of men.  The GFE is powerful magic.  It sustains us, recharges, us, makes us feel loved and appreciated the way nothing else can.  They want it from you, of course -- you're (still) their girlfriend, after all.\n\nBut more than likely, that's just not a priority.  Why suck or stroke when you can just go the whole way?\n\nBecause it's not just about the sex.  It's about the affirmation and desire for him.  It's about someone admiring him, admiring his penis with oohs! and ahhhs! and telling him how big it is and other lies.  They want someone to spend some quality time with it, not rush through it while you think about the PTA canned food drive and how you're going to fire that asshole at work -- we can feel that shit running through your heads when you do that, sometimes.  For the real GFE, the look of utter devotion and intense joy you display about being fortunate enough to be the lucky girl who gets to play with his cock is like running on premium fuel.  Regular single working-class dudes will save for months for one night of pure GFE bliss.  Men crave it so much that they're willing to pay a stranger for it.\n\nHere's the thing about bringing the GFE into your marriage.  He can't ask for it, any more than you can ask for a dozen red roses or jewelry, or it doesn't count.  **The Marital GFE has to be given out of pure grace, because you, his girlfriend see that he, your boyfriend, is in need and you want to do something for him out of the goodness of his heart.**  And while making a super-duper pancake breakfast might seem compassionate enough . . . nothing beats the GFE.\n\nSecond, it has to be a surprise.  You must initiate it, and figure out when the best time to pounce is.  Yes, that requires recourse to calendars and schedules and such.  But you can't mutually plan a GFE, nor may he initiate it.  It's up to you.  If he knows its coming, it's just more marital sex, no mater how inspired.\n\nThird, you have to make an attempt to be alluring.  That can be anything from $300 lingerie to that halter top you know he likes to that hooker costume from halloween to being buck naked and quivering in passion.  Hair and make-up, natch.  Making the effort shows you're serious, and that you take him seriously.\n\nFourth, you can't talk about yourself.  At all.  No talk about work, kids, school, friends, family, symptoms, your problems, your hectic schedule, your impossible workload -- once you commit to a GFE, it's all about how much you think of him.  It's not about you (even though it's entirely about you).  Talk about him -- how sexy he is, how much you admire and respect a man that _________ (and make sure he does _______ or it will get weird).  And touch him.  Undress him, caressing every part that gets uncovered.  Play with his non-penile erogenous zones.  Kiss him.  Lots.  But don't talk to him like a wife, treat him like a hot new boyfriend you really want to impress.\n\nFifth, since you, the woman, took the initiative, you, the woman, are in control.  The passive nature of the GFE for the man is part of the allure of the experience.  The feeling of power, joy, and confidence a man feel with some dainty digits wrapped around your dick is exquisite, but so is just sitting there and allowing an expert to perform.her best effort to bring you pleasure.  It's up to you to decide how long, how hard, how deep, and when it's time to finish him off and how.  Let him have that moment of sublime passivity before you bring him back to reality.\n\nSixth, try altering your appearance a bit if you feel he might react funny to his wife making affirmations of his studliness like a teenage girl who just thinks he's dreamy.  Consider a wig of a highly contrasting color, for example, a departure in your choice of wardrobe, even re-arrange the furniture in the living room to provide an air of novelty.  Lingerie is highly recommended, anything from Demure Little Angel to Biker Slut In Heat.  A little dirty talk, an alias (I like the \"Evil Twin\" move), or a long, nasty story while you work his crank is ideal.  You want to engage his sexual imagination, not merely make him cum.\n\nSeventh, make sure you tell him over and hover how hot he makes you.  Yeah, we know it sounds kind of lame.  Do it anyway.  It helps.  We tell you those pants don't make you look fat, don't we?  Turnabout.\n\nEighth: when the inevitable explosion comes, don't grimace, make a face, or otherwise express anything but the utmost joy of providing relief for your special dude.  It sucks to have a good GFE experience ruined when the women jumps up screaming \"OH, GROSS!\" like an ex of mine did (may she suffer an eternal yeast infection).  Even if you don't swallow, at least act happy while it spurts everywhere.  It cleans up pretty easy, y'know.  Then kiss him and tell him how much you love him and appreciate him, and how happy you were to do that for him.\n\nNine: Go away.\n\nThat sounds harsh, but like the esteemed Charlie Sheen between bouts of pornstars and Winning!, *\"You don't pay hookers for sex.  You pay hookers to go away after sex.*\"  As turned on as the GFE might make you (and it just might), part of its allure is the utter lack of expectation in the aftermath of the scene.  You made him cum spectacularly, and now you have to run a few errands or take a shower or something.  DO NOT use his condition of spiritual repose as an opportunity to ask about the direction of the relationship, how good you were (he came, didn't he?) or whether or not this means that you can go shopping this weekend with your mother.  Just . . . go away.  Not for a long while, but for long enough for your dude to appreciate your gift in solitude.\n\nNow, once you return from your errands or whatever, you very well may find your dude an affectionate and devoted dynamo able and willing to do whatever you need him to.  The GFE has the spiritual equivalent of a 4ct. diamond ring he bought you \"just because I love you\".  It earns you serious Girlfriend Points, as well as serious Wife Points.\n\nBecause that's the goal: to get your Husband to treat you as his girlfriend temporarily, and then segue back into \"normal\" routines.  The GFE is a *fantasy*, after all -- those whores are so much better at being \"good girlfriends\" than you ever were, because *that's their job*.  They don't feel as awkward as you as you're telling him how big he is (or probably giggle as much), they have mad skills that come only from long practice on a variety of dicks, and most of them are pretty damn hot, objectively speaking.\n\nBut only you can add the emotional component that blows the back of his skull off.  You don't want to live between his knees every night (damn it), but when your dude is looking down at you looking up adoringly at him, it's a hell of a way to change his perspective.\n\nSo consider it.  Surprise your dude with a custom-fitted GFE some night, particularly if he's been bugging you about sex but you haven't felt \"comfortable\" enough for whatever reason.  Rock his world like you're 19, then scamper off and let him do what he does . . . and you will have made him among the happiest of men.  Without recourse to prostitutes.\n\nI mean, what husband is going to spend $300 he doesn't have to on a handjob in a hotel room when he has a hot, horny girlfriend at home (who looks just like his wife)?  You have to have Charlie-Sheen level money to afford the high end.  And I know plenty of wives who would just as soon whack off hubby at home for *half* that much.\n\nY'know.  Just to make it *interesting*.","title":"Back to Basics September: 'Girl Game: The GFE'","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1fea49x\/back_to_basics_september_girl_game_the_gfe\/"}

Men marry women hoping they will not.\nSo, each is inevitably disappointed. ~ Albert Einstein, maybe, [but probably not]( https:\/\/quoteinvestigator.com\/2017\/01\/17\/marry\/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are many variations of the above quote but each gets to the heart of a very gendered difference in marriage.  As women, we make a bet on a man, early in life, hoping that his edges will smooth and his potential will be reached. Men, on the other hand, take the gamble that his sweet young bride will continue to be the woman that he fell in love with no matter how many years go by.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChange of course, is inevitable.  Our bodies change and our experiences change us. The question to ask is not \u201chave I changed\u201d because of course you have changed. Instead ask \u201cDo I still fit into my wedding dress?\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is a literal question as well as a metaphoric one.  How close are you to the woman that stood at that altar and promised to love and cherish, honor and obey? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nChange is inevitable but how much have you changed and why. Is your waist a touch thicker because age comes for us all or are you popping the seams of the dress? Do you sport a neat braid under your veil or have you sacrificed your locks on the altar of maternity. How about the wedding night lingerie? Are you still the woman who donned it to capture her husband\u2019s attention? Or is it that side of you buried in a drawer, under \u2018routine\u2019 and \u2018responsibility\u2019 to never again see the light of day? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd what of the person you have become? With submission comes [adaptability]( https:\/\/theredarchive.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/malleability-and-you.2904). Have you become a partner more or less like the man you love?  Do you still think of him as the man you walked down the aisle for? Do his eyes still shine when he sees you?  Change is inevitable, but when we are lucky, when we allow ourselves to bend, allow him to lead, then we change to become closer, two parts of a whole. Did you adapt to the path he set you both on, or do you fight to retain independence? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWould he marry you again today or have you moved too far from the sweet young bride? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo you still fit into your wedding dress?","title":"Do you still fit in your wedding dress?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/14y5v70\/do_you_still_fit_in_your_wedding_dress\/"}

Broken up after almost 8 year relationship with a man I wanted to spend my life with, cancelled wedding, lost baby\u2026.. Trying to self-reflect and find motivation to wake up everyday, figure out what I am doing wrong in life as I ended up in this situation.\n\nI had a great man but I\u2019ve lost him. First it looked like it just happened \u201csuddenly\u201d or lately, but I am discovering there were so many indicators from the early stage, all related to my personality and behavior, making me feel like I am completely lost existence.\n\n\\- I never loved myself, not even close, not even little: I never believed somebody can truly love me, because I didn\u2019t see a reason for them to love me. I did not feel like I deserve good handsome man (end result in the end just proved it), but point here is I already went to the relationship with thoughts I am lucky that somebody is even willing to spend some time with me, as I wouldn\u2019t like to spend time with myself. There were just so many negative thoughts in my head, that in the end they became my identity.\n\n\\- That leads to another issue: Believing I have no qualities, I tried to always look better in ex-partner eyes, than I was in reality. I tried to be cooler, not overthinking like a typical woman, not over discussing problems\u2026. I kept crossing my boundaries in belief partner will like me. I was keeping my feelings inside not to hurt him or upset him. Towards the end I realized I don\u2019t know anymore who I am, because in a desperate cravings to be loved I lost myself completely.\n\n\\- Last and the most serious issue is it all resulted in me seeking attention and validation outside of the relationship. I enjoyed men complimenting me. There was even one I flirted with just because I thought I should probably satisfy myself with somebody who has less qualities, as even I don\u2019t have such a good qualities. I thought I should aim less. I thought that maybe I have better chances with a person who is \"just good enough\" (the man I flirted with), than with a man who is the real catch and I love him (because why would such a man stay with me, right?).\n\nIn the end I cleaned up my thoughts and decided to fight for a real catch. But it was too late. I disrespected my partner, I didn\u2019t behave like a lady, and I broke the trust completely. Worst part about it is that I devastated my partner\u2019s self-esteem, and he is never going to believe me nothing else happened. He is never going to believe I did not cheat on him. He is never going to believe he was always everything I wished for.\n\nI live with a guilt I ruined somebody, I will have to deal with it rest of my life. There is only one thing more painful than the fact person you love sees you as such a horrible human being doing horrible things \u2013 and that thing is him suffering because he believe these horrible things are true.\n\nThis happened because all I ever wanted was somebody loving me the way I am. Unfortunately, I never realized I need to start from myself.\n\nI am in no place to play smarty pants now and share any wisdom with you, my women. But if there is one piece of advice I would leave here for you (that I think can help you in life): before you get in the serious relationship, work on yourself, love yourself and make sure you know who you are. Avoid negative self talk because you will become what you think about yourself.\n\nDon\u2019t put all this responsibility on your future partner.

I\u2019ve grown a lot thanks to y\u2019all! I\u2019ve been doing a lot of soul searching, and this was on my heart. I hope it\u2019s okay if I just write it out! \n\nI was raised with things like \u201cnever give your independence up for a man,\u201d and \u201cnever settle for less than you deserve,\u201d with absolutely no expectation of or instruction for being what a good, solid man deserves. \n\nI am visiting my parents this week. I want to preface this by saying my father is a recovering alcoholic and my mother is narcissistic, so those things absolutely contributed to how unbelievably unhealthy and depressing their marriage (and parenting) has been. However, as I\u2019ve learned what being a RPW is, and what the genuine joy and freedom that comes from it feels like, I can\u2019t help but wonder whether their marriage would\u2019ve been healthier had my mother not focused so much on my dad\u2019s shortcomings and how she had to give up her career to raise me and stay home.\n\nTo this day, the second my father comes home, my mom goes off and lists at *least* 5 things he\u2019s done to annoy her that day. Whether it\u2019s leaving something out from getting ready in the morning, or taking too long to pick something from the pantry, it\u2019s just always something. I grew up feeling so anxious and stressed because I knew my mom was so critical of him (and everyone else, tbh), and it always bothered me. Sometimes I\u2019d stand up for him (not saying this was my place to do so), and she\u2019d counter with \u201cWhy are you taking his side? You don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve given up for him and for you.\u201d \n\nMy mom believed marriage was always one-sided, where only the man benefits, and I think that\u2019s why I had such a hard time in the beginning of this, but also why it\u2019s been so freeing to lean into rest and the goodness of kindness, femininity, and joy in being sweet and agreeable. It\u2019s nice to just assume the best of people until proven otherwise, and to not pick battles for the sake of arguing. \n\nI think being raised in an environment where every day was a fight between them, to the point where my dad wasn\u2019t around and wasn\u2019t sober when he was, led me to genuinely not believe that peace and health in a relationship is possible. I\u2019m glad I was wrong, but holy heck do I wish I had known that I was wrong before now. \n\nI just wanted to get this out there and see if anyone could relate or had any thoughts. I know that my mom not being RP wasn\u2019t the only thing contributing to their marriage being difficult, and I believe they both have issues well beyond the scope of a subreddit, but I was just curious to know if anyone also came from a non-RP background and later found peace in going against that. :)","title":"Has anyone else gone from being raised non-RP to choosing to be a RPW?

Since I felt ready to have sex with him for the first time, I came over to his apartment (he lives in the same building as I do). One thing lead to another and after about an hour, we were both tipsy and making out on the couch. \n\nAt one point, he took off my shirt and bra, frowned and immediately tried to put it back on. I asked him what was wrong, to which he replied with \"nothing\". I told him that he can tell me what was wrong, to which he hesitated for a moment and finally admitted that my breasts were saggy and asked if I could wear the bra. \n\nI immediately became extremely upset. I put my clothes back on and said that if he's so into women with Double D, perfect breasts, he might as well go see one. Accused him of being a porn addict (he doesn't watch porn) and a-hole. Told him that I know perfectly well  that he doesn't find me attractive, to which he replied that it's not  true and that he shouldn't have made the comment about my body. I told him that I'm not going to buy such lies and stormed out of his apartment, in spite of him trying to apologize.\n\nI went back to the room in the apartment I rent and  cried for the rest of the night. In the morning, I went to work and checked my phone during my break. Jack called me four times and sent me  ten text messages apologizing for what he said, telling me that he loves  me and calling me beautiful. I replied by asking him to talk about it  in two days, and letting him know that I need some time to cool down. He agreed to do so. \n\nTL:DR He told me about a bodily imperfection and I became super upset and started saying hurtful things. \n\nThe root of the issue (on my side) is the fact that I have very low self-esteem, as well as trouble accepting my body. I didn't tell him about this issue earlier, though, since I thought it would scare him away, and once we became official, it just so happened that I was in a better mental state and didn't obsess over all of my flaws. I also tend to over-interpret things. \n\nAs for his side... I don't know what the issue can be. He doesn't watch porn, but he had three girlfriends prior to me. Knowing how attractive women in Poland can be, and considering the fact that he's really handsome and high-value, I wouldn't be surprised if they were much prettier than I am, hence having higher \"beauty standards\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How have you contributed to the problem?**\n\nI pressured him into telling me why he frowned. I have unresolved self-esteem and body-image issues that I didn't tell him about. I also happen to wear push-up bras that make my breasts appear larger and firmer than they actually are, so he naturally could have been disappointed when he first saw them (prior to that night, I was always fully clothed around him). I accused him of watching porn, called him bad names and didn't answer his calls or texts after leaving his apartment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your current relationship status and length of time?** \n\nWe are official, and have been official for a month. Prior to that, we've known each other for two months, since the day I moved into the area. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ages and state of our sex life:**\n\nI'm 20 and he's 27. Prior to that night, we limited ourselves to kissing and only made out once (he didn't grope me or anything, though). To be honest, I don't want to sleep with him anytime soon, knowing what he thinks about my breasts. I'm also worried that he might dump me if I get pregnant or age, due to my diminishing looks.","title":"My new boyfriend told me that my breasts sag and I got REALLY upset","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/ik3ng4\/my_new_boyfriend_told_me_that_my_breasts_sag_and\/"}

Men are much more suited to being hermits and loners, whereas we women are social creatures who need companionship, especially from a man, to live a happy life. \n\nThe imbalance of power inherent in modern marriage and supported by feminism is largely to blame for so many men dropping out. What incentive does a man have to marry if he is not entitled to sex, his wife isn\u2019t expected to cook or clean (or at least not all the time), and he has the ever-present fear of divorce (facilitated by [no fault divorce laws](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/No-fault_divorce)) and the ensuing alimony\/child support payments, along with limited access to his children?\n\nAt first glance you might think that men suffer more from not engaging in long term relationships, but in reality it hurts women more.\n\nThese days, it is easy for a lot of men to get sex (despite the 80\/20 rule, women are still giving it out like cookies), so it's not that difficult for the MGTOWs to come to terms with their situation. I think I have heard of one WGTOW around these parts...I like to refer to them as crazy cat ladies. It's certainly not a fate I would be happy with. I need someone to balance me out. And while I know that men fare better in good relationships than single men, I think the way modern marriage is set up, they suffer unduly.\n\nI value this community and am glad you are here reading this. While my liberal friends entertain me, they truly don't understand the society-destroying ramifications of it all. They think it's \"a difference in opinion lol and there are always going to be different opinions lol.\" They truly don't get how damaging this is. Society has pretty much fallen apart within my lifetime, but I think it's so new that many don't understand what the future truly holds.\nAnd it's not the beautiful, well-dressed mothers with hard-working husbands in tidy little neighborhoods, like the ones who appear in many of the movies and TV shows women my age like to watch. Unfortunately, only some of these shows drop RP truths, and the rest spout anachronistic feminist rhetoric.\n\nI was recently referred to r\/datingoverthirty. It reveals a lot of the awakening that many women are going through, realizing they don't have ultimate power forever.\n\nI caught a good man at 20 and I'm sticking to him. Though he's been down lately, he possesses all the good qualities that indicate he will pull through and prosper once again. While I am not RP perfect, I think it's easier for a man to accept a 20 year old's stupidity and feminist brainwashing than it is a 35 year old's.\n\nEdit: when I say \"liberal,\" I'm not talking about politically.","title":"Swallowing the Red Pill Is Not a Lifestyle--It's Choosing Society and Civilization","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/75dq0o\/swallowing_the_red_pill_is_not_a_lifestyleits\/"}

What does this mean? \n\n**Defining love** \n\nLove is an emotion which brings two people together. There are a variety of (sometimes opposing) reasons which may drive (different types of) love, but the common denominator between all types of love is that it brings two people closer together. The stronger the love, the closer they will be to one another. \n\nLove is a feeling that isn't rational. Logically speaking, a husband would stop loving his wife as soon as she started to nag, criticize, cajole etc because these things drive him away from her (hence his withdrawal). If love followed logic, very few husbands would love their wives. By the same token, parents would stop loving their children when they did things which cause pain to the parents. But love isn't rational, so husbands continue to love their wives and parents continue to love their children. \n\nLove is what drives giving and generosity. Thus, husbands and parents continue to provide for their wives and children even as they stomp their feet and cause emotional pain. Because love is an irrational bond that brings two people closer together. \n\n**Defining respect** \n\nRespect is earned. You can be loved for no good reason, but you cannot be respected for no good reason. A brain surgeon gets more respect than a regular surgeon because he earned it. A top tier lawyer gets more respect than a regular lawyer. What brings more respect to one person over the other is the level of achievement which earns that respect, what makes one person more loved than the other is the level of closeness to the lover. \n\nRespect is therefore far more logical and rational. There has to be a **reason** to respect. The person has to earn respect and they can lose their respect when they no longer deserve it because they stopped earning it or because they did something disrespectful. OTOH, love doesn't work that way. A person can still be loved even as they're declared guilty of heinous crimes. \n\n**Men own love, women own respect** \n\nThis is why women are obsessed with confirmation of his love and men have a deep need for her respect. \n\nA woman **needs** her man to say \"I love you\", to buy flowers and gifts and for him to continously express his love for her. She expects this regardless of what she does or doesn't bring to the table. She expects it to be unconditional. While true unconditional love doesn't exist, men get pretty close to it in loving their wives. Women instinctively know this and therefore expect him to love her despite all her nagging, criticisms, pms, and any other of her crap he needs to put up with. \n\nA man needs to feel respected by his wife. However, he knows that respect is earned. Therefore, if he isn't being respected, he'll assume that he isn't worthy of it and he'll try harder to earn it. He isn't likely to expect unconditional respect even though her lack of respect hurts him deeply. \n\nThis places men at a disadvantage because nagging, criticizing, cajoling, correcting and other forms of disrespect come natural to women. A man can constantly put you in your place, but that's almost guaranteed to wear him down over time. Certainly, you don't want to be a drag on his mental wellbeing. This is why it's so important to find reasons to respect him for the things he deserves respect for and to flaws which can be overlooked. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nMen own love and need respect from their wives. Women own respect and need love from their husbands. The more you respect him, the more you reward his love. The more you disrespect him, the further away you'll drive him. Meet his love with respect, nurture his love with your respect. You have the soft power of influence. You can make your home a happy home. \n\nCheers! \n","title":"Men love women, women respect men.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6twjjs\/men_love_women_women_respect_men\/"}

Therefore, a man who was interested in sex needed to try to impress a woman, court her and finally propose marriage. This has changed in all of the west except for certain religious communities. Today, premarital sex is the norm. If so, why would a man consider marriage? \n\nAdditionally, marriage has become a huge liability for men. Alimony, child support, custody and rape allegations are all stacked against men. Men are still expected to fulfill all the traditional male obligations but are not to expect the same from their wives. Thus, marriage has become a raw deal for the average western man. \n\nIt therefore stands to reason that if you want your man to marry you, he needs to have a very good reason for doing so. There needs to be something big in it for him. The benefits of marriage has to outweigh the potential risks. \n\nMen generally love to analyze things by a cost\/benefit measure. If the benefits outweigh the costs, we're in. If the costs outweigh the benefits, we're out. The reason why so many men today are shunning marriage is because - in western society - the cost of marriage far outweighs the benefit for men. \n\nIf you don't plan on having children, there's no reason to get married other than religious reasons. Just live together, love each other and commit to one another without the legal entanglement called marriage. If you do plan on having children, here are some things to consider. \n\n**Courtship** \n\nDuring this time, you vet one another to determine whether you're ready to live the rest of your lives together. It's wise to bring up all the big things early on. Be honest and straightforward. This is when you want every potential deal-breaker to emerge so you can go your separate ways if you aren't for each other. \n\nYour SMV will be quite apparent early on, it's your RMV that's now under scrutiny. This is what will take him some time to vet. \n\nIt's my firm opinion that you should have no sex or sexual contact during this period of time. It's wiser and healthier to build a relationship that isn't blinded by pre\/post sex hormones. Have sex when you reach the next stage. \n\n**Commitment** \n\nIn my books, this is when you're married. Once you commit to each other. This is when you should engage in sexual activity. Go at it, don't hold back. The word appropriate means in the right place, at the right time, with the right person. Now that you're commuted to him, he fits the bill as an appropriate person to have sex with. \n\nMen are expected to bring home the bulk of the finances. Show him that you care about his money at every opportunity you have. When he's getting ready to commit, **insist** that you don't need a ring or any other fancy\/expensive item. This will send him a message that you value his money. If he buys you a ring or any other expensive item, reiterate that it's truly unnecessary, be **very** grateful and extra loving as a sign of your appreciation. \n\nYes, a ring is a traditional sign of your commitment. However, with today's different dynamics of marriage, a ring to a man is a financial cost that has little to no benefit to him. He may not readily admit to this (Especially if he fears your retaliation for telling the truth), but this is part of the reason for MGTOW. More and more men feel that things like a ring and big wedding are **expected** whereas things like sex are not to be expected. (Once again, the point of this post is to enumerate some of the things that make marriage more attractive or less attractive to men). \n\n**Marriage** \n\nYou should be together for several years by now and only getting legally married because you're ready to have children. Full trust should be a given by now, but it shouldn't be assumed and expected indefinitely. Remember, marriage is still a raw deal for western men no matter how much he trusts you. If you want him to take the plunge, you ought to address his potential concerns by making it less of a potential raw deal. \n\nThe first way to do this is to always keep him happy. You keep a man happy by keeping his balls empty, his stomach full and your mouth shut. That's it. Three simple things. Active, varied and passionate sex. Hearty, healthy and filling home cooked meals. And a woman who is pleasant to be around, who doesn't nag, whine, complain, cajole, threaten, bitch, ctiticize or offer ultimata. \n\nNext is to write up and sign a prenuptial agreement. You should each have your own legal representation and you should have the whole thing recorded by a professional videographer. You buy insurance for your house and car even though you plan on never using it, a prenuptial agreement is insurance for your marriage. Don't wait for him to raise the issue, you bringing it up will demonstrate your concern for his wellbeing. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nMarriage is a raw deal for western men. Take steps to make it a better deal for your man if you want to make this decision more appealing to him. \n\nCheers! \n\n","title":"Why he might consider marrying you.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/6qjgqm\/why_he_might_consider_marrying_you\/"}

I can't sleep with a stranger because it's super risky, and I won't be able to enjoy it because of my self-consciousness.\n\n\nI thought that was a safe answer. I logged out and went to bed.

These are listed in no particular order. \n\n1. He does not play games. \n\nHe is not shy about commitment, you know where you stand in his life, and you are not nervous to ask questions. Anyone can act interested in you, but he should be focused on you. You should not be confused about what he wants, because men know what they want.  \n\n2. He is reliable. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t show up late, he does what he says he\u2019s going to do, he\u2019s consistent in his efforts and ambitions. When he forgets to do something, or starts slacking, he doesn\u2019t make excuses. He doesn\u2019t wait until the last minute to do everything. \n\n3. He doesn\u2019t half-ass things. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t look for loopholes or shortcuts. He doesn\u2019t push the crumbs under the toaster or shove all the clothes behind a door before you come over. He\u2019s disciplined. He takes his time to do things right. \n\n4. He is responsible. \n\nHe pays his bills, he doesn\u2019t own anything he can\u2019t afford, his house is clean, he\u2019s at least in somewhat decent shape, he eats relatively healthy, he doesn\u2019t drink a ton, etc. He should be able to let loose, but he shouldn\u2019t live in chaos. \n\n5. He\u2019s humble. \n\nHe\u2019s aware of his flaws and is open about his mistakes. He is open to criticism and willing to work on himself. He doesn\u2019t think of himself as the most important person in a room, even if he is. He listens just as much as he talks. \n\n6. He has strong character and convictions. \n\nWhile it\u2019s important to be humble, he also should be able to stand up for himself when push comes to shove. He should know who he is, and that core personality should stay strong. You do not want a doormat. \n\n7. He doesn\u2019t need to be nice, but he should be kind. \n\nBeing nice is refraining from telling you that your haircut looks bad. Being kind is bringing your favorite food because you\u2019re crying about the stupid haircut. \n\n8. He respects you. \n\nHe won\u2019t cross clearly established personal or sexual boundaries, he won\u2019t cheat, he will value your opinion, and he will stand up for you when he witnesses disrespect. \n\n9. He is open about his priorities, and he is goal-oriented. \n\nGoals and priorities are different for everyone. Some men want a family, some don\u2019t. Some want a lot of money, some don\u2019t. Whatever he wants, he will be open about it with you and will respect your decision if you decide that your goals and priorities don\u2019t align. And whatever goal he has, whether it be a promotion or a project, he gets after it. \n\n10. He\u2019s intelligent. \n\nA lot of people conflate intelligence with knowledge, but the two are different. It doesn\u2019t matter if he can quote Aristotle if he cant effectively and logically navigate his life. You want a man who can connect the dots, solve difficult problems, and make sound decisions. This is difficult to vet, because people can be very good at seeming more intelligent than they are. But, some fool-proof ways to spot intelligence are: \n\na. Curiosity. He\u2019s always asking questions, seeking new ideas and information, and researching areas of interest. \n\nb. Quick-witted: He quickly cracks casual jokes that would probably take most people longer to come up with. People like Dave Chapelle, Lex Fridman, Tim Dillon, and Kurt Vonnegut all have different styles of the effortless, conversational humor that I\u2019m talking about. \n\nc. Open-minded: this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he\u2019s easy to change his mind, but rather open to new experiences and ideas, and open to questioning his own ideas. \n\n11. He is cool under pressure. \n\nThis does not mean that he doesn\u2019t get nervous or scared. It means that he can remain logical and calm when he is nervous or scared. He won\u2019t bail out of things last minute, he won\u2019t ask you to have difficult conversations for him, he doesn\u2019t take his stress out on you, he doesn\u2019t blow up during disagreements, etc. \n\n\nIf you can think of any other attributes, feel free to add to the list. But I feel like those 11 are rather all-encompassing. \n\n\n","title":"I think that we need to define what a high value man is.

Build Good Will\r\n\r\nOur partner is our greatest resource when pregnant or taking care of small children. The best way to get what you want is to see that your partner is looked after, then ask them directly for whatever it is you need.\n\nThe simplest way to build good will is to appreciate anything and everything they do. Hell, if they appreciate you for something, you can thank them for noticing. We all want our partner to notice our efforts, no matter how small. And for many of us, knowing we'll be rewarded with praise is additional motivation to take on a new task. \r\n\r\n\t2. Ask Him to Assist You, Not the Baby\r\n\r\nCaregiving is a skill, and like most skills, it feels easy and obvious when you know how to do it and daunting when you don't. Your partner *will* get comfortable with small children, but if you're the primary caregiver, you will gain experience and confidence significantly faster. Watching him fumble in crucial moments when you're at your wits end is a recipe for disaster. \n\nAsk him to help get **you** whatever **you** need, and let him build baby skills when times are good and you have the patience to walk him through it. Things will go more smoothly if he can get you that cup of coffee, as opposed to him watching the baby while you grab the caffeine.\n\nNote: for times this isn't applicable, like when you need a shower, walks with a baby carrier are fairly fool proof.\r\n\r\n\t3. Give Choices When Requesting Help\r\n\r\nIt's mutually enjoyable when I lay out what needs to be done and ask my husband to choose who does what. Asking questions like \"do you want to wrangle Thing 1 or Thing 2?\" lets us get on the same page without me feeling like I'm giving an order.\n\r\nChoices work the best when they seem \"real\", as in, they take roughly the same amount of time and effort to accomplish. Asking if he'd rather get you a glass or water or retile the roof can seem more like an attempt at manipulation than a genuine request for help. \r\n\r\n\t4. Be Careful When Saying You Need More\r\n\r\nHaving small children can be extremely time-consuming and draining. However, it's important to remember that there's a substantial difference between saying you need more, and saying he needs to do more.\r\n\r\nI've told my husband before that when I need help, I wish I didn't have to ask him because I know how hard he works. Both of us can feel like we're putting in a ton of effort, and everything still isn't getting done. To inspire that extra burst of energy in both of you, make sure your tone isn't accusatory. You want to nurture the feeling that the two of you are on the same team. He's far more likely to help if he can be the hero dad lifting up the family, than the loser dad who needs to step up.\r\n\r\n\t5. Spent Your Time and Energy Wisely\r\n\r\nEvery relationship needs effort. Due to how labor-intensive kids can be, you'll likely reduce the romantic gestures you do for your husband. Prioritize what has the greatest effect on his happiness for less effort. \rConsider his love languages and his favorite things you've done for him in the past. What do you have the energy for now? \rPlanning a spontaneous, romantic weekend might be out of the question, but taking a few minutes to add one or two of his favorite treats to the shopping list can go a long way. \r\n\r\n\t6. Intimate Touch is a Must\r\n\r\nThere will be times when sex is off the table. Even for the smoothest of pregnancies, PIV will be advised against post birth until your OBGYN gives you the okay (and please be mindful if you break the six week guideline, as this is a period of hyper-fertility).\r\n\r\nI highly, highly encourage things like flirty touches, casual nudity, and intimacy outside of PIV sex. Something as simple as taking a few minutes to rub his back as he falls asleep at night can really help your partner feel cared for!\r\n\r\nMy personal experience is that my husband's touch was an incredibly help to my self-esteem and happiness throughout the process. I can't overstate how worthwhile an investment I found this to be.\r\n\r\n\t7.  Dad's Night Off\r\n\r\nSomething I've found really interesting is seeing how many parents fantisize about divorce simply because in a joint custody arrangement, they could get time to themselves where they weren't expected to care for the kids. It's so powerful to give your partner time to do whatever it is they want, without having to feel guilty.\r\n\r\nOnce a week, my husband gets off work and has the rest of the night completely to himself. Adding a couple more hours as the solo parent to my plate doesn't cost me nearly as much as those few free hours give him. And getting to be around someone who's happy and appreciative afterwards is really, really pleasant.\n\nAnecdote: \n\nI didn't find negotiating personal time to be effective initially. When I first tried this approach, it seemed like my husband dreaded \"mommy time\" more than he enjoyed \"daddy time.\"  I became frustrated. We argued. When I dropped that idea and gave \"daddy time\" freely and happily, that worked better for us. Then, after a couple months or so, we had a discussion about \"mommy time\" and it went very well. We realized we could sandwich some in over his lunch hour, which worked better for both of us.\n\nI believe building up that good will mentioned in tip #1 culminated in us having more energy to work towards a better solution. And once he became comfortable handling \"mommy time\" on his own terms, it opened the door for us to trade free time. I still like to give him his own time unprompted, but it's nice to know I can now effectively get a break when I need one.","title":"7 Tips to Retain a Loving Relationship with Small Children","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/152bvpb\/7_tips_to_retain_a_loving_relationship_with_small\/"}

I thought I'd throw this out there. First, [an old post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/5qi7l6\/the_fear_of_the_wall_and_why_im_sick_of_hearing\/) that might be interesting to read (comments included), and then my 2 cents.\n\nI left a bad relationship at 23 and it was the Best.Decision.Ever. I wanted a man who would be a great husband and father; my boyfriend clearly wasn't that man. I stayed with him way too long, because I was terrified of starting over. With him, I thought I at least had a chance at marriage and children (no I didn't. Not a happy one anyway. But it was difficult to see it at the time). If I left, would I ever find another man? I always thought I'd be married by 25! What if I didn't find anyone better? What if I got too old? Would I be alone forever? Would it be so bad to stay with him?\n\nEventually, I left. And my life did not end. I took time to recover, live my life, take care of myself, meet people. I was happier! I did not get all saggy and wrinkled overnight, my teeth didn't fall out and my ovaries didn't shrink. I actually still got married by 25... which would NOT have been possible had I wasted any more time on the wrong relationship.\n\nIf you want a long term partner or husband, great! Know what you're looking for. You don't want just *any* man, you want the right man. Vet. Take care of yourself. Live your life. Vet some more. Yes we all know time is passing... but that's just life. You either die young or get old.\n\nPlease stop thinking that you're running out of time and need to \"settle\" for a bad relationship, especially in your EARLY TWENTIES. It's better to be alone than to be with the wrong man.\n\nThanks for coming to my TedTalk.","title":"FR: I left a bad relationship at 23 and my life didn't end.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/14xpa5h\/fr_i_left_a_bad_relationship_at_23_and_my_life\/"}

I don\u2019t think there is. \n \nA theory that gets stated often is that \u201cvaluable partners get into committed relationships early, so as I wait and get older, the eligible bachelors get removed from the dating pool.\u201d\n\nStop. Please. \n\nImmature people partner up early, get married, cheat, and get divorced too. \n\nAre you eliminating divorced men from your criteria? Should you?\n\nWhat if a man is shy, focused on his studies, lands his degree and career, he is 28 years old!! but he heard that it\u2019s \u201cimmature\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d to date women much younger than him. All of you 27 year old women who are certain that you crashed into the wall at 21 would make great partner. \n\nWhat if you are even older? I mean gasp\u2026like over 30? \n\nWell\u2026what if there was a man (he\u2019s 35), very loyal, really wanted to focus on one girl, (the wrong one) and now he is older,  knows more and he\u2019s looking for his true love? If you get along\u2026sounds good. \n\nWhat if you are 50+, widowed, craving companionship. Are you worthless? Is RPW not for you? Nope. Come right in. \n\nMen don\u2019t have a wall. \n\nDo women?\n\nMaybe. \n\nIf you want to be a SAHM trad-wife and you F your way through sugar-baby relationships until you are 29, then yes, you are the extreme example of being delusional that RP men discuss. \n\nBut if you are introverted, changing, growing, doubling-down on insisting that your friendships and intimate partners meet your standards, why do you think you are hitting the arbitrary wall, when men don\u2019t have one? \n\nA man could wake up and say, I\u2019m 32, I need religion, I want to be a dad. We would all tear up a little and say \u201cbravo, beautiful!!\u201d With no discussion of \u201chis wall\u201d\n\nBut what about a 32 year old chick? Yuck. \n\nThere are double standards. Your fertility window matters if you want to have kids. But please stop discussing the \u201cwoman\u2019s wall\u201d as you contemplate pretty obviously miserable, self-destructive, incompatible, potentially abusive, worthless dudes as you worry about your N-count and \u201cthe wall.\u201d\n\nIf the man isn\u2019t right, be brave enough to leave. If you get older as each day passes by, that\u2019s fine. \n\nWhen you truly embrace RPW, even if vetting takes a long time, I think it will be worth it.\n\nEDIT: If you enjoy my ranting style, please revisit:\n\n[Being an Alpha Widow is not Interesting or cool](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/e4524m\/rant_being_an_alpha_widow_is_not_cool_or\/)","title":"Do men have a wall?

However, now I'm second guessing whether I want more children with him due to his health issues. I'm worried that he won't be able to help out or that he's going to die soon and leave me with two children to care for by myself.\n\n\nA little background: we both work full time, both make 6 figures, and he makes a bit more than me. I also take care of 90% of the house stuff (cooking, cleaning, taking care of our toddler, setting appointments, paying bills, etc). I do all of this without complaint, even though I would LOVE for him to help more. He wanted another child before I was, but my hesitation came from the fact that I would most likely be taking care of both children by myself since he doesn't help a ton already. All of my concerns around this were somewhat put to rest after we talked about it, and he said he would watch our toddler more once the newborn was here. \n\n\nSo, all of this is already in the back of my mind. \n\n\nBut last week, we found out he had diabetes after he finally went to a doctor to figure out why he was always tired, losing weight, and low energy. He's been like this for the last couple of years, so it was nice to have a diagnosis. He eats unhealthy foods and smokes, and he has a lot of family history of diabetes, so I wasn't surprised, but he seemed shocked that he was actually diabetic. I guess he thought he was still young (he's 37 and technically has an obese BMI) or that it wouldn't happen to him? I'm not sure why he feels like diabetes is out of the realm of possibility for him. After he got the diagnosis from the doctor, his first response was to say he thinks the results were skewed from him eating lots of chocolate lately. Like it was a temporary blip. Which made me mad, but I didn't show it. \n\n\nEssentially, he hasn't taken it very seriously, and that's what's bothering me. He still smokes and is still eating processed carbs and sugary coffee. The only thing he changed was that he told me to get whole grain pasta. I haven't said anything to him about how I feel about us trying for another baby and about how I feel he isn't taking his diagnosis seriously. I've tried talking to him about his unhealthy lifestyle before (I am healthy, eat healthy, workout, etc), and it didn't help anything, so I stopped years ago. \n\nSo what should I do? How should I approach telling him how I feel? Or do I not say anything? Do we just try for another baby? Am I being stupid? He has a follow-up doctor's appointment tomorrow to address the diabetes, so we'll see what happens there. But I know he needs to make long-term, drastic changes to be healthy, and so far, I don't see that happening.\n\n\n\nEdit 2\/8\/22: I spoke to my husband about my concerns in a calm way, and we decided that pausing on trying would be best. He did not realize how much a second baby would be a change for him because he would have to take a bigger role in helping take care of our toddler, and he feels its best to focus on his health right now. He has a follow-up A1C test in 3 months to see where his levels are at, so he wants to wait until then, and hopefully, he will be heading in the right direction so we can try. Shortly after I posted this, he spoke with his brothers about his diagnosis, and whatever they said seemed to give him the jump-start he needed. After that call, he stopped smoking, he's started following a keto diet, bought a treadmill to start walking every day after each meal, and also is exercising on the treadmill. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e","title":"I don't want more children with my unhealthy husband?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/sm4npj\/i_dont_want_more_children_with_my_unhealthy\/"}

My husband and I (24F 30M) have been married for 2 years. He is the best husband ever and I couldn\u2019t dream of someone better than him. However, there is this one issue that makes the small weekly bickering arguments blow out of proportion. My husband is always right. Not in the sense of \u00ab he thinks he\u2019s always right \u00bb he actually is always right. We might have conversations where we agree, but when we do disagree, I often find that he actually is right after exposing his opinion and challenging mine (usually challenges my opinion until failure because I don\u2019t have enough argument to back it).\n\nThis with time has made me extremely defensive. It\u2019s important to say that he\u2019s always very calm with his tone but I just can\u2019t help being defensive.\n\nExample : we both want kids and want one soon. We had a conversation about it and I told him I think having a child is a massive change because I won\u2019t be able to do what I want anymore, to which he disagreed. We both are retired so we don\u2019t work (thanks to hubby\u2019s passive incomes\/investments) and he challenged the fact that I won\u2019t be able to do anything anymore. He asked me what do I think I won\u2019t be able to do anymore and I said to him well for example go to gym whenever. He said I won\u2019t be a single mother and we will both be equally present for the child and if I need to go to the gym, even for 3 hours, he will watch the kid. He basically agrees with the fact that a lot will change - but for me to say I won\u2019t be able to do whatever I want is not backed up by anything because he has a solution for every situation I bring up and gently reminded me that he will be a very invested father and that it low-key hurts him that I think I can\u2019t count on him.\n\nThis is just an example but this is something that happens constantly and is hurting my self esteem. I often have to admit he\u2019s right and it makes me think that I\u2019m stupid and inarticulate. I actually broke down into tears after the conversation that we had and he didn\u2019t understand why. I explained to him that I feel like I\u2019m always wrong with him- not because he\u2019s evil and want to be right all the time but he just is a very well articulate person that can back up everything he says whereas I can\u2019t. Everytime we disagree he challenges my point until failure because I can't back it properly. I don't have a problem with being wrong, but it's the fact that I'm always wrong with him. I shared these feelings with him to which he said that he doesn't think I'm stupid. He reassured me and said to me that him always being right isn't the reality and he brought up a few scenarios where I proved to him he was wrong and he admitted it. He says I'm creating this idea in my head of him always being right when it's not necessarily the truth. I said to him even if there have been times where I was right, most times, like 90% of the times, he's right and I'm wrong. He replied that it's not a competition, and he thinks I'm very intelligent and a well-articulated person and I've taught him a lot since we've been together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's the sweetest but I know this will happen again. I have this idea in my head that he's just always right and I know when another topic is going to come up again I will get defensive and stubborn just for the sake of being right. How do I stop feeling like this ? I don't want to always blow things out of proportion and be argumentative over nothing. And I don't want it to affect our relationship.\n\nEDIT : thank you so much for everyone\u2019s input ! My husband and I have gone through everyone\u2019s answer and this has allowed me (and us) to have an in depth conversation about the roots of this issue and also how to tackle it in the future.","title":"My husband is always right","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/sbj9qw\/my_husband_is_always_right\/"}

This inevitably leads to ladies worrying that a man will leave his post wall wife for a younger woman. This isn't how we should understand men and the wall and this is one of my favorite Field Reports from my dear friend u\/rubywootoo explaining why that doesn't happen.\n\n\n***\n\nFrequently on RPW, there are a lot of posts about how to keep a man's interest in the long term, particularly how to maintain one's attractiveness after the Wall hits. Throughout these discussions, there's the persistent fear of losing a partner to a younger model. For this reason, I would like to share a personal anecdote and the lesson I derived from it.\n\nMy husband and I were discussing the dating lives of his single male friends and the type of women to whom they're attracted. Curiosity got to me and I asked: \"If you had to describe me as a 'type,' what would that be?\"\n\nHe paused for a moment and replied: \"Jessica Rabbit.\"\n\n\"What?!\" If he weren't such a literalist, I would've chided him for mocking me or for this absurd attempt at flattery.\n\n\"You're just so sensual and womanly,\" he explained. \"You could definitely cosplay as her if you wanted to.\"\n\nUm... no. On my best days, I can probably pull off Betty Boop... but if I'm being honest, those best days are fewer and far between as of late. I'm frequently exhausted caring for our baby twins. I'm still squishy in the middle after having them. I marvel that I even manage to dress in proper clothes rather than succumb to the desire to wear my fluffy Hello Kitty pajama pants all day long.\n\nSo why, of all people, did Jessica friggin' Rabbit come to his mind? Love Goggles!\n\nJust as beer goggles can make a drunk guy go home with a girl he wouldn't even look twice at if he were sober, the love goggles can make a husband look at his dear wife as if she is the femme fatale of his adolescent fantasies. If your partner loves and cherishes you, and you regularly shower him with affection, tenderness, and desire, you don't have to spend your days constantly worried that he's going to bang his secretary because you found a gray in your hair that morning; his love goggles won't notice.\n\nNow, this isn't the blue-pilled bullshit that if a man really loves you, it's OK for you to gain 600 lbs and be a slob. No... if anything, you should feel inspired to be more like the woman he sees through his love goggles. The day after this conversation, I brought my red lipstick out of the bowels of my purse and bought a new push-up bra. :-)\n\nI suppose it's worth saying, too, that the reverse of the love goggles is possible. You could be the hottest piece of ass in your zip code, but if you're a miserable shrew, you probably look like Freddie Krueger to him for making his life such waking nightmare.\n\nHope you find this helpful!","title":"Back to Basics September: Love Goggles","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/py3eec\/back_to_basics_september_love_goggles\/"}

He straight away told me he's intrested in me as a wife and he wanted to get to know me better to see if we're compatible and share the same vision about life, marriage and children. He wants to meet my family... basically he's being this wonderful high quality man.\n\nI come from a poor family, my parents are divorced and we struggle to make the two ends meet. I graduated pharmacy school not long ago and I'm looking for a job to start my career, it's gonna take me some time to raise myself up the ground because I'm literally starting from level zero.

Basically make his life more rich and exciting.\n\nAnd I know I can't do that. And it's not my fault that I was born into this family. I work on myself as much as I can, I take care of my looks as much as I can afford but I can't give something I don't have.\n\nI don't know if this post is a vent or I'm asking for your consolation or advice, I just know that this hurts me..

Not traditional at all. I also come from a very liberal area of a pretty liberal country. The thing that never completly resonated with me was feminism. And the teachings I got from it slowly started to ruin my life. \n\nPart of me was a very feminine woman. I was never career-focused, while I still loved going to school. I consider myself to be smart. \n\nMy mother is a feminist and she always made me feel guilty that I was preoccupied by my appearance and was holding on to my dream find a man to love and have a family and make it to focal point of my life. She was always talking trash about men (especially my dad).\n\nI became unable to trust men fully. And I became sour about them. \n\nI was also ridiculed as a young adult whenever I tried to follow a (what I think is my natural) path, guided by more conservative ideas. I was shamed by my siblings, who made fun of me and called me \"the suburbian wife\".\n\nWanting to conform and because I love them both dearly, I tried to understand their \"woke\" opinions. And I believed them. I was all for non-traditional gender roles. Unfortunately, that lead me to make a lot of mistakes, that I still work on forgiving myself for.\n\nA little more than a year ago, I met my captain. And everything was flowing perfectly, until reality hit and the nagging (from me) started. And a few bad fights resulted, hurting our relationship. And that's when I stumbled upon RPW. \n\nEverything became clear. He was the man I loved, with his preferences, his flaws and his needs. And I had to restore respect. And while it is not perfect yet (it is deeply ingrained in me), my change in behavior helped get us back to happiness. \n\nNow, he comes from a pretty traditional background, but moved here in his early teenage years, without his family, to study. His parents marriage ended up pretty badly. I would say the way his family thinks is VERY VERY conservative. That lead him to find traditional gender roles and conservative ideas pretty laughable. I wouldn't describe him as \"woke\" but he definetly thinks of me as a opiniated feminist. I never wanted to bring up my change if heart regarding this topic.\n\n\n\nHow have you contributed\/attempted to mitigate the problem?\n\n\n\nNow problem is, he saw that I have been on RPW on reddit, and saw in my instagram search history RPW hashtags. And now he makes fun of me for it. He's like \"so you're now redpilled? Hahaha\". So obviously I brushed it off and just went like: \"yeah I researched it to laugh at these crazy ppl lol\". But he keeps teasing me about it. \n\n\nI'm kind of teared between being honest to my man which is kind of a priority to me, or accept that he may think badly badly of me and tease me about it forever. And also him thinking I'm not that great at surrendering if you know what I mean. Because compared to my past self I seem amazing, but compared to you all, I'm such an amateur. I also don't want to push my views on him and make him feel pressured to be more \"assertive\". \n\n\nWhat is your current relationship status and length of time?\n\nWe have been in a relationship together for 9 months. We are in our mid-twenties.\n\n\nTldr; I used to be a feminist and met my captain during that time. Now he has \"suspicions\" that I'm redpilled and I don't know if I should admit it.\n\nEdit: THANK YOU SO MUCH to the person who gave me gold!

I haven\u2019t read it, but I loved the concept, and have been thinking about the idea ever since and how to implement it in my own life, as I can tend toward perfectionism in my journey of self-improvement and in working towards being the best woman, and future wife and homemaker I can be. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in this trait among the women of RPW. Naturally, we are perfection seekers, and work diligently on ourselves and our relationships and marriages. I specifically am a perfectionist when it comes to food. I take pride in my cooking, and have taken on excessive feats in the past, whether I\u2019m making an extravagant steak dinner for my man, cooking for the family at the holidays, or hosting a large party. No matter how well things go, I can tend to be overly critical of myself, especially when things fall short. And I\u2019ll be the first to admit that things fall short (or fall apart) often in the kitchen and at the table. \n\nI\u2019ve killed the yeast in my homemade dinner rolls for Christmas dinner. I\u2019ve served tirami-soup instead of tiramisu due to under-whipped cream and a not-fully-cooled sabayon. I\u2019ve flipped a chicken pot pie over as it was coming out of the oven, ruining a beautiful puff pastry top and killing presentation. I\u2019ve served filet mignon that I forgot to salt, and rushed it back to the kitchen to correct it after the first bite during a romantic dinner. I\u2019ve ran out of green beans at a big party before the buffet line finished through. I\u2019ve accidentally used garlic salt instead of garlic powder on garlic bread and was mortified at the first bite, and again, ran back to the kitchen to pop a few new pieces under the broiler. I\u2019ve burnt the breadcrumb tops of stuffed tomatoes, and burnt my belly on the handle of my cast iron pan right out of a hot oven. I\u2019ve had souffles collapse. I\u2019ve undercooked brats on a camping trip. I\u2019ve stared down cheesecakes as they cool, praying they won\u2019t crack. I can be downright pouty when these slip-ups happen, and even when everything goes right, I desperately search the faces of those I\u2019m serving for affirmation that they\u2019re satisfied with whatever I\u2019ve made, and repeatedly apologize if things aren\u2019t the way they should be. Sound familiar anyone?\n\nI was brainstorming ideas for a romantic dinner with my sister and her boyfriend a few months back, and I asked the boyfriend for advice on the menu. He told me it doesn\u2019t matter what I make, and that I shouldn\u2019t take on anything that will make me stressed out. That if I\u2019m enjoying myself, he will too. I think he\u2019s been a witness to my perfectionism in the kitchen, and gave me wonderful insight that I can sometimes sacrifice my feminine disposition in the pursuit of a perfect meal. Which is totally missing the point!\n\nI have been working on this since, and the concept of Present Over Perfect is a beautiful and succinct way to summarize my pursuit. I have worked to cultivate a more serene presence in the kitchen and at the table, and to have a sense of lighthearted humor when things don\u2019t turn out the way I expect. \n\nWe don\u2019t cook meals for perfection\u2019s sake. We cook meals to bring together those we love, as an act of service, to nourish our bodies and those around us, to bring joy to the table. Cooking is an expression of love itself, and is an artform that doesn\u2019t demand perfection. A poor attitude can ruin the experience for everyone. Be present at the table. Enjoy the company of those you love. Allow the food to add to the experience of togetherness, instead of being a source of stress and fret and disappointment. Learn from mistakes, correct them if you can, but do so with a smile, a pinch of grace, and a dash of gratitude. \n\nWhatever you make tonight, be present at your table.","title":"Present Over Perfect: when it comes to the food on the table","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/bn28vq\/present_over_perfect_when_it_comes_to_the_food_on\/"}

When you see him talking to his cute coworker, when you notice his ex from 10 years ago liking his pictures on facebook, when you realize he's texting a female friend about something or other? \n\nI'm going to bet that the majority of the time, your first instinct, after that initial punch of jealousy, is to draw away, to secretly \"punish\" him for this as a means of gaining power over your insecurity. More likely than not, you're going to want to shit-test him, maybe stop talking as much, sulk, pout, become cold, or any other number of negative things. I'm not judging, most of us have been there before. But the thing to remember is that the more you act cold or try to punish him for a percieved misstep, the more you will push him away, and the more you could end up leading him exactly where your jealous insecurity initially imagined things going. \n\nNow let me be clear -- if you *genuinely suspect* that your partner is cheating on you, that's a completely different story, and calls for a completely different set of guidelines. But if all you're dealing with is, essentially, a hamster run wild with baseless fears, then what follows is meant for you. \n\nSo here you are, walking out of a store with your boyfriend where he ran into an ex and gave her a hug. Uh-oh! You're feeling jealous and possessive. What do you do about it? Do you give into your first instinct, give him the cold shoulder on the ride home, and sulk all through dinner? If your answer is \"yes\" ... girl you have a lot of work to do. \n\n**What to do when you feel jealous**:\n\nThe number one thing to do is to neutralize the initial feeling. This is the one that is definitely the hardest to do. But try to think about the good things the two of you have together, the fact that he picked *you* and not this other person, and other such things. Redirect your mind into something else, and especially something positive. If you didn't catch yourself quickly enough and realize that you were acting rudely, *apologise*. There is no shame in saying, \"I'm sorry I was being cold, I felt a little jealous when I saw Whatshername.\" And then, after you've done that, *go back to your normal self*, and do *not* make it a habit of acting poorly then apologising afterwards. If you do, then your apologies will eventually become meaningless.\n\nSo you've successfully escaped the difficult Ex At The Store scenario. Now what? What happens every *other* time you run into a situation that brings your insecurity to the forefront? Neutralizing the initial feeling is great, but it isn't a longterm solution. \n\nThe longterm solution is to *work on yourself*. If you love yourself, if you realize the amount of worth you bring to a relationship, and if you're comfortable -- absolutely and completely -- with yourself, then you will find your insecurity and jealousy will *not* come up as often. *Always* ensure that you are a well-rounded person. This means that you should not only work on improving one aspect of yourself, but all of them. Do you have a great ass from all the squats you do? That's awesome! But a great ass doesn't make a great person. Always strive to improve yourself intellectually, physically, and creatively --  this means you should try to have one hobby that fits into each category: read books, work out, play music; learn a language, kickbox, paint ... the possibilities are endless. All too often, people think that because they're quite successful in one or two of these areas, that they can neglect the other(s). This isn't the case. Self-improvement is the one place where you should *never* neglect things. And the more you work on yourself, the comfortable and confident you will be -- meaning fewer \"maybe Marcia in Marketing is going to steal my man\", because if you bring everything he wants to the table, he may look, but a good man isn't going to touch. \n\nLast but not least:\n\n*When you're feeling jealous, be better.* \n\n\"I was planning on baking my boyfriend a cake, but I saw him looking at Cashier Carol's butt, so now I'm not going to!\" \n\n**NO**, stop this. If you start feeling your jealousy and insecurity coming in, use it as an opportunity to *treat* your partner. Do something extra nice for him, make him feel even more loved and appreciated than usual. He will notice. Why would you want to do this? Because the more you give to him, the more he will want to give to you. Because by withdrawing affection, you will cause him to seek it elsewhere. Will this happen right away? No, probably not. But it will eventually, and then the only person you'll have to blame for him running to Painter Patricia is yourself. \n\ntl;dr don't punish your partner for something he didn't do; work on yourself; kill your jealousy with acts of kindness and love.","title":"Dealing with jealousy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/8cnawv\/dealing_with_jealousy\/"}

Feminine women don't swear! Feminine women only wear dresses and skirts!*\n\nThese things are all well and good, but these things are not, in themselves, feminine. Taking this kind of advice -- eliminating drinking, refusing to swear, and only wearing dresses -- and expecting to become truly feminine is the equivalent of putting on a white coat and expecting to become a doctor. Sure, most doctors wear white coats; but while that is a *marker* of their status, it isn't what makes them a doctor. And neither do these superficial things make a woman feminine. Perhaps even more importantly, just as a doctor is still a doctor without a white coat, a feminine woman is still a feminine woman in pants with a glass in her hand. \n\nThen what is femininity? \n\nFemininity is a mode of being. It is more action than presentation. Does that mean you should ignore advice to not drink, not swear, and to wear dresses? That's up to you. The wonderful thing about femininity is that it doesn't require faithful observance to specific personality traits. Maybe you're a beer connoisseur, maybe you think dresses aren't practical, maybe you don't want to censor yourself when it isn't necessary. You don't have to, in order to be feminine, as long as you are able to fulfill the most important parts -- the things that are not superficial.

Are your sure? It's harder to pin point than you think, but not as hard a habit to break as you'd think. Here are two of the most common ways we as women \"keep score\":\n\n**\"He doesn't love me as much as I love him because he didn't do x!\"** \nMen and women are different. We all learned that in health class. But the anatomical differences are only the beginning. Our minds are completely different and we reason and operate completely differently, despite what the feminist agenda would have you believe. The way you would solve a problem or draw a conclusion is vastly different from how your SO would. Women focus on the emotional, we can empathize, we pick up on body language and the inflection of one's voice and try and determine what the person *actually* meant. Men listen to the words. (Men feel free to comment if I left any part out, but I am making generalizations here for both genders.) \n\nTo conclude that your SO doesn't love you because he doesn't solve a problem or handle a situation the way you would is a ludicrous. Has it ever occurred to you that you may not always handle a situation or problem the way he would want you to? There are two sides to every coin. You're not happy with every conclusion he's ever drawn? Guess what my dear, he's not happy with all of yours either. \n\n\n**\"I do x, y and z everyday and he complains whenever I ask him to do the dishes!\"** \nWomen seem to think that they are the ones doing more in a relationship. All the time. And they seem to love to be martyrs, thinking they're doing everything so they can throw it in their man's face at a later time. \nJust because you know the *perfect* way to load the dishwasher or you think the kitchen floor should be swept every night before bed doesn't mean he agrees. Who put you in charge of setting the bar of cleanliness in the house anyway? If the house is your \"domain\" and you think you have the best way to do everything, then feel free to do the work. \n\nYour SO and you will see differently on subjects and just because his bar isn't as high as yours doesn't mean he's wrong. Maybe you are, ever think of that? Maybe your SO doesn't mind the floors feeling a little crunchy or if there's dinner dishes in the sink. But you do. Well go ahead and do them. Why do you get to bitch at him for something you want done? \n\nObviously each couple has a different way they split up the chores and share the housework but what it comes down to is this: if it's your SO's job to fold the towels than don't criticize the way he does it. STFU or do it yourself. It doesn't mean he loves you less or that you're better, it means he doesn't care if all the forks are facing the same way in the silverware tray. \n\nThis doesn't just apply to housework, this is just the most popular complaint I see. It applies to raising kids and work outside the home as well. Just because he does it different doesn't mean he does it wrong. Being judgemental in your attitude is condescending and bitchy and will hurt your relationship. \n\n**Breaking the habit** \nKeeping score is detrimental to the harmony and intimacy in your relationship. Putting yourself in the position of judging makes you feel like you're the more superior and will tear down your SO and put up a a wall in your relationship. Keeping score comes out in a variety of ways including using a harsh tone when he does something, rolling your eyes, scolding, nagging and bitching. Feel like your SO is pulling away from you? Who would want to be close to somebody who makes them feel like less of a person 24\/7? \n\nLuckily, it's an easy habit to fix. I recommend:\n\n* Make a list of all of your SO's good traits and the nice things he's done and does do for you. The more you start thinking about it, the more you'll find! Refer back to this list whenever you feel the resentment building up or the hamster start spinning. \n\n* \"Is this the hill I want to die on?\" I love asking myself this when I get aggravated. Is this the event that I want to set the tone for the day? Is this the fight I want to have? Is this the thing that I am willing to sacrifice the harmony in my relationship for? The answer 9.5 times out of 10 is no. So I drop it. \n\n* Ask yourself why is what he's doing or not doing making you feel like you need to keep score. Typically it will be a \"you\" problem and not a \"him\" problem. \n\n* In her book *The Surrendered Wife*, Laura Doyle points out the obvious to us and says that every time we doubt our man (or judge him) we are doing the same to ourselves. We chose this man. Did we really choose so poorly? \n\nI hope some of the advice and examples I gave ring true to some of you ladies and I hope it helps you with your relationships. Red pill changed my life and marriage for the absolute better but it takes a lot of work to get there. But it is so worth it. It's a journey that is never quite finished no matter how long you've been practicing but it does get easier. \n\n~Sadie \n\nPS - If anyone has other examples of keeping score or other ways they broke their habit that are helpful, please post them in the comments! \u2764\ufe0f","title":"Keeping Score in Your Relationship","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4n6uxj\/keeping_score_in_your_relationship\/"}

The fact is, as women, many of you *do* want to date\/marry guys that have a stable job and is financially well off. I am not saying that you are all gold diggers; I am saying that a man who is financially well off, and possibly rich, is attractive to you and more attractive to you than men that don't. Please don't start giving me comments about how your life is different, because studies have shown this to be the case (a quick youtube search should give you a viral video about this topic). I am making a generalization.\n\nThat said, I want to touch on a couple of points we can take away from this.\n\n1) If you honestly have a problem with the relationship you are in, you need to communicate to your partner and address those issues. This woman, in a passive-aggressive manner, shit tested her BF by breaking up with him and wanting him to reclaim her. You know that it was a shit test because just a few days later she messaged him. In short, she was still fixated on him, and tried to get him to chase after her. **Most men, especially not men like Will, will do this.**\n\n2) The fact that she stated \"I'm not a golddigger\" tells me she is a gold-digger. As a man who has managed to save up quite a bit of money for someone in undergrad, this is the biggest red flag for me, and it is also a huge red-flag for a cousin and close friend of mine who are rather rich. My message to you RPW is that you need to understand a couple of different things:\n\n2a) Life is not all about money.\n2b) If you do choose to focus on his income\/assets\/wealth, you need to be honest with yourself and decide on what you want. If you don't like a man who is as frugal as Will is, then you need to find someone that better matches what your partner would be like. That said, keep in mind that the more demands you have (in particular financial demands), the smaller your date able pool becomes.\n\nRead the post. See if you can spot the solipsism and hamstering.

It's been a few years since I've been on this subreddit (with other accounts), but I would just like to express some long overdue gratitude. These strategies really do work, and I'm so glad I found it before I had ever gotten into a relationship.\n\nIn the last 5 years, I went from being someone with severe mental health issues, having no idea what a healthy relationship even looks like, to now being in a *much* better place mentally and blissfully married to my very first boyfriend. We just celebrated our 2-year wedding anniversary. A lot of this, especially my relationship, is thanks to RPW. \n\nMy husband and I share the most loving and happy partnership. We take care of each other in every way and I feel so supported, listened to, and loved every day. Even though our relationship has matured and grown, it honestly feels like we never left the honeymoon stage. We are absolutely each other's rock, he tells me he doesn't know what he'd do without me, and I feel the exact same way. \n\nWe have been dating for 5+ years, yet he still takes me on dates every week, surprises me with gifts big and small, picks me up from work, forbids me from doing the dishes every now and then so he can do it, sends me cute texts all the time while we are at work, and so much more. We hold hands everywhere we go and he has literally made other girls swoon over how he treats me haha. He is also truly the man of the house: he is in charge of all the bills, gives me an allowance to spend on anything I want, and puts over 80% of my income away for me in my own IRA\/bonds\/something like that. I have access to all of his and our joint finances, he contributes more financially, and I barely even do 50% of the chores. He does more than me in every way but he says it's incredibly worth it because of how I make him feel. He says I make him feel like he has succeeded as a man.\n\nDo we argue and disagree? Sometimes, especially when I slip up. However, the disagreements are always resolved quickly and completely, and we are often stronger for it. We are both quick to apologise when wrong, and quick to make up, and it never gets brought up again after we resolve it. \n\nI am by no means a smoke show (pretty cute at best haha), and I started with about the worst background you can think of. My mother was an emotionally and physically abusive narcissist, my father was almost entirely absent, and I had so many insanely horrible habits, terrible mental health, and many BPD-like symptoms. Aside from my husband being the kindest, most patient man on earth, I attribute my success to a lot of self-improvement, therapy, and the fact that I found this sub before we even started dating.\n\nIf there is any interest, I would love to write about the RPW strategies I found the most useful, and how to implement them when you come from a background of trauma and abuse. I stopped engaging in this subreddit after RPW strategies became almost second nature, but I always promised myself to contribute back if I find the time. \n\nThanks again to all the contributors of this subreddit. I owe so much of my happiness to you. \n\n--\n\nTo anyone reading who is not sure about the effectiveness of these strategies, I have the following quick advice for you\n\n* RPW, at its core, is helping you act like you actually love your partner and give a shit about their feelings. That's all it is. \n* As such, RPW is a toolbox. Take what works for you and discard the rest. I certainly don't implement every RPW strategy. You also don't need to lean some way politically or socially to use it. My husband and I are actually very left leaning, progressive people, and I am very career focused, and it still worked wonders for us. \n\nGood luck!","title":"Thank you, RPW, for my amazing marriage.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1g3ihck\/thank_you_rpw_for_my_amazing_marriage\/"}

We both come from a family that is mixed between traditional and liberal \u2013 with different people going different ways. We are both probably the most traditional leaning two in the family.\n\nWe are both currently single but both want to be in traditional relationships (with other people, not each other) with the man as the head of the household and the woman as the nurture.\n\nI was talking about how the natural order of things is for the husband to go out and work and it is the wife\u2019s job to nurture the home by doing things like decorating, cooking, cleaning, washing and so on. My relative agreed with me but seemed tentative. I pressed him for why he was hesitant and he told me that it seemed demeaning for women to be in that role.\n\nI pushed back and said that this was often how traditional women express their love for their husbands, household and children and that it was demeaning to call those acts of love demeaning. He then clarified and said that it \u201cseems\u201d demeaning, not that it actually is \u2013 probably because of new feminist ideas he has had pushed on him his entire life. He then said \u2013 for example \u2013 that he would not be able to just sit or go off after a meal and leave his wife to wash up, he would feel compelled to help her.\n\nI then told him that if he was at work all day to bring home the bread as a loving action to her, then it is only fair that she should cook for him and clean up. After all most meals he likes only takes 30 minutes to a hour to make and putting the crockery in the washing machine only takes 20 minutes at most. I then said that if he helped her or did it for her, he would be denying her a way to express her love for him by an act of service.\n\nHe thought about it for a bit and said he would try to accept it but for some reason it still made him uncomfortable. He said he could probably get used to it in time, but only when they were alone. If they had people over \u2013 such as more liberal family members \u2013 he would feel compelled to help her to save face.\n\nI said that he should hold firm and display to his visitors how his household works \u2013 that his wife does the cooking and cleaning up as a loving act of submission to him to demonstrate a healthy, good and loving traditional relationship. He agreed but then brought up a rather fierce aunty of ours who would probably yell at him as she thinks it is usually fair for everyone to pitch in on everything.\n\nHe said he would not be able to defend himself as speaking for his wife and saying she was fine in this situation would look controlling; he said he would need her to speak up and say that she liked serving him in such a fashion and insist on doing the dishes herself.\n\nHe still seemed a bit uneasy.

Apparently traditional men get attacked a lot by feminists who think they are subjugating their wives.\n\nSo should it be placed more on the women to defend their traditional men from feminists?

Unless you and your SO have *incredibly* mismatched libidos, it\u2019s a save bet that your man wants more sex. What we don\u2019t often realize, is how strongly a man feels this need or why. This chapter explores just how important sex is to men and more importantly **what sex means for men and why it is so important**. \n\nThe author was unsurprised to find an *urgent theme* that arose from her surveys: men want more sex. What she discovered when men opened up more is that men believe that women don\u2019t understand that this need is a crisis for both the man and the relationship. \n\nWomen who understand that men need sex, tend to view it as a physical need. It is not hard to come to terms with that idea. What we miss is how much emotion men attach to sex. **Though there is certainly a physical component, sex fills a powerful emotional need**. And, because men don\u2019t describe sexual needs in emotional terms, we often don\u2019t realize it. **The lack of sex is as emotionally serious to him as his sudden silence would be to us. It is just as wounding and just as much a legitimate grievance.** \n\nRemember all the previous chapters where we talked about men\u2019s insecurity, feelings of inadequacy, the burden they feel? A man can feel isolated and burdened by these feelings that he never discusses. Sex assures him that he is desirable. It eases the loneliness and allows him to face the world with confidence. He cannot feel completely loved without it.\n\n*In his heart, he wants to be wanted.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo explore this idea further, the author asks the following survey question\n\n> Q: Regarding sex: with some men it is sufficient to be sexually gratified whenever he wants, for others it is also important to feel sexually wanted and desired by your wife. *How important to you is it to feel wanted by your wife?* \n\nThe question gets to the nature of sex. If it is the act itself, then men should be happy as long as they are receiving as much sex as they want. However, less than 1% claimed that feeling wanted was irrelevant as long as he got enough sex and only 2% said that it wasn\u2019t very important to feel wanted. A full 66% said it was very important and an additional 31% said that it was somewhat important. **For most men, the sex act alone is insufficient**.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that we women are intentionally withholding something that we know is critical to our partner\u2019s well being. What is more likely is that women don\u2019t realize the emotional consequences of our responses, or lack of them. We perceive the desire for sex as a physical desire or if we\u2019re being cranky and unkind, an insensitive demand. For the sake of our relationships, it\u2019s important to understand the truth behind our men\u2019s advances.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Why is sex so important?\n\nIn the surveys two trends emerge. The first considers the benefits of fulfilling sex and the second the hindrance that rejection creates. \n\nAcross the board, men reported that having regular mutually enjoyed sex life was critical to their feeling of being loved and desired. \n\n> I wish that my wife understood that making a priority of meeting my intimacy needs is the loudest and clearest way she can say *\u201cyou are more important to me than anything else in the world\u201d*. It is a form of communication that speaks more forcefully with less room for misinterpretation than any other.\n\nMany men, even those with close friendships, seem to live with a deep sense of loneliness that is foreign to us women. Making love is a balm for that loneliness. It means there is one other person in this world he can be completely vulnerable with and not judged. \n\nFulfilling sex gives him confidence. As we touched on in \u2018imposter\u2019 chapter, most men ask themselves \u201cdo I measure up\u201d. Our support and affirmations help our men to feel confident of their place in the world. Sex is just an extension of this idea. Your desire is a bedrock form of support that helps him face his daily life with confidence and wellbeing. Men are more confident and alive when their sex life is active and rewarding. \n\n> Q: imagine your wife was an interested and motivated sexual partner and you therefore had an active love life, how would having sex with her as often as you wanted, affect your emotional state? \n\nAbout a quarter of the men surveyed (23%) said that sex is unrelated to emotions or how he felt about the rest of his life. For these men sex on demand would have little to no impact on his life. However, the remainder, a full 77% said that it would have a positive effect and that he\u2019d have a greater sense of well being and satisfaction with life. Ask yourself, what is the likelihood that my man is in the minority? \n\nMen tell us this all the time, but again, because they don\u2019t speak in emotional terms, we *hear* the man code for this fact but we don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s actually saying. When he says he feels better when he has more sex, it\u2019s easy to assume that he means it in a purely physical way. This is wrong, men repeatedly tell the author. They feel better and life feels better when they are getting enough active and mutually appealing sex. Put simply, it helps release life\u2019s pressures and makes everything *feel* better.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###What happens when he doesn\u2019t get it?\n\n> If she doesn't want to, I feel incredible rejection. \n\nMost men would rather do onerous tasks than have sex with a woman who is responding out of duty. The guy isn\u2019t going to be rejected by his chores whereas duty sex feels like a rejection. \n\nIf you are responding because you have to, he knows it, and feels the sting of rejection. Remember that what he wants most is to be desired. If you agree to roll around in bed, but once you get there, you aren't engaged, he isn\u2019t going to view it as something you do out of love.  He hears *\u201cYou are incapable of turning me on even if you try and what is most important to you, isn\u2019t important to me\u201d.* If you flat out reject him with say, the standard: *I\u2019m tired honey*,  he hears *\u201cYou re so undesirable, you can\u2019t even compete with my pillow, and I don\u2019t care about what matters deeply to you\u201d.* \n\n**None of us *mean* this of course. It doesn\u2019t always matter what we mean, what he hears and feels are the pill that must be swallowed here**.  We may just be saying *I don\u2019t want sex at this moment\u201d, but he hears that you don\u2019t want him and that is painful. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Men Speak: \n\n> She doesn\u2019t understand that I feel loved by sexual caressing and if she doesn\u2019t want to, I feel incredible rejection.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> \u201cNo\u201d is not no to sex, as she may feel, it is no to me as I am and I am vulnerable as I ask or initiate. It\u2019s plain and simple rejection.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> She doesn\u2019t understand that even her occasional dismissals make me feel less desirable. I can\u2019t resist her. I wish that I too were irresistible. She says I am but her ability to say no so easily makes it\u2019s hard to believe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe feeling of rejection and the feeling that his wife doesn\u2019t really desire him can lead a man to dark places. One only needs to visit the other RP subreddits to see the impact these rejections have on men. \n\n**Your lack of desire can send him into depression**. If your desire gives him a sense of well being and confidence, then you can understand how the opposite holds true as well. The ongoing perception of a lack of desire will translate to a nagging lack of confidence, withdrawal and depression. \n\nMen scoffed at the author\u2019s push back. *A string of rejections doesn't *necessarily* mean she is rejecting you as a man* say women, *We are tired, we work too and care for the house and the kids. Just because we don\u2019t want sex, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want you.* Men warn us back: *Any woman sending those signals will undermine the loving environment she most wants because she\u2019ll have one depressed man on her hands*. \n\nIf you still can\u2019t wrap your head around it, the author compares men\u2019s need for sex to women\u2019s need for talking and communication. Men can\u2019t turn off the physical and emotional importance of sex. Regularly turning him down feels the same to him as his sudden silence would feel to you. Imagine how you\u2019d feel if your husband didn\u2019t talk to you anymore, or acted as though connecting with you through conversation was something he did out of duty. \n\n> We\u2019ve been married for along time, I deeply regret and resent the lack of intimacy of nearly any kind for the duration of our marriage. I feel rejected, ineligible, insignificant, lonely, isolated and abandoned as a result. Not having the interaction that I anticipated prior to marriage is like a treasure, lost and irretrievable it causes deep resentment and hurt within me. This in turn fosters anger and feelings alienation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###How can we overcome the sex gap? \n\nWe must choose to love him in the way he needs. If you are viewing his need as physical, that is, important, but perhaps options, then you must stop and wrap your head around this chapter right away! When viewed this way, it\u2019s too easy to make the argument that your need for sleep is just as important as his need for sex. \n\nIf you realize that he\u2019s actually saying *\u201cthis is essential to my feeling of being loved and desired and to counteract my feelings of stress and loneliness\u201d* your response should be very different. It is always ideal to respond to his invitation with your full emotional and physical involvement, knowing that you are touching his heart. \n\nHowever, there are going to be times when you realistically *cannot* manage sexual intimacy with your partner. If you must say no, say with with words from the heart. Make sure that you are being reassuring, reaffirming and adoring. Leave him in no doubt that you love to love him. Through in the fact that you desire him for good measure. Promise to show him later if you can.  \n\nAnd if you say no in a way that reassures him, it can be better than saying yes and then engaging in emotionally detached starfish sex. If you respond physically but without meeting his need to be engaged and desired, STOP! If you are having sex with him, be engaged, you aren\u2019t meeting his needs otherwise. \n\n**You must take an active role in sex**. Many men want a wife who is sexually motivated. TRP and the Christian men that the author interviewed agree. Men want their women to be *his slut*. The religious men are *slightly* more circumspect. They say they want: * a girl next door in the living room but a wildcat in the bedroom*. This means you should make the first move from time to time and bring all you attention and passion for you man into bed with you. \n\n**Make sex a priority**. Ask yourself, are the needs you are meeting the needs he wants met? Does he care about the dishes getting done or does he care about sex? Don\u2019t focus as much on what you want to get done at the expense of your intimate relationship with your SO. Reevaluate your priorities, you can even do this with his help!\n\n*You can be a great wife in every other way, but not doing this one thing that is important to him, and he won\u2019t feel loved.*","title":"Back to Basics September - For Women Only Sex","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/pyse0a\/back_to_basics_september_for_women_only_sex\/"}

I am a highly sexual person, but I'm not aroused by the thought of sleeping with someone I don't have an emotional connection with. In today's climate, this makes me more traditional I suppose. With modern feminism and hook up culture, I've found my natural inclination for waiting for sex and wanting it to be special to be out of the norm and laughable, to both men and women. My first experience with a boy when I was 16 resulted in him dumping me for not having sex with him soon enough. Similar experiences followed, as well as people laughing at me because I was a virgin, calling me extremely \"innocent\", and more. I blame modern feminism in part, for saying things like \"be a slut\" and encouraging women to sleep around, as if we are naturally oppressed and that is what we should do. Not only this, but I have my own sexual trauma and sexual shame from childhood which has made it hard to feel fully comfortable in a sexual scenario. I need a loving man who I fully trust in order to open up.\n\nIn my early college years, I thought something was wrong with me for feeling the way I do about sex. I thought that hook ups were the pre-requisite to the loving relationship I'd always wanted. The only ways girls seemed to get boyfriends was by having sex with them. Everyone talked about how they \"hooked up\" and then started dating. So, a few years of sexual trauma characterized my life. I was in an abusive relationship on and off for a few years, and in between them, I tried to hook up like my friends because I thought that was what was normal. For each of these encounters I still wanted a relationship out if it, I just slept with guys when *I didn't really want to.* I had to get black out drunk every time because my body literally was not aroused, I felt uncomfortable, and didn't naturally want to. Through therapy I have come to terms with the fact that I am not inferior for wanting an emotional connection during sex, and that that is actually normal and beautiful. I finally recently had a wonderful relationship where for the first time I was able to explore sex in a healthy way where I actually enjoyed myself and felt connected to my partner. Unfortunately that relationship has ended.\n\nAlthough I've done a lot of work to accept my more \"traditional\" view of sex and love myself, for some reason, whenever I hear about my female friends having casual sex and\/or having sex with men immediately then getting into relationships with them, it makes me feel incredibly inferior to them. I feel like I cannot get what I want, a loving relationship with a man who takes care of me, through my \"traditional\" view of sex. One of my friends hooked up with a guy twice her age over tinder, and they actually fell in love and are having amazing, wild sex and he buys her things, is obsessed with her, and treats her extremely well. And yes, they have an emotional connection and are in love with each other. It just seems like my friends, who are beautiful and smart, are able to having these amazing sexual experiences AND relationships through having casual sex\/having sex right away with someone. I, on the other hand, feel as though my desire to wait to have sex until I fully trust someone sets me back somehow. When I hear about my friend's experiences, I feel a deep sense of shame in my chest. Its a voice saying \"you're not good enough.\" \n\nMy \"traditional\" view of sex as well as my own sexual shame (that I am trying to overcome) make me feel inferior. I want a loving relationship with a lot of great, intimate sex more than anything, but I feel like I'm just not good enough to get that. I'm not as \"free\" as these other women, not as sexually \"enlightened\". I can't attract a quality man because I am not as sexually \"open\". Anyways, sorry for the length, I obviously have some personal problems with sexual shame. My friend just told me about her casual sex encounter last night and it triggered me. I guess I am just looking for advice or consolation anyone may have to share about this, or if anyone can relate to what I've just said. I want to feel 100% okay with who I am.\n\n**Tl;dr:** Modern feminism, social shaming, my own sexual shame and trauma, and my natural inclination to want an emotional connection to have sex, have amounted to me feeling inferior to other women who have casual sex with men. Hearing about my smart and beautiful female friend's sexual encounters makes me feel inferior and triggers me. I want to become more at peace with who I am and my \"traditional\" view of sex - I want to have faith that I can still have the relationship I want despite not being like them.","title":"I feel inferior and like the \"odd one out\" when hearing of my friend's casual sexcapades","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/has29g\/i_feel_inferior_and_like_the_odd_one_out_when\/"}

My dad has always been a bit distant, but it has grown worse as the years have passed. And I blame my mom for some of that. My mom has taken it upon herself to be the head of the household. She claims it's because he won't step up to lead himself, but she often yells at my dad for not doing things, makes fun of him, talks badly about him to my sister and I behind his back, etc. She is everything I desire NOT to be. However, my mom is the only one that disciplined us, made sure we had everything we needed\/wanted, and feels like a parent to me. I've tried to tell my mom not to act like that with my dad and I gave her some red pill advice, but she hasn't taken it or applied it at all. I've brought up my lack of connection with my dad to him before, but he just still won't make an effort. And because of this, I have always been looking for a \"father figure\" in other older men. I get along so well with my male professors that I will often go in to their office hours and talk about class, life, or whatever. I place them in that role and then get sad when the semester is over. It just hurts that I can get along so well with my older male professors and that they love talking to me, but my own dad doesn't even want to get to know me. I know I should be grateful that I even have my dad because some people don't have their dads present in their lives, but my dad lives with me and it feels like he doesn't want to be in my life most of the time. He doesn't know me at all. He's a passive father and husband. He'd rather stay at home watching tv or being on his phone\/computer than to go to my choir concerts. He's so plugged in to technology that he doesn't like leaving the house other than to go to work. He won't go to the movies with me, even if I know it's a movie he would want to see. The funny thing is that his favorite Christmas movie is \"Jingle All The Way,\" which we watch every single year and if you haven't seen it, it's a movie about a man who does a bad job at being a father but then turns it around and becomes a family man by the end of the movie. It's like he dreams about being better, but he doesn't do anything about it. I don't know what to do, how to deal with this, and how to heal from this.

What this means in reality, is that we don\u2019t often communicate in the same way as our men. Caring men *want* to communicate with their women. The problem arises because how they go about it is different from how we might prefer. Understanding that there is a difference goes a long way to smoothing over conflicts. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###How to read his signals \n\nHow many of you have hear something like this before: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking... I just need a few minutes to decompress before you hit me with your day... Can we please talk about this later... Sorry honey, did you say something?\u201d \n\nWe might feel hurt or brushed off when he says these things so it\u2019s important to remember that these are not signals of a lack of care. These signal the difference ways in which men process and talk about emotions.\n\nMen have to *think* something through before they are able to *talk* something through. We women are completely different because we usually think it through *by* talking it through. This actually comes down to a bit of brain science. The connections between hemispheres of the brain allow women to do fast, surface processing of many ideas at the same times. We will circle through options and this gives us more clarity and helps us feel better. \n\nMen do not process the way we do at all. They are internal processors, he has to think about it before it\u2019s possible to speak about it. It is actively difficult for many men to think something through *by* talking it through. A man\u2019s brain is wired to process one thing at a time and he goes deep on each topic. Your average man can talk about it, feel about it, or think about it but rarely all at the same time. \n\nPressing your man to talk, especially *right now*, only makes it harder for him to think through the topics that you want to discuss. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s even harder if there are emotions involved, like when a \u201cdiscussion\u201d is really code for an argument. Often men\u2019s preference is tol step away so that he can get distance to think first. \n\nAnd boy does he think it through. When you are talking through every possible scenario and feeling with your girlfriend, he\u2019ll be reflecting on each and every option quite deeply. He does this by considering the first line of thought as completely as he can. Then once he is finished that thought along with all it\u2019s implications he will move on to the next line of thought \/ option \/ scenario. Once he has run through the scenarios he will consider his feelings and all the implications about that.  Then, finally, after he\u2019s examined everything he\u2019ll be ready to talk to you. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking or feeling\u201d is Man for:  \u201cI don't know what I\u2019m thinking or feeling *now* but I will know later once I have time to process everything\u201d \n\nEven more important, if a man is going to **talk** about something important, he needs to know that so he can include \u2018how do I communicate this\u2019 in the processing. Some men explained to the author that it is possible for them to think through everything and still not be able to talk about it. If they know ahead of time they will have to explain \u2018why\u2019 then that gets included in the thinking process.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###**Emotions inhibit the ability to articulate**. \n\nMen\u2019s brains are more geared to act on things whereas women\u2019s brains are geared to talk. This difference means that women often perceive men as having no feelings. This could not be further from the truth. Men have as many internal feelings as we do, but they don\u2019t always have words to put to the feelings. It is easier for men to *do* something about their feelings than it is for them to *talk* about their feelings. The author explains it this way: \n\n> Guys don\u2019t like to talk through things on the fly because they don\u2019t know where the conversation is going. Not knowing where the conversation is going causes discomfort whereas for women it\u2019s the whole point. On the flip side, men don\u2019t like to ask for directions because there is a sense of adventure in figuring it out. A woman, on the other hand would feel uncomfortable driving without directions because she doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019s going. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###**Men need time**.\n\nThe solution that enables men to properly think things through is so basic you probably already know it. Men need time apart. This is particularly true on issues of emotional importance but really with any important issue men need time and space for their internal processing. This can mean a few hours to a few days depending on the guy and the issue. \n\nIn the surveys men said that they felt better able to talk about something big the next day. Brain science backs men up here. **Men more than women will not know what they feel at the moment of feeling and will take longer to figure it out**. It will also take men longer to express feelings into words. Science tells us that it takes a man, on average, about a 7 hours to process something emotive. One man explained that he needs a cooling period before being able to rationally work through what is wrong. Some men do just \u201ccheck out\u201d (ie: they aren\u2019t processing anything, they are just avoiding) but in the research this is rare. **Give him processing time, your discussions will be much more productive and communication will be smoother if you do**\n \n&nbsp;\n\n###**Men think through everything**. \n\nWe often make the assumption that they take action and don\u2019t think at all. This is, of course, only an assumption we making when he does something we disagree with. We then stare at him as if he\u2019s grown a third head and exclaim: \u201cWhat were you thinking!\u201d  What we mean, and what he hears is: \u201cYou weren't thinking you naughty boy!\u201d. And we all know the problem with that implication. \n\nOver the course of researching the book, the author began to ask friends if she could jump in when she saw situations of conflict. She\u2019d ask the husband \u201cWait! What did you think before you did that?\u201d Inevitably the man comes out with a long list thoughts that ran through his mind before he took an action. She discovered that **there is always reasoning behind every action**. \n\nWhen surveyed, 8 out of 10 men said that when taking an action their wife didn\u2019t like that they **had** thought about it ahead of time. What\u2019s more, \u2153 had even considered (and dismissed) their wives\u2019 objections. \n\nOnce again, we are brought back to the respect chapter. When he does something that we find inexplicable, do we respect our men as rational adults with pure motives... or are we thinking \u201cwell that was stupid, what was he thinking?\u201d  Mistakes are inevitable - a man\u2019s ideas won\u2019t always work out, but our ideas won\u2019t always work out either. Disagreement is healthy and sometimes necessary. It is important that we go into a discussion or disagreement assuming the best intentions of your mate. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###**Sometimes men need to think nothing**. \n\nA man is going to need time when he doesn\u2019t have to think of anything at all. Do you rush him at the door or give him space? Because at the end of the day, when we want to talk, he probably just wants to collapse and channel surface. The same processes that require men to think and process everything on a deep level also mean that a man needs time to reset. He\u2019ll accomplish this reset by doing something mindless that helps him to \u2018make more room\u2019 in his brain. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Work with the way your man is wired instead of against it**. No one is suggesting that our partners shouldn\u2019t also make an effort to work with how we are wired, but this is about you and what you can change. We can adapt and do things that are important to our men even if those things don\u2019t come naturally. Since some realities don\u2019t change, like the way their brains are wired, we\u2019ll be so much better off if we bend our behaviors to fit their needs. Give him time to process before asking him to communicate (*Honey, I\u2019d like to talk about X, when would be a good time?*), or give him time to empty his brain before dumping more on him (*that half hour after work that he needs to unwind can be crucial*). \n\nIf you are unsure ask him how long \u201clater\u201d means. Demanding our men discuss things before they are ready can even hit their insecurities as men. If he can\u2019t process as quickly as we can in a discussion, he may feel insecure, unable to communicate or less smart. \n\n**Make the best assumption of your mate. Recognizing and understanding how men process thoughts can help to alleviate so much conflict within the relationship.

In fact, some go as far as to say that arguing is *good* because the strong emotions exhibited are the kind that show you truly care about the relationship. However arguing creates an antagonistic environment. It fosters a \"me vs you\" atmosphere, rather than a more ideal \"me and you vs the world\". The strong emotions of that you create in the relationship don't have to be used against the person you love, instead they can be used *for* him.\n\nIn order to stop arguments, it is important to understand why they occur. A typical argument has two components a **spark** and an **ignition**.\n\n**Spark:** The spark is the seed that starts the argument. It can be almost anything, provided that the listener has a negative emotional reaction to it (we'll get to that later). It can be something seemingly innocuous, like mentioning that the pizza is cold, to something disrespectful like saying that someone \"can't get anything right\". Normally we do not act like, or hang around, someone who would do the latter.... that is why often people will look back on an argument and wonder why they were arguing about something so stupid. That is the spark.\n\n**Ignition:** The ignition is what happens when someone has a negative emotional reaction to a spark, and responds accordingly. This can manifest itself in either offensive (\"You screwed up last time\") or defensive (\"It's not my fault\") behavior. Once the spark is ignited, the argument escalates until one person chooses to end it (either be giving up their position or walking away).\n\nWe often hear the common wisdom that an argument takes two people. While this is true, it is important to understand that you can only control one of those people's behavior, your own. Here are some things you can do that can stop arguments before they begin.\n\n**Step 1: Don't create the spark.** Watch yourself and try to make sure you are not creating sparks in your relationship. If you are nagging, condescending, or rude this is especially important. \n\nIn addition to that, try to learn and pay attention to your SO's triggers (we all have them). Does he dislike when you cross your arms? Does he hate when people chew with their mouth open? Does he not like you saying negative things about his mother? Avoid triggers whenever possible, and if you have to go near them, tread cautiously. \n\nHowever you will not always know what will upset someone (remember sparks can be innocuous) so you can sometimes create a spark by mistake.\n\n**Step 2: Don't ignite the spark.** If your SO set created the spark do not respond negatively to it. Normally (unless you have chosen a poor captain) your SO will not intentionally make you angry. He may have to tell you that you made a mistake, or he may step on one of your triggers by accident. If this happens you have a choice to not be angry. If you choose not to respond negatively there won't have to be an argument. Ask yourself \"is this the hill I want to die on\"?\n\n**Step 3: Defuse the situation.** If step 1 and 2 don't work then there are some techniques to keep the situation from escalating. One typical example is if you create a spark by mistake, he takes it, and now you are standing right at the brink of an argument. Even at this point, *you can still choose not to make it an argument*, however if can be harder if you let yourself get emotional and angry.\n\nTips:\n\n* Listen earnestly to what he is saying. An argument is what happens when being right becomes more important than listening. Put away your pride and acknowledge and respond to what he is saying. Whether you believe he is right or not, it it is important to understand where he is coming from so that you can come up with a solution together. Give him his turn to speak, then he will let you have yours. Understand that he thinks he is right just as much as you think you're right (otherwise there wouldn't need to be an argument).\n\n* When you prepare to talk to him try to not focus on why there is a disagreement brewing, but rather on how you feel about the situation. If you are able to get angry over this, ask yourself, \"why is this so important to me?\" Once you do speak, choose your words with deliberation and consideration.\n\n* Use noncomplementarity. It is only natural when someone gets angry to want to be angry back and up the ante, that is referred to as \"complimentarity\". This phenomenon is what keeps arguments going, and what escalates them. One well-known de-escalation technique is to become calmer and quieter if the other person is becoming angrier and louder. Another is to do use counterintutive behaviour, the opposite of what would normally be expected. Try making a joke (not as his expense) or doing something downright silly. If you're lucky you may even get a laugh out of him, either way, if you do it right, it will remind him that you are not the enemy here. When done right this can instantly stop on argument in its tracks. \n\n* STFU. As a last resort, if you are angry and want to say something that you know you will regret, keep you mouth shut until you have regained your composure. Not saying anything is better than giving into the argument. \n\n* Be willing to be wrong. Remember an argument is most of the time a difference in point of view. Just as you find your reasoning valid, he also finds his reasoning valid. Try to view things from his perspective so that you can at least understand where he is coming from. If you can understand his point of view you can turn any argument into a discussion.\n\nWith the right techniques you will start to look like the solution to his life problems, and not like the cause of them. Not all these techniques will work for everyone, in every situation. Choose the ones that work best for your relationship, and the ones that will work for you and your SO. \n\nLastly, remember one of the benefits of the captain first mate dynamic is it gives an absolute power dynamic. There is no point in arguing because he has the ultimate decision, and he will not listen openly when he is angry. Appealing to reason and his affection towards you are much more effective ways to get him to listen.","title":"The Beginner's Guide to Ending Arguments","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/4w83th\/the_beginners_guide_to_ending_arguments\/"}

It's a marriagemissions.com piece, so there are a couple about prayer, but obviously disregard them if it's not your thing. It's almost impossible to find quality advice for young married women in secular media, so I don't wan to alienate any of you guys with this, it really is a great list for a submissive wife. Good and basic, and refreshing to know there's an audience for the info on how to please a man according to what he wants. It's gently worded and applicable to all ages, not just newly married young women. \n\nThe hundred points here are good stuff. There are many points which talk about respecting his dignity and his reputation. NEVER slander your man, NEVER join in on all the husband bashing that wives love to engage in. I'm sure you've all seen and heard it, isn't it shocking? In his presence, behind his back, always build him up. One of the most important things you can do is just build him up. \n\nThey also have a few in here about keeping your body in shape and dressing in a way to attract his attention, but not skank it up in public. Dress in a way that makes him proud you're his wife. Being attractive, not being fat, and getting dressed in a way where you keep his eyes on you is #1. \n\nAnd several more were about giving him ample space and time alone. Of course he doesn't want to be smothered. But if you're with an alpha hottie it's hard not to want to be on top of him all the time. (Guilty.) His attention is valuable to you if he's a high value man. So yeah, give him a breather. \n\nNumber 98 is very cute, I'm going to do it this week. \n\n\nSo just a nice, basic list. What do you think?

The ways this can look are as varied as the women here and it is something that needs to be doled out via [incremental reciprocation](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/sc0f8l\/incremental_reciprocation_how_to_minimize_risk\/).\n\nThere is nothing more frustrating and heartbreaking for us OG RPW ladies as seeing women come in and write a post asking how the OP can submit harder, do more, be less upset , change her values, change her life...only to find out that she has been dating her man for three weeks. \n\nYou are still vetting at 3 weeks, at 3 months, at 6 months. You are still vetting when he asks you to be exclusive, or to be his girlfriend. You are still vetting when you move in together. You are still vetting until you have tied yourself to him for life. If you can *theoretically* pack a bag and leave tomorrow without divorce proceedings and child support payments, you are still vetting.\n\nVetting is what you do to determine if you can be with this man forever. And one important question to ask is \"**can I be with him and be content if he never changes from the man he is today\"**.\n\n* Does he have values that you find intolerable? Can you live with them forever *without changing your values*? \n\n* Does he work so much that it is impossible to plan dates? Can you live with nights alone or raising kids while he spends his weekends in the office? \n\n* Does he say things that hurt you? Are you ok living with that for the rest of your life? \n\n* Does he look at other women, escape into gaming, watch porn, drinks past good sense, abuse substances? Are you willing to have those behaviors in your life forever and can you be happy and not resentful? \n\nThis is a non-exhaustive list. It is just some of the topics that have come up over the years on this sub. \n\nIn the first 6 months at least, you should not be changing yourself for a man. You should be asking \"can I live with him if **he** never changes. And the bigger the issue, the longer into the relationship you should be asking the question. Things often seem acceptable at first and become tiresome over time. \n\nNow this is RPW so I am **not** suggesting that you are wonderful and perfect just the way you are. I am suggesting that you should not get into a relationship where you immediately have to change your behaviors\/values\/mindset to be with a man. If you have to do that, you aren't compatible. He can still be the most amazing man you have ever met but that doesn't mean he is the man for you. \n\n**Can you respect his behavior if it never changes? And can you do it without compromising yourself**\n\nGood luck and happy vetting!","title":"Vetting: *If he never changes*","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RedPillWomen\/comments\/1krzjci\/vetting_if_he_never_changes\/"}

Here's a handy checklist of things to ask yourself : \n\n- If someone said that they thought you and your partner had very similar personalities, would you take that as an insult?\n- When you met, did you think he was funny, and now you don't? \n- Does he try to calm things down, or does he escalate arguments? \n- Do you look forward to introducing him to people, or do you feel like he's going to say or do something stupid? \n- When he gives you advice, do you find yourself automatically assuming he's wrong? \n- Does he have financial stability, or does he squander his money? \n- Do you *feel* goofy and playful around him, or are you trying to force it? \n- Does he often refuse to accept evidence that contradicts something he said? Or does he try to have respectful discussions where he lets others say their piece without twisting their words? \n- Do you still find him attractive, or do you dislike the idea of having sex with him even when you're horny? \n\nIf you answered positively,  you probably just need to adjust your own behavior and that will fix things. However, if you answered negatively, you have lost internal respect. \nThe difference between acting disrespectful and losing internal respect is that disrespectful behavior doesn't effect how you really feel about him; you still like him as a person and enjoy spending time with him. When you lose internal respect, you find yourself having knee-jerk thoughts like \"oh great, the idiot is home\" and you find reasons to spend time away from him. Everything he does makes you roll your eyes. \n\nI understand that looking at a relationship with a critical lens is really hard, especially when your lives are tangled so tightly together. You want to do everything in your power to make it work, and you should. But you also need to know when youre not the problem. A lot of women like to blame men for things they dont do wrong, and so there isn't a lot of resources for understanding what a bad relationship actually looks like. \n\nI simply suggest trying to take a big step back and look at things through a very objective lens. Maybe it will look okay, but you should be open to realizing things you are trying to avoid.

But I'm still left hanging with this anxious feeling. I love how I look in make-up and feminine clothes, all made up for him but when I take it off and wear something comfortable, I immidiately feel ugly and unattractive. Then I think to myself how awful it must be for him to look at me without make-up and compare me to my \"better self\". \n\nIt is a very new feeling to me and I didn't think I would ever feel this way about myself.
