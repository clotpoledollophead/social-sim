{"author":"Historical-Ease-6311","body":"I think Blake Lively underwent sexual harassment but is being targeted by his smear campaign for not \"riding it out\" like Baldoni said, while suing her for $400 million.\n\nHis 300 pages of lawsuit reflect this.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s 7-minute long inappropriate voicemail sent at the inappropriate Timestamp of 2 am. I can never unhear these words from a male coworker to a female coworker at 2 am:\n\nJB: \"Hey Blake! It's 2 in the morning. Hopefully, this does not wake you up. \"\n\n\"I'm excited to spend time with you, to be in your presence, to share creative juices together.\"\n\n\"I love being in somebody's space. I feel like that's where I excel and definitely fall short at times.\"\n\n\"Our chemistry has been there right from the start. I felt it in the room when we met.\"\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to spending time together.\"\n\n\"There's nothing more exciting to me. I get to work with Blake Lively and have her - all of her - that's what I want. \"\n\n\"You're the secret sauce,\"\n\n\"You probably have kids all over you and a baby on your boob,\"\n\n\"It means the world to me that you trust me with your feelings.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to spend time with you,\"\n\nRemember the text messages from Baldoni's timeline:\n\nApril 5th 2023:\n'Just hired intimacy coordinator who I LOVE. Will set you up to meet\/FT with her next week for the intro.'\n\nApril 15th 2023:\n\nKhaleesi Texts and Baldoni\u2019s Hot and Bothered Creepy\/Sexual\/Sensual\/Seductive Voicemail\n\nApril 21st 2023:\n\n1) Baldoni meets intimacy coordinator for this PG-13 chic flick peppered with a couple of light DV scenes.\n\n2) Makes notes about his intimacy coordinator meeting and instead of discussing choreography and comfort level and guidance on existing intimate scenes from the movie script that was signed and agreed to by Blake, Baldoni proceeds to add gratuitous sex scenes, such as \"PULLING DOWN HER UNDERWEAR,\" \"GOING DOWN ON HER,\" \"PERFORMING A CLIT TEST ON HER V@G!NA\". Are you kidding me??????\n\nSo, in other words, right from April 5th, Baldoni has been imagining porn scenes with Blake Lively in his head, which explains his Hot and Bothered Creepy\/Sexual\/Sensual\/Seductive Voicemail on April 15th 2023.\n\nIt looks like unbeknownst to Blake that voicemail 1 month before filming began was the first day of her at the receiving end of his sexual harrassment.\n\nBaldoni forgot that sexual harassment is not just related to sexual behavior but also includes discriminating on the basis of sex. \n\nWhat are the chances Baldoni ever sent a creepy voice memo to any of the male actors in the last 2 years.\n\n*Heeeey, Brandon. It's 2 a.m. I get to be with Brandon. I want to share creative juices with you. You're the secret sauce. I want all of you, Brandon. You probably have a pillow on your boob and other pillows all over your body* in Baldoni's creepy, breathy, and heavily sexual voice. Maybe someone should use AI to make it.\n\nBlake had just opened up about how throughout her career she's had to write scripts by hand and not get credit, and his response was basically \"that's awful, I'd never do that to you!\" Fast forward to him claiming she and her \"dragons\" (Taylor & Ryan) were threatening him... except Taylor had to come out and say she doesn't even know who he is \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe most telling part is how he responded to her original concern - she said she was tired of getting vague praise instead of actual feedback, and what does he do? Leaves a 6-minute message full of vague romance-scam spiritual-scam punchlines, such as, \n\n\"I'm not perfect, \n\nI'll always fuck up, \n\nI'll apologize, \n\nand I'll return to center. I promise you.\"  \n\nNot a single piece of specific feedback in sight.\n\nAll it does is prove he completely understood Blake was talking about her past experiences with other filmmakers, not threatening him. Major self-own there for his lawsuit lying about him feeling threatened.\n\nThe guy knows he is inappropriate, and it's unsafe to work without keeping records that he can weaponize later. And that's exactly what he's done. Who leaves a 2 am. voice note about a baby on the boob of a coworker.\n\nAnd then records himself reading an extraordinarily performative 7 minute long creepy script for future public release, giving the same narcissistic vibes as his 30 minute long never-ending proposal video that was all about his greatness and nothing about his wife. The man can't help but violate boundaries. He's rapey and he knows it. \n\nWhen he first read the DV book \"It Ends with Us\" in 2019, he called it \"very sexy, very romantic, very mysterious\". Who refers to DV as a very sexy DV, a very romantic DV, and a very mysterious DV? \n\nBut somehow Blake Lively saying the movie is about \"Triumph\", so wear your \"Florals\" because Lily Bloom is the florist, is the bigger problem \ud83d\ude09","created_utc":1740865955000,"comment_id":"mffi4e1","parent_id":"t3_1j0wa7t","score":31,"submission_id":"1j0wa7t"}

I compared it to a study that also found wives gave their organs to their husbands at far higher rates then men.

They cannot function without women, and they cannot take responsibility for themselves. This starts in childhood and never stops, they need a wife to be their second mom. And now they ask feminists to fix their problems but in a way that doesn't hurt their fragile ego. They want us to stop using words like \"toxic masculinity\" because they lack the literacy to not take it personally. They cannot look at women voicing their hardships caused by patriarchal structures without taking it so personally they'd rather vote for a nazi.

{"author":"shootingstarstuff","body":"I\u2019ve never had children partly because I was afraid I could end up with a psychopath like my brother. The last time I think he (6\u20191) was violent with me (5\u20193, but shorter then) was around 1994 when I was 14 and he was 22. He was hungry, mom was at the stove finishing dinner, dad sitting at the table, brother standing around waiting, and I was setting the table. He decided I wasn\u2019t fast enough and struck me full force across the face. The blood vessels in my cheek are still visibly wonky from it, but improved after some laser treatments. I instinctively kicked out as it happened - something I would never normally do because any fighting back turns his casual sadism into frothing insanity. It probably left a bruise, but maybe not because he really never bruised from anything. I bolted and hid before he could keep at it. My mother came and found me. Forced me to come back, where they were all now seated around a partially set table, apologize for kicking back, finish setting the table, and sit while they ate. It feels cartoonishly representative of my whole family. It sounds made-up to me even though I lived it. I once brought it up a few years ago - my brother\u2019s violence was accepted and normalized - they only remember it as the time I kicked him back, and they still condemn me for it. They see it as that\u2019s a man\u2019s right and good women don\u2019t get in the way of what men want to do to us. I spent my childhood in flea market clothes, folding and putting away their tighty-whities, and cleaning their pubes off the bathroom floor. My brother was treated like a prince. It\u2019s the way of their world.\n\nAt about three years old I was taken aside for the first serious conversation of my life. It\u2019s always been my most vivid memory for some reason. My behavior had become unacceptable because of something to do with me running fast. They said I couldn\u2019t run faster than boys. I said I *could* and asked if my father wanted to race to see how fast I was. They explained that it didn\u2019t matter how fast I could run - that I was to never outrun a boy again, or win any games over them. That men and boys need to feel like men, and that women are not equal to men. In the idiocy of childhood I said, and I quote because I remember everything about this, \u201cwoman means \u2018WOAH MAN GET OUT OF MY WAY!\u2019\u201d And I thought I was so cute. To this day my parents have never looked more angry or disappointed than when I said that. Yeah, turns out, as it took me many years to understand, their religion is misogyny. And you practice that religion by centering your life around handicapping yourself to trick men into believing they\u2019re better than they really are and *certainly* better than you.","created_utc":1731040253000,"comment_id":"lvyjl0z","parent_id":"t3_1glvuxx","score":87,"submission_id":"1glvuxx"}

{"author":"WomenAreNotIntoMen","body":"I just want to clarify since the poster missed some nuanced, but women were allowed to open a bank account. \n\nThey are referencing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 which made (among other things) it illegal to discriminate against applicants based on sex and martial status. \n\nThe problem was many financial institutions didn\u2019t let women get credit claiming women would have a higher rate of non-payment. In particular married women had issues because men were by default the head of household and so because married people are often considered one entity they wanted the permission of the husband. \n\nIt would be like saying women were payed less then men in the US until 1963 when that was just the year it became illegal to engage in such practices.","created_utc":1747533729000,"comment_id":"mstubwk","parent_id":"t3_1komhyg","score":66,"submission_id":"1komhyg"}

{"author":"tiramisutra","body":"US women are still taxed together with their husband\/partner, meaning that the lower income is added to the larger income, making that earner financially dependent on the main bred winner. Most often, it\u2019s the woman\u2019s income that\u2019s added and, therefore, taxed higher. \n\nSweden abandoned this system in 1971, taxing each individual based on their own income and without respect to another earner. This meant that married women became financially independent. Women\u2019s right to support themselves was recognized and, as a result, a lot more women entered the workforce. Subsequently, access to child care became a right and, later in 2022, the \u201cmaxtaxa\u201d was introduced: there\u2019s a maximum charge for child care that cannot be exceeded. At present it\u2019s around $170 per month for the first child and lower for each additional child.\n\nSome say that US women don\u2019t want this type of system; they want to be able to stay at home and live off of one income. It\u2019s understandable as they have basically no parental leave. Also, child care is exceedingly expensive. Financial liberation has many steps but, of course, having one\u2019s own bank account may be one significant step in the right direction.","created_utc":1747609390000,"comment_id":"msypzal","parent_id":"t3_1komhyg","score":17,"submission_id":"1komhyg"}

{"author":"PrettyLittleBird","body":"Because men aren\u2019t great at expressing emotions or feelings, and publicly talking about loving your wife or needing her would be admitting a weakness. \n\nBecause men are taught that they have to be WINNERS and ALWAYS ON TOP, and if you\u2019re not a winner you\u2019re a LOSER. This mindset leaves traces everywhere, but where humor is concerned, it means lots of \u201cpunching down\u201d and putting others down with mean comments that are simultaneously how they really feel and also \u201cjust a joke, man\u201d depending on how the person they say them to reacts (which I\u2019ve heard others call \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Douchebag)\nThis is another consequence of not teaching men how to talk about their feelings or have healthy conflict management skills\u2026 when you\u2019re emotionally repressed and afraid of hard conversations, you eventually build up enough resentment to either start being passive aggressive and mean spirited to the people around you or having anger blowups. \n\nBecause our society makes divorce difficult, expensive, traumatic, shameful, and many consider divorce a failure. People stay in unhappy relationships and build resentment. \n\nBecause there is a negative connotation associated with being a doting husband, and they don\u2019t want the stigma of being whipped. \n\nBecause emotionally immature people frequently avoid things they don\u2019t want to do by blaming their spouse\u2026 because other emotionally immature people are pushy and whiny and demanding when told \u201cno\u201d. \nDon\u2019t want to go out with the guys tonight because you\u2019re having a hard time and just need a break? The person asking is pushy and you don\u2019t have the bandwidth today, and admitting you\u2019re emotionally drained is not MANLY and they\u2019ll definitely tell everyone else \u201cwe invited him but he needs to stay home and think about his FEELINGS\u201d? \nIt is SO MUCH EASIER just to say \u201coooh, man I would love to go to a bar and listen to an argument about Bitcoin but my wife said no, I need to, uh, move some heavy furniture.

Darn wife!\u201d\n\nBecause men who lived on their own for years and cleaned their own place frequently suddenly develop selective brain damage after moving in with a woman and forget how to clean or organize or shop for groceries or find the pickles in the fridge. Their partners are manipulated and gaslit into taking on the majority of the unpaid work and emotional labor in the household. \nSometimes the man knows how to clean, but doesn\u2019t want to, so they do everything wrong or halfway so they stop being asked, or they refuse to do any household work unless their wife specifically told them. \n\u201cof COURSE I don\u2019t want you to do all the work.

They're basically a vessel running scripts put in them by society, and instead of questioning that crap and getting rid of it and being themselves, empowering themselves and connecting to their actual values so they can start to have authentic connections from a centered place within, they double down on playing the abusive games of \"winning\" through deception and dishonesty. And then they wonder why their relationships fall apart and why women don't trust them and why they're so lonely.","created_utc":1736732834000,"comment_id":"m6rz9rs","parent_id":"t3_1hzcboz","score":78,"submission_id":"1hzcboz"}

I went all for that. Even though the razor bumps drove me nuts. \n\nNow I'm 33, my pits are hairy asf and I hardly ever shave my legs in the winter. But I gave up thinning my eyebrows as I always liked them thicker anyway. And I still rarely wear make up. I gave up straightening around 22. Way too much work and I was tired of it. I'm way more sensitive about my facial hair, but I'll let it go for a couple of days before I shave it. My own little fuck you to society. \n\n I'm a mom and my daughter is a gorgeous and hairy little thing. She's already been bullied by a neighbor girl (obviously a jealous little B word with a crap mom, sorry not sorry) and asked me about shaving. She's fucking 8. I'm doing my best to be body positive myself, even struggling with my own body dysmorphia, and point out that it's totally natural for us all to be hairy. I'll point to my own body hair and ask her if it makes me ugly. She's says no and I'm so beautiful and I say so is she.\n\n Hopefully that's enough, because I damn sure didn't have a supportive parent (quite the opposite actually) when I was younger and I really wish I had. But I know how much societal views can pressure us all into doing things we wouldn't naturally care about.\n\nWomen have hair.

None of them wore a hijab or similar at that time. The muslims were very progressive. Nowadays, I see really young girls wearing hijab and other coverings in a very conservative way. It makes me sad that there happened to be such a big step backward. In my opinion, if a grown woman decides to cover her hair - ok. But those young girls don't look like they had a choice. Deep down in my heart, I understand that it's patriarchy. I even googled the history of hijab and similar. I found some information. One of it was that the Koran recommended to cover up the chest area because the garmments they wore back then were very wide.

In addition to the hijab being blatantly sexist, there are verses in the Hadith saying that women walk in the shape of the devil, and finding a woman sexy means the devil is tempting you.\n\n\nNot only that, there are verses saying that a prayer doesn't count if a black dog, donkey and woman walk in front of you. Yes, you read that right. I feel the most hurtful thing about this is that any other kind of dog is fine but women aren't. Also, when men shake hands with a woman they're not related to, they have to clean their whole body afterwards.\u00a0\n\n\nI figured I'd mention a few lesser known things about women in Islam, because eveyone knows about the wife-beating, women not being allowed to go out without a man, and Muhammad's \"women are defficient in intelligence\" speech.\n\n\nMuhammad was a deeply disturbed individual.

Resident, who would normally be well within his rights under castle doctrine, wakes up, grabs his gun, and opens fire.  Police return fire, hitting Breonna 8 times (out of 20), killing her.  A woman is now dead and to add insult to injury the man trying to defend hearth and home is charged with assault on a police officer.\n\nLet\u2019s say no gunfire happened and they entered the house, said oops, and left.  They would not even be accountable for the door, doorframe, or anything burned\/damaged by flash bangs or gas thrown in ahead of them.\n\nThis \u201cqualified immunity\u201d is bullshit.

You become important to her. You are no longer some random insignificant face in the crowd.!<\n\n>!I know it is kind of low-level behaviour. But I do enjoy doing that. I go to another city, look for a girl that is walking by herself and start following her. After a while they notice you.

At like 11, the tennis coach I'd been getting lessons from for years told my parents I couldn't come for another lesson unless they got me a sports bra despite the fact that I really didn't have anything going on up there at all - literally the smallest training bra we could find was still baggy and looked really lumpy and weird under my clothes.  So bonus points for feeling both freakish for being held out of practice like that but also too small to need a bra yet as we were repeatedly told by saleswomen.\n\nAnd those are just examples of how the adults made things weird.  I'm not sure if it's society that stops being so damn awkward towards you once you finish puberty or if you've just learned how to navigate it better by then, but growing up can suck when you're a girl.","created_utc":1623190857000,"comment_id":"h1151rx","parent_id":"t3_nv21ue","score":34,"submission_id":"nv21ue"}

Well before puberty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit for the comment removed that asked if I could relate.\n\nNo I cannot. For some folks developing feminine features is a valuable social aspect (yes messed up in many ways but it is what it is). I was always treated as \"feminine\" so in no way do I ever remember being genderless. I have biracial boys who look like whatever boogie man you want them to be and my greatest fear is the day that they loose the status of \"child\" and are seen as -insert whatever race here- men. So I can't even relate to the feminine side of this with my own children whose genders are very ambiguous (they have long hair) only the masculine fears.\n\nAs a teenager I liked having breasts, wearing my gothtastic make-up, and being feminine. As a Black teenager I never wanted to be a boy. Better to be a girl and avoid getting my ass whooped more because I was a boy. Better to be sexualized than murdered. I want to note that in no way do I consider these feelings that I had \"okay\" but they were none the less my feelings and recognizing them as problematic is a way to grow.\n\nI once had a small but important row with my professor\/mentor over developing pubertal features and their impact on girls and boys. They said that \"For boys developing masculine features is a positive social aspect\" I argued that for white boys it's positive for Black boys it's dangerous to be viewed as an \"adult\". We also spoke a lot about the increase in anorexia and bulimia in Black and Latinx youth, specifically in women and how it is a very recent trend for thin body dysmorphia (whereas White women always have had a long history of the ideal body type being thin).\n\nSo for one group developing may be a \"positive\" social thing for women (again, this is not to say that the reason for that positivity aren't steeped in sexism and oversexualization) and for other groups thin might be in vogue.\n\nAs with many things involving feminism the intersection between culture\/race\/gender could be playing a very important role in whether people are able to relate to this.","created_utc":1623188719000,"comment_id":"h11077a","parent_id":"t3_nv21ue","score":76,"submission_id":"nv21ue"}

So, when the vibrator was suggested, I felt like I was being told I wasn\u2019t \u2018man enough\u2019 to please her. Obviously, it\u2019s not a healthy mindset (which I\u2019m working through), but it really got to me.

(I think this sub is welcoming to trans women; if not, I guess I\u2019ve dug my own grave with this comment)\n\n**TL;DR:** Toxic masculinity is a hell of a drug.

{"author":"prettylittledistance","body":"The problem with \u201cchoice feminism\u201d is that it presents these two options as if women can choose freely between them, when in reality there is a cultural stigma against women with body hair that drives most women to shave. Women are perceived as less hygienic and less desirable just for leaving their body hair as-is. Shouldn\u2019t we ask why the woman on the right feels \u201cmore comfortable\u201d shaving? Sure, some people have unruly\/itchy body hair, but it\u2019s far more likely that she\u2019s more comfortable in a shaved body because of the social pressure to do so. In my own experience, not shaving often comes at the consequence of feeling uncomfortable around others because of how your body hair might be perceived. Feminism can\u2019t be as simple as \u201cyou do you\u201d when we\u2019re examining issues that are directly connected to women\u2019s oppression. Any woman should be able to choose what she does with her body hair, but we can\u2019t pretend that either choice is of equal weight in our current society.

{"author":"Winter_Asleep","body":"I apologise if this turns into a rant.\n\nI'm in the UK and we have had a murder committed in Clapham in London, where a woman was abducted off the street and murdered by a Met policeman.  Since that discovery, online discussion on Twitter has been Notallmen, TooManymen and lots of women shared their experiences of harassment, violence and fear.\n\nSarah Everard did everything \"right,\" in that she was walking along a well lit street, with her mobile, letting her family know when she'd be back, like we all have to do.  And of course, you get the usual comments of \"what was she doing out at that time,\" etc.  This  follows on from a YouGov survey in which 97% of women stated that they had been sexually harassed in the workplace.\n\nI can't be the only one who's just so tired.  I'd (foolishly) thought that, with the MeToo movement and discussion about women's experiences, that there would be more awareness.  Instead, the advice given to women whilst the investigation was going on was exactly the same as when the Yorkshire Ripper was committing his crimes, that woman should not go out alone.  This, due to the Covid restrictions stating that only one person per household can go out, effectively meant that women couldn't out at all.\n\nI'm tired.  Tired of having to carry a small bottle of perfume in my bag, because pepper spray isn't legal. Tired of having to carry my keys in my hand like a budget Wolverine.  Tired of worrying about my daughters whenever they are out anywhere.  The catcalls and invitations for sex have stopped since I've gotten older but being asked if I want to fuck whilst nipping to shop wasn't needed - luckily for me he was on a second floor flat and not on ground level, so I didn't have to run.\n\nEvery woman I've spoken to has a story of fear, of harassment and of not been taken seriously when these issues are discussed.  I've lost count of the men who seem non-plussed when you mention it.  The depressing thing is that I can't see this getting any better.  I live in the North in England.  In winter, we get six hours of daylight, which means you go to work in the dark and come home in the dark.  Are women supposed to hibernate during this time?\n\nIt's exhausting and frustrating all at the same time.  I'm sure every decent police officer was furious about the fact that it was a MET officer who had been charged with this, because the question now will be, if we can't trust the police, who can we trust?  The authorities lost the trust of people of colour a long time ago.  Does 52% of the population have to be on their guard against them as well? \n\nSorry that this was such a long post.","created_utc":1615500657000,"comment_id":"gqko3xa","parent_id":"t3_m2ocb5","score":89,"submission_id":"m2ocb5"}

Gross. Now some brave women themselves have started movements to tackle that problem and protect each other. Statistics are wild - so many young girls experience chikan assaults (act and being posted online) during their childhood that it\u2019s not even rare anymore. It\u2019s so widespread and popular in east asia that they have special brothels themed like metro cars where SWs dress like schoolgirls plus there are chikan \u201cinfluencers\u201d aka perps that post a lot of content assaulting women and girls in public transportation. One popular chikan website was literally funded by a member of a very famous boy band.\n\n\nAnother thing I always found crazy about Japan is that women are blamed if marriage ends in divorce because they are responsible for \u201cdomestic harmony\u201d.. even if they work FT they need to take care of their house, kids and man like they are paid maids. Obviously this dynamic is common around the world but in Japan the woman cannot even complain because she needs to make sure that when he arrives, he can relax in silence like he is visiting a spa where everyone caters to his needs. Even kids have to treat their dad like he is a royal and not make noise. Divorce brings shame to woman\u2019s family so their parents usually won\u2019t offer any objective advice and it might be difficult to find a new partner because of the \u201cshame of being a divorcee\u201d whilst divorced men don\u2019t share any of that shame burden. \n\nAlso, since being emotionally open is not common and mental health issues are a taboo subject then people won\u2019t get appropriate help on time and it can lead to violence. Basically women suffering (domestic) abuse are left more alone and isolated because of shame + victim blaming than in most other parts of the world. \n\n(I am not Japanese nor Asian, just my observations over the years).","created_utc":1747026529000,"comment_id":"mrt7e8n","parent_id":"t3_1kk1l5a","score":303,"submission_id":"1kk1l5a"}

{"author":"bananapineapplesauce","body":"Standing with you. I lived in \u9759\u5ca1\u770c and felt a lot of empathy for what Japanese women face. \n\nOne of the saddest aspects for me was the hive-mind aspect that discouraged independent thought. My Japanese lady friends were always like, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married? You need to get married.\u201d I\u2019d usually make polite excuses about not finding the right guy yet, but finally after a particularly harsh session of being told I need a husband, I finally snapped and said, still smiling and genki, \u201cWhy? Men are horrible. Every married woman I know is secretly miserable.\u201d\n\nAnd the looks on their faces were heartbreaking. I could see that they all agreed, but were stunned to hear someone say it out loud. No one spoke. No one even tried to object. They just sadly nodded and changed the subject. And they never asked me or spoke about it again. \n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking that women have been so well-programmed to accept ideas that can be actively harmful (e.g. women must be married, women should be treated as less capable, as servants to their male counterparts, etc.)\n\nI think being silenced is one of the most insidious, under-acknowledged forms of gender-related harm women face. \n\n\u51fa\u308b\u676d\u306f\u6253\u305f\u308c\u308b is used like a weapon, and collective societal shame is also like a weapon. (The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.)\n\nKeep fighting the good fight, OP. I think more people are realizing that behind all the smiling faces in Japan, there is a lot of pain, but I think Japan needs more external pressure from \u5916\u56fd, which means the rest of the world needs to hear more stories from women about what it\u2019s really like there. \n\nThank you for speaking up.","created_utc":1747030434000,"comment_id":"mrtisf2","parent_id":"t3_1kk1l5a","score":380,"submission_id":"1kk1l5a"}

Neither the embryo nor the fetus can be aware - and, therefore, experience - pain. A woman who decides to have an abortion does not hurt anyone but herself. From 40 to 60% of the embryos are not able to develop due to genetic errors, therefore, they are subjected to \"natural\" abortion. Medical abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy is a procedure that is the \u201cdirect successor\u201d of biological processes that are already going on in a woman\u2019s body.","created_utc":1643508273000,"comment_id":"huqv9g3","parent_id":"t3_phrcrn","score":30,"submission_id":"phrcrn"}

{"author":"Mad_Aeric","body":"I don't care for the implication that not understanding is a man thing. I see it as an empathy thing. Hear me out on this for a moment.\n\nThere's all sorts of things that separate people out, language, culture, economic status, age, and yes, gender. The less capacity for empathy people have, the more like them someone has to be to be related to. Conversely, people with more empathy have an easier time crossing those barriers and seeing things from other perspectives.\n\nBringing it back to the subject at hand, you'll generally find that the sorts of men who can't or won't consider the circumstances that lead to abortion from a woman's perspective are also the ones who also most isolate themselves to associating with people like themselves. For women, that empathy barrier is lower because they don't have to cross the gender line. Thus, you'll find an increased number of pro-choice women even among those that never expect to find themselves needing such services, and among anti-choice demographics.\n\nOf course, this is just a personal theory.","created_utc":1603511785000,"comment_id":"g9si9p8","parent_id":"t3_jgm7wk","score":6,"submission_id":"jgm7wk"}

{"author":"ASpyintheHouseofLove","body":"Worked in nursing homes. Plenty of unbothered wives when they lost their husbands. They\u2019d tell of trying to leave, but no DV shelters and no ability to rent, buy, and refused work. The kids would swear mom\/grandma would never leave, they had the perfect relationship. Families often don\u2019t hear the truth because they can\u2019t or don\u2019t develop a peer relationship with the women in their lives. \n\nI heard stories of straight up war crimes. STIs constantly brought home, years of rage inducing levels of weaponized incompetence, beatings, drinking away rent money, hurting the kids and\/or animals. The control by pregnancy. Losing themselves to the constant caregiving. Women have carried whole generations on their backs and dragged these losers along, too. \n\nYoung women today don\u2019t know the horrors that exist in the family lineage. Young women are taking advantage of the work done and going further, but I worry when they\u2019re too cavalier. Hold the line and fight for the rights of future women. Can\u2019t forget these men will kneecap you. Drag you down. Waste your youth, beauty, skill. Circumvent societies relaxed rules and use it to never marry you, or pay child support, they\u2019ll say they don\u2019t owe you anything, but certainly benefit from your labor.\n\nNow they can keep you pregnant in some states and they never have to marry you. You get no protections. Less than generations past. Be wary. Be wise.\n\nAll that to say, when I saw my ex being like the warnings finally. Finally! I left. Those ladies were warning me. They knew. I\u2019d said enough in our conversations.\n\nLeaving is the most dangerous time. He entered a friend\u2019s residence months after I left him with the intent of hurting me. He had my son for a visit at the time, he wasn\u2019t with him, of course. I\u2019ll never know fully how violent he intended to get because I wasn\u2019t alone. He came in screaming, made it to the room I was in. He was confronted and physically held by three other people. The whole next two days were a cluster, but have stayed with me for years. \n\nMy ex didn\u2019t believe in marriage. Pays as little as possible in child support (when he pays it) and he never follows the generous parenting plan. It was all a scheme to lower child support. Dude is a capital L loser and you know what? They all use the same playbook. Why does he do that? by Lundy Bancroft makes this clear.","created_utc":1752008525000,"comment_id":"n1z91m2","parent_id":"t3_1lueylb","score":85,"submission_id":"1lueylb"}

{"author":"sylbug","body":"For anyone who is wondering - it\u2019s crucial to teach children healthy boundaries starting at a young age in order for them to form healthy adult relationships. One of the first steps in this process is teaching bodily autonomy - that no other person has the right to touch their body if they don\u2019t want, and that they do not have the right to touch other people\u2019s bodies if those people don\u2019t want to.\n\nThis starts simple, with things like hugs, and teaches the basic understanding that a persons body is their own, and they have the absolute right to not get in the car with their drunk friend, they don\u2019t have to take part in hazing, they don\u2019t have to kiss that person just because he bought dinner.\n\nTeaching bodily autonomy early have some distinct advantages. It builds confidence and clearly signals to the child against that physical and sexual abuse is not okay.  In adult relationships, it can prevent them from being both aggressors and victims to sexual assault.","created_utc":1620963843000,"comment_id":"gy0ljq0","parent_id":"t3_nbfv6s","score":10,"submission_id":"nbfv6s"}

They quote how the total of all murdered men outnumber women and say 'see, men have it worse ', not caring those figures include accidental drive by shootings, gang related killings, etc. They quote a story of how a man was assaulted by women and call us mysandrists. But they ignore the total of murders, rapes and sexual assaults on women, done  just because they are women. Most sex crimes on men are performed by men. Most murders of men are done by men. Most crimes on women are by men. \n\nBut they'll sit there and shrug it off snd laugh when their friends catchall a woman, try to coerce a 9 year old to talk to them and tell them 'you have nice tits', and think because they didn't do it, they're good men.  They'll ignore a woman when she says no to a drink, a date, to sex, and think if they hound her, they're being romantic. They'll see how a woman can say no over and over, and know that one no from a man equals more than 100 nonsense from a woman,  but still sit there as another man harrasses a her. Over and over we've seen men drug a woman's drink and try to take her out of the bar- with other men watching- but it takes a woman, the gender that abusive men target, gaslight and ignore, to save the woman about to be kidnapped and assaulted.\n\nAnd then, when a woman comes home fed up after another man mistreating them because they are a woman,  and they cry 'God, I hate men!', everyone now attacks her for being sexist.","created_utc":1685426456000,"comment_id":"jm4hu20","parent_id":"t3_13v1r5v","score":231,"submission_id":"13v1r5v"}

{"author":"Celany","body":"So I run a Burning Man theme camp. One year, after we left for the year, I found out that several of our women campers had been harassed by two new campmates. Now one of the guys was clearly an actual predator who fully knew what he was doing. Fuck that guy.\n\nThe other guy was a slightly more interesting case. When they were both banned from the camp, he responded with a very angry message to me about how maybe he wouldn't have wanted to come back to the camp anyways, because people were so mean to him. Out of curiosity, I asked what he meant (I didn't believe for a second that any of our camp members were mean, but I wanted to see what was \"mean\" to him). Well, several of the camp members who complained about him harassing them flat-out told him that they didn't want to talk to them, and to leave them alone. When he continued to talk to them, they told him to fuck off and go away. They said similar things to  \"Are you stupid or do you just don't care that I want to talk to you?\" as he kept pushing. He, however, was totally convinced that they saying \"I don't want to talk to you, go away\" was them \"joking\" with him. \n\nMy response to him was: \"These women told you that they didn't want to talk to you and yet you persisted. So they've literally TOLD YOU IN PLAIN ENGLISH that they do not want to talk to you, and you're surprised that when you kept talking to them they told you to fuck off? What exactly do you expect to happen when you keep pushing your company on someone who doesn't want it? Why would you think that someone is joking who says that. AND even if you think they are, if they start to say outright mean things to you, doesn't that sound like a solid indication of them NOT joking and ACTUALLY wanting you to fuck off? \n\nHis response back to me was astonishing: He had never actually considered that they might be serious when they said they didn't want to talk to him. He hadn't thought that maybe they would be mean as a result of not wanting to talk to him and him pushing. He actually sounded like this was a major life revelation for him as he made some kind of comment about how it put so many other interactions with a woman into context for him.\n\nI ended up responding and basically said \"If the idea that women don't want to talk to you is something that you didn't understand before today, I would strongly suggest that you get therapy. Not being mean, it's just a real problem on your part that you believe that half of the population is entitled at all times to have a conversation with you. That is the kind of thing that is going to require the help of a specialist to unlearn, and if you have any kind of commitment to being the kind, interesting, cool person that I thought I had gotten to know, then you MUST do the work to fix this\".\n\nHe said he was going to look into it, and we haven't spoken since. I often wonder if any of that was sincere, and if he looked into it. \n\nEither way, though I have met and dealt with many, MANY entitled men in my life, this is the first time that I've had it be revelation to one that women don't have to talk to them. Normally, they seem to be aware of it and just don't care.","created_utc":1627181265000,"comment_id":"h6e5g80","parent_id":"t3_oqoj1p","score":95,"submission_id":"oqoj1p"}

{"author":"Marton_Sahhar","body":"Ultimately, sex should not be a metric on which to measure one's personality. You could be a promiscuous angel or a chaste asshole. Indeed, I think that women are gauged on their sexuality because society sexualised women anyway. You don't see a close up of a man's bulge in underwear adverts but you do see every square inch of skin exposed on a woman. So when society, catalyzed by media and avert campaigns turn women into something similar to a sexy mannequin with a heartbeat, then it's no wonder that the rest of society cannot see past that. The fact that we throw the rest of a woman's personality out of the window because we're measuring by *sluttyrating* is incredibly dehumanizing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kids bit is different IMO, it's almost not even related to sex.

A similar strategy is utilized by advertizers of food products targeted at children: Fun= brand of fast food. Celebrate = brand of food or drink. Why chapagne? Why diamonds? Why a white dress modeled after a european royal wedding? Seems harmless. Its not when culture is framed for you, and tells you your place. Usurps your emotional assosiations before you know you have made them. When it comes from a culture of oppression, its anything but harmless. *How do you think racism and sexism is perpetuated??*  It is disguised as culture; defended as identity.","created_utc":1622073528000,"comment_id":"gzj0b43","parent_id":"t3_nl7ruo","score":19,"submission_id":"nl7ruo"}

{"author":"coldgreenrapunzel","body":"My thoughts are that the long lasting committed relationship tends to benefit men and harms women - and marriage laws do at least a little to try and protect women in terms of splitting assets etc. Women often do the same amount of physical and mental labour with or without marriage after all. Culturally I think it\u2019s accurate to frame it as women wanting marriage - to put a ring on it, to be legally recognised as a partner - and that men resent it - because marriage means they have legal obligations and can\u2019t theoretically leave their wife high and dry. \n\nE.g my grandparents knew multiple folk songs about women who were promised marriage and then stigmatised for having sex outside of marriage after the man then refuses to marry - women needed to be married to have unstigmatised sex and men didn\u2019t need it.\n\nI don\u2019t think this has changed as much as it should. Certainly there\u2019s much less stigma but  e.g today a woman may become a SAHM and be left with very little if she separates from her abusive partner if they weren\u2019t married, despite supporting their career. In my country at least it really affects entitlement to assets, pension, inheritance etc. I don\u2019t necessarily think it *should* and that all forms of long term relationships should be addressed properly, but marriage is an important protection for women in the courts in my country. \n\nHowever it\u2019s tricky as some partners may treat marriage as a sign they\u2019ve permanently \u201cwon\u201d a partner and use it as an opportunity to become more abusive, and I dislike the many symbols in various cultures that suggest marriage involves women as property transactions. But I do think in my country at least, marriage is often being replaced by long term unrecognised partnerships with little benefits, and I\u2019d rather invent a \u201cnotification of long term partnership\u201d form to give someone access to particular legal financial and healthcare rights and do away with all the cultural and religious connotations of marriage, which can be an optional alternative ceremony.","created_utc":1713129741000,"comment_id":"kzj1uh5","parent_id":"t3_1c3mdre","score":100,"submission_id":"1c3mdre"}

I think it's a great thing.\nIf you want to be called miss it's okay, but you should have the right to be called Mrs if you want, especially in formal places like workplace and such.\n\nIn my favorite podcast which is a podcast that gathers testimonies from women who had small or big victories against sexism, a woman once told how she took power in a work conversation by telling a rude man who was calling her miss \"Moi c'est Madame\", meaning \"Call me Mrs\", and at this moment the conversation shifted, she felt much more empowered and she managed to end the conversation in her favor, and her sentence became kind of a slogan in the podcast, I think they even named their feminist boardgame \"moi c'est madame\".

{"author":"toriemm","body":"Being decent is the absolute minimum. For sure. \n\nI had a talk with my partner the other night about walking our friends dog. He didn't even set to leave til 730\/8 when it's already dark outside. That devolved into talking to him about how I would never be able to do that comfortably, and how we tell women not to be victims, rather than teach men not to be predators. \n\nTo that end, our society is so deeply entrenched in paitriarchy, it will be a big uphill battle to bring things to any sort of level between genders. I mean, our last names are a link to our forefathers. A number of the major religions are paitriarical. Our language is gendered and women's bodily autonomy is up for discussion on legislation. \n\nBut we have systemic problems that can be addressed. Comprehensive sex education before kids are even hitting puberty- making the information about sexual assault (male and female), LGBTQ+, consent and sexual intercourse part of the conversation when kids are young enough to not have firm world views on things. Before kids are swapping myths and misinformation with their friends, that end looking like a fraternity party with a passed out girl passed around like the chip bowl. I love my SO dearly, but he had no idea about some things (thank you NV education) like, he didn't have to get tested because he didn't have any symptoms, or that he could tell how many men I had sex with by looking at my labia. r\/badwomensanatomy is full of armchair gynos with a crusty misogynist film. I learned things about my own sex organs when I put in a diva cup for the first time. Demystifying our own bodies would be real helpful in how our society thinks about sex. (And debunking the 'virgin' stigma. Ain't no girl being sullied by a fumbly 17yo boys touch, and no boys are being made men by getting some)\n\n https:\/\/imgur.com\/i2GlBES.jpg\n\nAnd the culture of toxic masculinity. There's a doc, The Masks We Wear, that gets into where TM comes from and how it effects boys. I'm lucky enough to be with a man who talks to me and feels feelings, but I feel like men like him are the minority state. We teach our men that might is right, and to be masculine is to be aggressive and confident and in no way feminine at all. Strong, ambitious women are 'tomboys' but sweet, sensitive, nurturing men are 'sissies' or 'gay' or 'pussies'. We teach our men that they can only be warriors- competitive, conquerors, merciless, regardless of the type of work they do. So they feel entitled to break the rules of decency when it comes to 'being a man'. Too many men view themselves as women's opposition- 'losing' the divorce, being 'chained up' in marriage, being 'owed' sex for basic decency, 'tearing her up' when discussing sexual performance, refusing to compete with or hit women- it festers into this red pill frustration that leads to turning women into victims or fembots to be preyed upon and punished. \n\nSo yes, being decent isn't difficult, but we need to make some baseline changes to help everyone out.","created_utc":1613712784000,"comment_id":"gnxn2j6","parent_id":"t3_lmlxk9","score":6,"submission_id":"lmlxk9"}

{"author":"Inkedbrush","body":"I would change two words in her comment: Sex is seen as a necessary need that must be done TO the wife BY the husband at any time. \n\nA big part of purity culture is women being shamed for enjoying sex and being raised to believe that wanting sex was inherently immoral. That\u2019s why the romantic comedies of the 80\/90s relied on the women being pursed and on the men pursuing. Purity culture was still predominate and women could not be seen as enjoying a man\u2019s advances because it made her \u201cimmoral\u201d or a \u201cslut\u201d so she had to be against the romantic elements. This is often shown by having a female character who enjoys her sexuality as a side character, but almost never the main character. \n\nSame thing with romance books from that time. Women didn\u2019t verbally consent in them because the consent was implicit in her physical response because if the FMC mentally expressed sexual want she no longer had the upper moral ground to the reader. \n\nThis is never a problem for men. They are lauded for being sexual, and often is understood to be a basic need for men their sexual need and enjoyment is up front and center. But they pick women for sex as either objects for fun or breeding material. Women who enjoy sex are for fun. Women who are cautious and uncomfortable with their sexuality are marriageable with the implication that women who enjoy sex are more likely to cheat. Yet, marrying women who are uncomfortable with their sexuality and don\u2019t have sex at the frequency their husband requests are often used as a scapegoat for men\u2019s infidelity. Purity culture puts sex as something done TO women BY men, not something women do for men.","created_utc":1682629309000,"comment_id":"jhwx903","parent_id":"t3_130dolv","score":148,"submission_id":"130dolv"}

{"author":"Latter_Lab_4556","body":"Two sides of the same coin. The coin is: women's bodies are inherently sexual and serve a sexual purpose. The dilemma is: should women be flaunting their sexual value, or should they not be flaunting their sexual value?\n\nAs feminists, you have to ask yourself if doing so progresses or hinders the advancement of women. Ultimately, denying women the right to do what they want to with their bodies is incredibly problematic, a woman selling her body is little different than a man selling his body in a physically demanding job. However, no one should have to sell their body to survive. A person shouldn't need to start an onlyfans, or work a job that will break them before they are forty just to survive in today's world. We are no longer an agrarian society, we shouldn't be working the fields and dying at the ripe old age of fifty because the sun damaged our skin and the fields broke our backs, or because people view the value of women stemming from their bodies.\n\nDo not become a reactionary against sex because it is often something men do to women, or something women do to please men. Sex should be liberated from pleasing patriarchal demands for women and for men. Those who participate in sex work or enjoy having sex should not be shamed for drinking out of a well poisoned by patriarchal views, the well needs to be purified or it needs to be dug in a spot with better water.","created_utc":1682669507000,"comment_id":"jhzn8ls","parent_id":"t3_130dolv","score":20,"submission_id":"130dolv"}

{"author":"Aethelia","body":"It should be specified that this was asked in South Korea.\n\nSomeone else could explain the full situation better, I just know that feminism has been successful recently in South Korea. Abortion has been decriminalized, martial rape is now illegal, more women are educated than ever before, and they are succeeding in jobs that women would have never been seen doing 30 years ago.\n\nWith this success, there has been backlash. Misogynist\/insecure men blame feminism for their problems. Recently, this has been weaponized politically. The conservative party has been targeting young men, telling them feminism is to blame for their economic problems, especially unemployment and not being able to afford housing. Much like American conservatives, they don't offer any solutions, but they do offer a target for men's anger. The intent is to sway the vote for the presidential election coming up next March. Unfortunately, there are indications that manipulating young male anger against women is likely to work. This poll about dating is just a side-effect of that campaign.","created_utc":1626404775000,"comment_id":"h5b4mcl","parent_id":"t3_okrai8","score":29,"submission_id":"okrai8"}

{"author":"BlueButterflies139","body":"I don't think people understand that the Barbie movie is PURPOSELY feminism 101 and is not meant to be some deep cut dissection of feminism. It's feminism 101 because most women, especially older women, haven't been exposed to any level of real feminism in their lives.\n\nBarbie Land is a simplified gender swapped version of our society because:\n\n1. It's about Barbie dolls, not people. That removes a whole layer of sex and child care that are central aspects of women's oppression in the real world.\n\n2. if they made it a realistic flip where the Ken's had no rights, no autonomy, and where used as domestic labor, the movie would have been called insane and unrealistic.\n\nEdit: A lot of people have a problem with me saying that older women haven't had much exposure to feminism. While it is true that older women were the starting point and backbone of the feminist movement, those women were very small portion of women over all. The majority were still living lives where men controlled them, and they had minimal rights or autonomy. As a reminder, it's only been 50 years since women were allowed to open a bank account in the US, and in more than 50 other countries women still can't open their own bank accounts.","created_utc":1727086461000,"comment_id":"logr30r","parent_id":"t3_1fmww5h","score":451,"submission_id":"1fmww5h"}

All the \u201cAllens\u201d left because they couldn\u2019t take it. \n\nSociety was build on the rule of Barbie. The movie has some complexity, in that it\u2019s telling multiple stories at once, but at the same time, it\u2019s also trying to keep it light, so the concepts get a little thin at points and the plight of the Kens isn\u2019t always a true mirror to the plight of real women. It\u2019s a Martell backed movie, so Barbie is still the central character and Stereotypical Barbie is telling her story. \n\nThe real women are telling their story, and Ken is kind of a stand in for showing the concept of gender-led society and how its very existence is limiting. \n\nKen sings about is he cursed to live a life of \u201cblonde fragility\u201d and is he \u201cnot hot when he\u2019s in his feelings,\u201d and he ascribes these feelings to the fact that Barbie doesn\u2019t like him. Barbie doesn\u2019t like him, so that must be why he feels empty inside, because that\u2019s what his society tells him - your value is based on how much Barbie likes you. If Barbie doesn\u2019t want to play with you, you disappear as if you don\u2019t exist. \n\nKen is very much oppressed, but in the beginning of the movie, he only knows that he feels bad and his world doesn\u2019t give him the tools to try and understand why. \n\nAt the end of the movie, the Ken\u2019s status is elevated because the Barbies agrees to give Kens some power, and they ask if they could please have just one Supreme Court seat\u2026and President Barbie tells them no, but then enthusiastically says,    \u201cBut maybe a lower circuit court\u201d and the Kens are very happy with this\u2026because they don\u2019t know any better.","created_utc":1727093336000,"comment_id":"loh6sqt","parent_id":"t3_1fmww5h","score":75,"submission_id":"1fmww5h"}

If you don\u2019t develop an income stream, and your husband dies or leaves you for a younger woman as is commonly the case, it will be too late to start a career. Unless you\u2019re independently wealthy, relying upon a relationship that\u2019s based on love and sex leaves you vulnerable.\n\nPerhaps we can take a page from the Mosuo people who live in the truly traditional way, in the large maternal family house. They tried the marriage thing under pressure from the Chinese, and hated it. In their system, there\u2019s no reason to fight. There\u2019s no reason to have obligatory sex. They only have sex when they feel like it, as nature intended. If a couple doesn\u2019t feel like having sex, or they don\u2019t get along, they simply part ways.

Getting out of that relationship took a lot of courage and took me actually GROWING UP to tell this jackass to leave me the fuck alone once and for all.

{"author":"favmyheart","body":"I already commented this on another sub, but: When I was in high school, I didn't date anyone because I felt that I wasn't ready. However, a friend of mine got a lot of attention from much older guys that she met online (WoW, LoL etc). She talked to some of them and this lead to her dating a 20 year old when she was just THIRTEEN. It was truly sickening because they started having sex so soon, and she was introduced into the BDSM community by this boyfriend. I didn't realise how horrifying this truly was until I grew up, but I always felt like that wasn't okay at all. My friend felt really cool about dating a guy, she felt so mature and validated. She started talking a LOT more about sex to us (most girls hadn't even had their first kiss), stating that she was a sub, that she loved anal and BDSM in general. One day she showed us bruises and scratches, we flipped out and she started defending herself... The guy turned out to be emotionally abusive and she still has some trauma over that relationship.\n\nThis was truly horrifying and the worst thing is that somehow, society normalizes dating much younger women. What my friend lived is not a unique experience, I know more women that have dealt with the same thing. It is normalized because women are \"more mature\" and it is frowned upon to see age disparities as weird because it is shallow. \"Age is just a number\", \"age doesn't reflect maturity\" and so on and so forth. Sadly, men who date teenagers look for control in their relationship, and this leads to some fucked up consequences...","created_utc":1563582532000,"comment_id":"eu8bf9r","parent_id":"t3_cf7va7","score":100,"submission_id":"cf7va7"}

So I\u2019m even more unsure about getting married to a man in the future than I am marrying a woman.\n\nIdk, I might just stay single.

The institutions of control include law, marriage, prostitution, pornography, health care, the economy, organized religion, and systematized physical aggression against women (for instance, in rape and battery). Male domination of the female body is the basic material reality of women\u2019s lives; and all struggle for dignity and self-determination is rooted in the struggle for actual control of one\u2019s own body, especially control over physical access to one\u2019s own body.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm glad to see that anti marriage posts are being appreciated.","created_utc":1610404750000,"comment_id":"givv5sz","parent_id":"t3_kv1kop","score":16,"submission_id":"kv1kop"}

These feminists aren't following the definition, equality for all, not only women. Didn't some lady already face this, she said she wasn't a feminist and everyone started hating her!! This  quote takes away the meaning of sexism, discriminating against ANY GENDER!!! If a radical feminist says kill all men, then that is sexism. If a MRA or even any man says kill all women or women are trash then he also is sexist. But often feminists who say kill all men hardly receive any backlash but if a  man remotely said anything sexist, it ruins his entire life!! What  **Maisie Williams** is saying in the poster can be described as discrimination because she is discriminating everyone who isn't a feminist.

It's like these people live on an entirely different world where money grows infinitely  on trees and everyone has a mansion with enough space to accomodate 10 chldren. Are they completely oblivious to the goliath young parents face when forced to bring children into this world, only to sink along them in a sea of debt? Even though the wealth of someone should never dictate whether they can have an abortion or not, forcing people to bear kids they do not want is a fascist intrusion to human rights no matter how much they try to make it seem like they do it FOR human rights. I strongly believe they just want more people for their \"meat-grinder\". This system feeds on young blood and displays its addiction to it with every opportunity. They need more poverty because they want slaves, not workers. Enforcing an increase in population this way, as an act alone reveals a very disturbing backward-pacing agenda which in the name of God attempts to enslave and have absolute control over humanity's fundamental rights, for which we paid with rivers of blood. This is not a dystopic scenario, this is happening and we're just standing here defenseless, oppressed and petrified by its relentless, impulsive appetite and rapidly increasing momentum.

{"author":"Suxclitdick","body":"I originally posted this as a reply, but many of the comments were deleted so I'm going to leave it as a top level comment because it applies to anyone who is inclined towards the \"gender critical\" philosophy. At the end I also talk about why it's important to not allow anti-trans discourse to flourish. People should ask questions and have conversations, but outright bigotry should not be tolerated.\n\n>I do want to highlight that abusers will continue to be abusive, and that will happen regardless of whether trans people have a right to exist or not. Men can already go into women's bathrooms and sexually assault women without needing to go through the trouble of transitioning. Women's spaces can get harassed and overtaken by sexist men regardless of whether you let trans people in or not. Blaming trans people for the toxic masculinity that leads sexual violence against women is missing the heart of the problem, which is how men are socialized, and the fact that societies often excuse sexual violence with few to no consequences. None of those problems relate back to trans people, but it does relate to how society treats people as second class citizens based on gender.  \n>  \n>The gender critical philosophy may seem feminist on the surface, but it is actually quite sexist in it's interpretation of gender. It assumes being born with mostly female sex parts and being a woman\/female are the same thing, which is false. Gender is a social construct, and it comes down to behaviors and roles that are taken on by an individual. We don't know someone's sex until we examine their chromosomes, hormone levels, and gonads. So, in reality, what we initially perceive a person as is called gender. We also arbitrarily assign gender based on sex at birth, which we perceive as a binary, but biological sex is nuanced and complicated. Even calling it a binary is false, since having more than two options in a binary negates a binary. Here's a great Scientific American article that visualizes sex as the spectrum that it truly is. There are millions of intersex people, and erasing them from the gender conversation is reductionist and doesn't help women to overcome societal forces that treats us poorly.  \n>  \n>Treating gender as a biological fact also only helps to put us into boxes and roles based on how other people perceive what our gonads, hormones, and chromosomes are, which can be any combination of things. Sex isn't binary, so why should gender be? Biological sex should not be socially important, except for a narrow set of clinical and interpersonal situations. The fact that gender is important in how society treats people only goes to show that gender itself needs to be examined and reconstructed based on treating people with dignity and respect.  \n>  \n>It's important to remember too, that trans women are statistically much more likely to be victims of violence than their cis counterparts. Trans people are struggling against a society that thinks they should not exist, and most of them want to just live be happy. They encounter high levels of harassment for simply existing, just like cis women.  \n>  \n>The problem with anti-trans discourse, is that it allows a culture of violence against trans people to flourish. By allowing anti-trans discourse, we create environments where they are second class citizens who need to defend their right just to exist. You say you want the identity of women to have importance, but all women are also just individuals with their own unique background and identity. The problem is, when you try and define a woman beyond \"someone who is perceived as a woman\" you start feeding into biological\/gender essentialism arguments. If you are not aware what that is, it is the mode of thinking that has justified oppressing women in the modern era. Women are clearly just as capable as men at functioning in the modern world, especially when actually given the right set of social conditions and opportunities. Our gender roles are socially constructed, and the important thing is, they aren't encoded in our DNA. We can reconstruct society to be kinder and more respectful to women, and trans people are helping with that process, not hurting it.","created_utc":1659602008000,"comment_id":"iiuqy1x","parent_id":"t3_wefmpn","score":10,"submission_id":"wefmpn"}

{"author":"Suxclitdick","body":"I'm going to vote in November, and I already voted in the primary. Let's vote, but also, lets not delude ourselves into thinking electoralism will save us. Rights are fought for in the streets, and when politicians are scared enough the bill goes through. There isn't a movement that gained leverage that didn't include some violence, including feminism.\n\nDemocracy, true democracy where there are free and fair elections is a goal. We don't have that. I think voting can make a difference on a local level, and it works when corruption isn't rampant, but the US has legal corruption. Black people are gunned down in the streets, anyone befallen by an expensive tragedy will become homeless, poor women are dying and being forced to give birth without healthcare, and the US trudges on because we were always a state that enslaved people, and we never stopped.\n\nI think people are terrified of fascism, and the problem is, the rule of law won't stop fascism. Fascism doesn't listen to reason, it doesn't respect the vote. It claws its way into power by any means necessary, we are just watching that happen in slow motion. The way democrats are currently behaving, we know they definitely won't stop fascism. Radical change is coming, whether we want it to or not. It's just a question of what direction it will go. It is going to get worse before it gets better. So ask what more you can do besides vote. Do you want to fight with the communists and socialists about whether or not voting is worth it, or do you want to organize towards more radical action? We need to get organized on the left, and we need to meet fascism with an appropriate response. You can't reason with a fascist, and we really need to stop pretending we can.","created_utc":1657859032000,"comment_id":"ig6akrm","parent_id":"t3_vyuhh3","score":16,"submission_id":"vyuhh3"}

{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":"Women are called prudes if they oppose sexualized male violence. \n\n>In her chapter entitled \"Oppression\" in the book\u00a0Feminist Frontiers, Frye discusses the idea of the\u00a0double bind\u00a0in gender. This double bind refers to \"situations in which options are reduced to a very few and all of them expose one to penalty, censure or deprivation\". Frye applies this principle to gender and the dilemma women often face in her discussion of oppression. For example, it is neither socially acceptable for a woman to be sexually active or for her to be sexually inactive and labelled a \"man-hater\" or \"uptight\". This absence of choice permeates so thoroughly into women's day-to-day life that even small things like how they choose to dress or talk are criticized. Frye acknowledges that men face issues as well, but differentiates the issues of men and women through the metaphor of a bird cage. Each individual bind women face can be thought of as a single bar in a cage: by itself, it isn't enough to contain the bird. But, with enough bars, the bird is trapped inside the cage, left with nowhere to go. This is the complete absence of choice Frye describes: how it is the culmination of issues women face that is so \"immobilizing\" and why their struggle, and not men's, is considered\u00a0oppression.","created_utc":1609386005000,"comment_id":"ghj1s5i","parent_id":"t3_kn6fl3","score":48,"submission_id":"kn6fl3"}

{"author":"MetalBeholdr","body":"So, there's probably some truth to this but there's more to it.\n\nWomen genuinely do get hired as servers more, because they statistically get tipped better. The better your workers are tipped, the less you have to pay them. So, female server=greater profit, and gender norms have followed that trend. \n\nCapitalism is fundamentally tied to the patriarchy (Bell Hooks aptly describes modern America as an Imperialist, Capitalist, White-Supremacist Patriarchy, which I feel covers all the bases). If waitresses make the boss more money, then being a waitress is a job for girls. It's that simple. \n\n*Why* do waitresses make more in tips? Perhaps it is because of the disempowering nature of the job. Maybe people want to \"reward\" their adherence to the expectations of yesteryear. Maybe it's because men are seen as more self-sufficient and less in need of money. Maybe it's because they get hit on constantly and men think throwing money at them will earn their affection. I don't really know. \n\nGranted, this all comes from personal observations, from a male who has been stuck in more than one restaurant job. The layout is always the same: men (and older women) in the back, young women out front.","created_utc":1613657647000,"comment_id":"gnuxm3c","parent_id":"t3_llt9y5","score":8,"submission_id":"llt9y5"}

Over the last 3 decades, as the percentage of women have increased in the field, there has been increasing pressure on doctors to do more for less pay, increasing burdens of uncompensated paperwork, and increasing oversight on the part of health insurance companies and malpractice insurance companies over physician decisions.  \n\nI believe health care professions will be the next teaching professions.

{"author":"rottenhumanoid","body":"A lot of comments on this post are assuming that this post is about idealizing period bleeding. The sight of blood can be gross for many people, I myself can get nauseous at the sight of blood when I'm bleeding heavely. The difference is bleeding from any other body part is not a taboo as it is with menstruation. I don't have to hide my band aids like have to hide my pads\/tampons etc. I don't have to use code words for a nosebleed, but if talking about menstruation in polite company, I have to say \"that time of the month\". This is the hypocrisy that this post is about.\n\nI'm from a very conservative country, so for me this post is more relatable. My mom used to hide pads deep in the closet so that they are not visible to anyone. We had to make sure that the pads are discarded in such a way that no one can see them in the trash can. We had to put extra clothes in the underwear under the pad to make sure there is no leak at all. Can you image the discomfort?  So what if there is a spot on my shirt? I can go change it. Just like I would if my clothes got spoiled from any other bleeding.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there. The very religion I was raised in called women disgusting for a process that was made by the very God. You cannot pray or even touch the holy book during periods. Why? \n\nSo yeah this post is not telling you to not be grossed out by blood rather treat it as you would any other bleeding.","created_utc":1612143836000,"comment_id":"glhzx72","parent_id":"t3_l2mpcj","score":2,"submission_id":"l2mpcj"}

{"author":"AkuLives","body":"Good post. I think two things get mixed up here that lead the general population to think that girls mature faster than boys. In terms of brain and cognitive development, the only lead girls have is when they are very young. I mean 2-6 years old. Little girls tend show a communications advantage generally earlier than little boys. They tend to talk earlier and have more complex conversations earlier. \\[Females have verbal centers on both sides of the brain, whereas males usually don't.\\] People then assume that because girls can communicate better earlier that the this early lead can be generalized to brain and cognitive development. It can't. \n\nThen, when adolescence rolls around, girls bodies change visibly, where as boys more or less look the same. People look at an adolescence girl and think \"woman\" and judge her according to adult standards. They look at an adolescent male and think \"boy\" or \"teen\" and judge him  accordingly. But again, the assumptions are only based on surface, physiological development, not brain development. And again people generalize from what appears to be a mature body and assume that means the brain has also reached maturity. \\[It hasn't.\\] Finally, to make it the whole issue a really big mess, people's ideas, expectations and assumptions about maturity are deeply bound to socialization, culture and religion, as well.\n\n So yeah, say it louder for the folks in the back!","created_utc":1626066183000,"comment_id":"h4uixr1","parent_id":"t3_oi05ys","score":8,"submission_id":"oi05ys"}

{"author":"that-dudes-shorts","body":"The difference with all these \"medical procedures\" is that an abortion involves a life or a potential life that is not your own. I am totally for the right for abortion, but the \"my body, my choice\" is not an argument that covers the whole problematic imo.\n\nA child should be welcomed in a safe environment where you can provide for him, emotionnally\/mentally, financially and physically and none of these are options, they make a whole. If you can't provide one of these things, it is your right to ask for an abortion and nobody should be shamed for that.\n\nBut abortion should NEVER be used as another way for contraception.\n\nEdit: If you don't like the perspective of going through nine months of pregnancy and you feel like it's a punishment, then you are not ready for parenthood (the \"mentally\" element) and getting an abortion is justified.","created_utc":1558500889000,"comment_id":"eoddbsi","parent_id":"t3_br7475","score":-3,"submission_id":"br7475"}

I am trying to get over this, as people of all genders could do with dialogue around what feminism really is and how harmful the patriarchy is and has been, but any tips to do so would be welcome.","created_utc":1607485905000,"comment_id":"gf34tpq","parent_id":"t3_k93dh4","score":9,"submission_id":"k93dh4"}

Hence a lot of their works revolve around the trust between them.\n\nI recently watched a documentary that interviewed the both of them on their relationship as artists and once lovers. I remeber Ulay talked about how when he was asked \u201cwhy the arrow pointed at Marina\u2019s heart and not his\u201d he simply stated that \u201cher heart was my heart\u201d.\nFor the four minutes this performance lasted you could hear the anxiety high-ten through the microphone attached to record his heartbeat as he was subjected to being trusted with his loved one\u2019s life. Their works would\u2019ve worked with the roles reversed, in this case it just happens to be Ulay being the holder of the arrow. They have many other performances that explore similar topics so you\u2019re free to check that out as well! Notably their work Light\/Dark includes the two of them slapping each other equally at the same time. The rule between their performance was that they would stop if either one showed visible discomfort through their facial expressions. \n\nMarina explicitly states that this piece was about \u201ccomplete and total trust\u201d. Their works were about deploring the intimate relationship theirs with strict guidelines built upon their trust.\n\nIt\u2019s important to develop your own interpretations to an artwork as it nourishes diverse perspectives but please also consider the intentions of the creators.

On the day we were discussing abortion a guy was giving his pro-choice remarks, and afterwards, he was told three separate times, by three separate women in the class, that while they appreciated his sentiment, he really doesn\u2019t understand the stakes or the emotions involved, and that it was nice that he agreed with them, but that he was simply ignorant to the subject, and so his opinion doesn\u2019t hold any weight. One of them said it was akin to a child arguing economic policy, maybe they have good intentions, but don\u2019t get any to decide in the matter.\n\nI truly think that even those who are pro choice don\u2019t say much because the are told their opinions don\u2019t matter, and so what is the point of voicing them. They don\u2019t want to seem like they are talking over people who\u2019s opinions _do_ matter.","created_utc":1560930856000,"comment_id":"erin7x9","parent_id":"t3_c22twb","score":32,"submission_id":"c22twb"}

I couldn't understand how men could be so nonchalant when, every week, girls were being found dead in bathrooms and motel rooms, or taken to hospitals bleeding to death. How girls suffered at home from post-abortion infections and crude home-attempted abortions because they were terrified that a doctor would report them. But very few men were ever vocal in support of  abortion rights.  Many would admit they had no interest at all because it \"didn't affect\" them.  When the birth control pill was fought for and had to be defended from what became 'pro-lifers' in the late 50s\/early 60s, men had plenty of opinions at home, but there were damned few pro-pill public voices.","created_utc":1560944124000,"comment_id":"erj4c4f","parent_id":"t3_c22twb","score":5,"submission_id":"c22twb"}

I read a post a while back from a person who said, as a kid in school, that girls seemed to always told what to wear, how to act, how to stay safe from sexual assault but boys were never told even the basic \u2018do not sexually assault people.\u2019 The example in the last sentence is gendered, but the post is not gendered. Sexual assault can be committed by any gender, and any gender can be sexually assaulted. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling attacked by this post, before ignoring that feeling or writing a nasty comment, ask yourself why you feel that way. Then put yourself in the shoes of a person who has been sexually assaulted and ask yourself if they feel attacked when society blames their assault on their outfit choice.","created_utc":1560034018000,"comment_id":"eqekg2d","parent_id":"t3_bxy0ff","score":21,"submission_id":"bxy0ff"}

{"author":"The_Immanent","body":"It's true. They are also doing whatever they can to stop women from divorcing their abusive husbands. Domestic violence is considered \"family business\" in China and no one will interfere if the husband beats the wife (except maybe some kind hearted neighbor or the family of the woman). If she seeks to get divorced, the court is always going to deny her at the first time (it's not a written down policy but it's common practice). Then she will need to appeal to the court again. It takes a long time. There are women who are killed before they can get a divorce. A cheating husband is not enough reason to have a divorce. Also the court would often let the husband have custody of the kids if he makes more money, regardless of his behavior. The point of making more people stay in marriage, is to produce more babies (despite the already huge population) so there are enough young (and cheap) labor in the society.

{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":"English conservative \"feminists\" (also known as equity feminists) say that same thing to gaslight feminists and women who complain about women's underrepresentation in STEM and politics, gendered wage gap and more. Two most important characteristics of these women are: \n\n1. Believe in scientific sexism -- women are intellectually inferior etc. When feminist scientists challenge scientific sexism, these women dutifully come forward to accuse them of being science denialists. \n\n>\n2. Strongly support GC rethorics (transphobia and interphobia) and sex positivity (pornography, marriage, prostitution etc.) and oppose feminists that promote \"victim mindsets\" (their words, not mine).\n\nFrom wikipedia: \n\n>Equity feminism\u00a0is a form of\u00a0liberal feminism\u00a0that advocates the\u00a0state's equal treatment of women and men, without challenging inequalities perpetuated by employers, educational and religious institutions, and other elements of society. The concept has been discussed since the 1980s. \u00a0Equity feminism has been defined and classified as a kind of\u00a0classically liberal\u00a0or\u00a0libertarian\u00a0feminism, \u00a0in contrast with\u00a0social feminism, \u00a0difference feminism, gender feminism,and\u00a0equality feminism.\n\n>The\u00a0Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\u00a0refers to\u00a0Wendy McElroy,\u00a0Joan Kennedy Taylor,\u00a0Cathy Young, Rita Simon,\u00a0Katie Roiphe,\u00a0Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Christine Stolba, and\u00a0Christina Hoff Sommers\u00a0as equity feminists. \u00a0Camille Paglia\u00a0also describes herself as an equity feminist.][9]\u00a0Christina Sommers, in particular, explored the topic of equity feminism in her book\u00a0Who Stole Feminism?\u00a0In this text, Sommers summarizes how the aim of equity feminism is to attain economic, educational, and political equality of opportunity. \n\n>Steven Pinker, an\u00a0evolutionary\u00a0and\u00a0cognitive psychologist,\u00a0linguist, and\u00a0popular science\u00a0author, identifies himself as an equity feminist, which he defines as \"a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology\".","created_utc":1610162914000,"comment_id":"gikni8k","parent_id":"t3_kt4r6r","score":23,"submission_id":"kt4r6r"}

It was hard working with women in the bigger sizes who felt they needed to wear a moulded bra with thin straps when a) it doesn't exist in their size, b) even if it did, it wouldn't be the best thing for their size or shape.\n\nAll because the mere existence of bras is apparently offensive -_-\n\nIf I have a daughter and she gets shit about her bras at school...

In my whole life, I\u2019ve only read one book that really discussed this at length, and many have not heard of the book I recommend to others. At the same time, I\u2019ve heard these same comments and judgements my whole life. I am not a single mother but I am the product of one and have heard every single one of these things directed at my own mother, while my father came out unscathed for the most part even though he was largely absent. It has happened so much and I have barely ever heard the other side defend the women instead. From family, friends and strangers. It\u2019s still so true that men are viewed as heroes for \u201cstepping up\u201d as a parent, while women are only viewed as \u201cdoing their duties\u201d for the same tasks. The contrast is crazy. While it\u2019s true there are many forms where people are talking about this, it\u2019s not hitting people enough to change the way society is thinking about women as a whole. I\u2019d say majority of people still think these things are just normal.

Because if there were towns women could flee to for protection from their male abusers across the world, women would have real safety nets.\n\nThen if these towns are created, they could include schools for all genders, that families within a 100 mile radius of the community are welcome to send their children to for a reasonable (to the families income) fee. The only men allowed inside the community school will be students, and they would be thoroughly searched upon entry each day (as everyone would upon entry to the community in general to ensure no one\u2019s entering to try and extract a woman whose sheltered within). And the gates to said communities and schools would be guarded by women trained in combat, who would be the only people in the community armed with guns. These schools could provide kids not just ensured safety from school shootings, but also a wider worldview than the worldviews perpetuated in public schools. They could learn the actual truth of American history and the greater world outside of it. Which could help put an end to misogyny since the male children attending will not be taught that their God\u2019s gift & others ought to bow to their desires. It would help eliminate the mentality of male privilege, and eventually end the perpetuated patriarchal systems in favor of systems of equality & tolerance. \n\nUnfortunately, building these communities and schools will likely never happen because the men who want women to be oppressed own the government and would fight tooth and nail to obstruct these communities and schools, even if by some miracle the money for them were raised by the people who want to be able to send their children to school and never need worry if their children will be killed at school by some man with a gun. The evangelicals & regressives would cry \u201cmisandry,\u201d and \u201cmuh rights,\u201d and never allow us to actually create safe communities for women & children and safe schools for women & children within the walls of said communities\u2026\n\nBut it does make an excellent idea\u2026","created_utc":1653706988000,"comment_id":"ia86y9f","parent_id":"t3_uyxh41","score":10,"submission_id":"uyxh41"}

Things like not pressuring your partner for sex, not being abusive, being respectful and considerate are all really just basic human decency, and not worth praising whatsoever.

It's sad, because the fact of the matter is that the bare minimum *is* enough for many women, precisely because so many men are still violent and\/or abusive.\n\nI do have hope that this is changing though. Mostly because of awareness and posts like these, which have allowed me to find a partner whom I not only feel safe with (bare minimum), but whom I admire and enjoy the company of as well.\n\nEdit: lmao @ people crossposting this and claiming it's \"entitled\" to think non-violence is a low bar... just another example of feminism having more faith in men than anyone else.","created_utc":1628230866000,"comment_id":"h7v4ful","parent_id":"t3_oyo7ur","score":148,"submission_id":"oyo7ur"}

{"author":"Francesca_N_Furter","body":"This is so true.\n\nJust as an aside: my boss is nice, but a very, very strange woman.  \n\nShe has worked for the same company for her entire career, and when upper management promotes an initiative like \"making our workforce more diverse\" she goes in full-throttle.  Like there is no nuance to her judgement. She translates diversity to mean: Hire black women and put images of black women on all the marketing materials. \n\nWe were kind of jokingly debating why she could not see other types of \"diversity\" ... Indian women are not brown enough, and gay people might not be obviously gay, therefore ruining the appearance of a diverse workforce.  Hiring men in an almost all female department would be a step backwards in her mind.\n\nIt's really funny.  She's brilliant at work politics, so I am wondering if it is a company wide thing.","created_utc":1643604148000,"comment_id":"huwdtwg","parent_id":"t3_sg6tem","score":10,"submission_id":"sg6tem"}

{"author":"GlassMom","body":"I just talked to a guy yesterday who belongs to his natal denomination \"The Anglican Church of America.\" Back in the 70\u2018s, \"The Episcopal Church of America\" split over the ordination of women, creating the two, who both fall under the worldwide \"Anglican Communion.\"  Although he offerred, \"I know women are better at empathy and stuff\" stayed with his church and its tenets because he (and his wife) felt the \"order of things would be too disrupted.\"\n\n(Hang on a sec.  I'm not shooting for anger or eye-roll.  Allow me a little more of your attention.  I genuinely hope to make it worth it.  I think I can. \ud83d\ude82)\n\nAbout 10 years ago, \"The Episcopal Church of America\" split again starting with the ordination of [Gene Robinson](https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/V-Gene-Robinson), but pretty much being finished about five years ago with [Obergefell v. Hodges ](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obergefell_v._Hodges?wprov=sfla1) .\n\nSo, all of this happened primarily in the US, sort of.  The other continent having lots of Anglicans is [Africa](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anglican_realignment?wprov=sfla1), which is gaining influence.  This is good, racism-wise.  As you can imagine, for feminism and LGBTQIA+, maybe not so good.  There are definitely some intersectionality caveats deserving consideration buried in this.\n\nThe National Cathedral in DC is where political officials have their official funerals.  It's an Episcopal endeavor, building and all.  Before you go bashing state religious practice, any sociologist will pound you right back with burial rituals being the most civilized thing humans do.  It makes us remember, write history, and recognize and aspire to big lives like, RBG (despite doing so ineptly oftentimes).  Tons of other shit. The way we funeral and marry (procreate + childcare\/education) is critical to how humanity functions.\n\nDon't get me wrong, labcoats are a critical look for women, too.  But before you roll your eyes at Church Ladies, or lump all Christians together in one egg roll of idiots who believe in  \"a guy in the sky,\"  look to the women in cleric collars.

{"author":"undercurrents","body":"> Here are the words putting science in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s orders\n\n>National Science Foundation staff have been combing through thousands of active science research projects, alongside a list of keywords, to determine if they include activities that violate Trump\u2019s executive orders.\n\n\n>At the National Science Foundation, staff have been combing through thousands of active science research projects, alongside a list of keywords, to determine if they include activities that violate executive orders President Donald Trump issued in his first week in office. Those include orders to recognize only two genders and roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The search is driven by dozens of flagged words, according to an internal document reviewed by The Washington Post and two NSF employees with knowledge of the review process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak.\n\n>The words triggering NSF reviews provide a picture of the sievelike net being cast over the typically politically independent scientific enterprise, including words like \u201ctrauma,\u201d \u201cbarriers,\u201d \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cexcluded.\u201d\n\n>A sampling of keywords drawing scrutiny to science at NSF include:\n\nAdvocacy\nAntiracist\nBarrier\nBiases\nCultural relevance\nDisability\nDiverse backgrounds\nDiversity\nDiversified\nEthnicity\nExcluded\nExclusion\nEquity\nFemale\nGender\nHate speech\nHistorically\nImplicit bias\nInclusion\nInclusive\nInequities\nInstitutional\nIntersectional\nMale dominated\nMarginalized\nMinority\nMulticultural\nOppression\nPolarization\nRacially\nSegregation\nSocioeconomic\nSystemic\nTrauma\nUnderrepresented\nUnderserved\nVictims\nWomen\n\n>Scientists who receive NSF funding were already put on notice last week to cease any activities that do not comply with the executive orders. \u201cIn particular, this may include, but is not limited to conferences, trainings, workshops, considerations for staffing and participant selection, and any other grant activity that uses or promotes the use of diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) principles and frameworks or violates federal anti-discrimination laws,\u201d a message to investigators said.\n\n>Previously published health documents have been expunged from public-facing websites in the wake of a Jan. 29 memo from Charles Ezell, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, that was sent to all agency leaders. The memo instructed agency forms to record only an individual\u2019s sex and not gender identity. It also called for websites and social media to be scrubbed of content that \u201cinculcate or promote gender ideology,\u201d among other requirements.\n\n>In the wake of the memo, some published reports were removed from the Patient Safety Network website, an online resource produced by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). In one instance, a case study of a patient with endometriosis was taken down because the final paragraph said \u201cit is important to note that endometriosis can occur in trans and non-gender-conforming people and lack of understanding this fact could make diagnosis in these populations even more challenging,\u201d said Patrick Romano, a physician at the University of California at Davis and co-editor in chief of PSNet.\n\n>At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, staff were given a list of about 20 terms to guide decisions to remove or edit content on the website. Those words include: gender, transgender, pregnant person, pregnant people, LGBT, transsexual, nonbinary, assigned male at birth, biologically male, biologically female, he\/she\/they\/them.\n\n>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the NSF\u2019s review. According to an internal document and people familiar with the review process, NSF staff must analyze the keywords within grants and determine whether they are in violation of an executive order, providing a justification if they determine they are not. For example, the word \u201caccessibility\u201d would be flagged if it is used in the context of DEI, but is not if it is about data accessibility, the document explains. An internal email sent as an update clarifies some \u201cedge cases,\u201d including that the socioeconomic status of individuals is \u201cimplicated\u201d in the executive order, but rural communities are part of geographic diversity and are not.\n\n>The NSF is a $9 billion agency that funds scientific research across the globe, including research stations in Antarctica and astronomy observatories. Grants also fund research into quantum technologies, biology and earthquake risk, and support training young scientists. NSF grants are awarded to projects that advance scientific discovery and have intellectual merit, but they are also required to have \u201cbroader impacts\u201d on society. Those impacts encompass an array of goals, and many of them overlap with DEI, include broadening participation in science among underrepresented groups of people.\n\n>According to an internal document, NSF grants that are flagged for \u201cfurther action\u201d because they don\u2019t comply with the executive orders could be subject to a range of additional steps, including modification to be in compliance or being terminated in part or whole. A foundation spokesperson said they did not \u201chave anything else to add beyond what is available on our website,\u201d when asked about the process.\n\n>Morteza Dehghani, a professor of psychology and computer science at the University of Southern California, said he learned of the keyword screenings from a colleague at the NSF, who shared the list with him along with a flowchart used to evaluate whether a research project should be flagged for further review. Dehghani said he finds the keyword screenings to be antithetical to the established process for reviewing scientific endeavors.\n\n>He is among a cadre of scientists who volunteer to serve on panels that assess the merits and rigor of research proposals to help determine if they are worthy of NSF grant funding. That peer-review process is considered to be fundamental to scientific integrity: For example, panel members cannot review funding proposals from colleagues or anyone with whom they share a personal connection. He called the process \u201camong the biggest cultural products of essentially our time.\u201d\nDehghani called the keyword-based vetting \u201cunprecedented within the history of the NSF.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/science\/2025\/02\/04\/national-science-foundation-trump-executive-orders-words\/","created_utc":1739451911000,"comment_id":"mci3sz5","parent_id":"t3_1iobms5","score":239,"submission_id":"1iobms5"}

Researchers say their work is now at risk if it contains language deemed problematic by the White House, including the word \u201cwomen.\u201c\n\n>In his first week in office, President Donald Trump issued executive orders rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Now staff at the National Science Foundation are scouring thousands of research projects for dozens of words that could violate those orders. The agency already notified scientists to halt work that doesn\u2019t adhere to Trump's directives.\n\n>The list of banned words circulating at the National Science Foundation and science circles across the country includes: women, disability, bias, status, trauma, Black, Hispanic communities, as well as socioeconomic, ethnicity and systemic.\n\n>UC San Diego public health scientist Rebecca Fielding-Miller called the list Orwellian, and said it will hamper crucial research.\n\n>\u201cIf I can't say the word 'women,' I can't tell you that an abortion ban is going to hurt women,\u201d Fielding-Miller said. \u201cIf I can't say race and ethnicity, I can't tell you that Hispanic communities are experiencing this and that or that there's less vaccination happening in African American communities.\u201d\n\n>She added ultimately, the effect of removing those words will be so restrictive that researchers will leave, or shift focus.\n\n>\u201cI guess a word that's not on here is \"men,\" and I guess a word that I don't see on here is \"white,\" so I guess we'll see what's going on with white men and what they need,\u201d Fielding-Miller said.\n\n>Dr. Natasha Martin, a professor of infectious disease and global public health at UC San Diego, said banning words deprives scientists of the ability to describe the world accurately. \n\n\n>\u201cThe terms on these lists are essential scientific terms, and they are critical for both clinical care and public health,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThis is not a political issue.\u201d\n\n>Her own upcoming paper on the effects of fentanyl on HIV and Hepatitis C epidemics has been put on hold by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because it contains the word gender.\n\n>Meanwhile, UC San Diego researchers have been told to scrub their websites of diversity, equity and inclusion language.\n\n>While the Trump Administration reversed its pause on federal grants last week, UCSD still lost a $35 million USAID global research grant on reproductive health and nutrition.\n\n>Other federal money to the university is also in jeopardy. UC San Diego receives about $1 billion annually from the federal government.\n\n>As uncertainty and anxiety intensify within the university\u2019s science community, UC San Diego infectious disease researcher Dr. Davey Smith said he\u2019d like to see more advocacy from campus leadership and congressional representatives.\n\n>\u201cIt would be nice if we had some support,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe would love our leaders to say we love all of our researchers. We think they all deserve to be here. We don\u2019t believe what they\u2019re saying about you.\u201d\n\n>A request for comment to the university chancellor\u2019s office went unanswered. Congressman Scott Peters\u2019 representative told KPBS he was in transit and would not be available for comment until next week.

They would just insert it in there, I guess so that you knew that this was the goddess of sexuality, and to remind you how terrible that was. \n\nAnd the Mesopotamians seemly didn't really care about sex workers, or have a moral attitude one way or the other about them (other than generally being quite sex positive, but that's a chat for another day). The words for sex worker in Sumerian\/Akkadian don't really have a moral judgement, they are just job titles. But how do they get translated?

Yes it is shit sometimes, but thank God I had positive female, and actually male role models too, when I was younger, who actively called out this type of BS. It's very sad that more don't exist today.","created_utc":1616106510000,"comment_id":"grd2uqy","parent_id":"t3_m7r2jf","score":46,"submission_id":"m7r2jf"}

I went years having regular sex with plenty of guys, some of which were regular hook ups, so they knew me, and I only came ONCE during sex. I'd come ocassionally from fingering but rarely. So I was just sure there was something wrong with me. I still had sex because I find men attractive and it was still fun without the orgasm.\n\nThen I met my current boyfriend. There's literally no problem. I come everytime, most of the time many times (I am blessed with no refractory period), and often very hard. It's the best sex I've ever had. And I'm just here wondering what the hell the other guys were doing wrong, if it can be THIS easy for me to have amazing, regular sex.\n\nTbh the difference is that he actually listens, notices body language, and cares. After sex we will review what worked and didn't and he will actually take care to remember. He's also super patient and attentive with foreplay, so I'm always comfortable and ready. He just puts in effort to notice what I like. And he's never critical or pressures me to come.\n\nI guess the other guys never truly tried?

Too often, religion excuses the guilty and blames the victims - especially when it comes to sex crimes against women and children.\n\nMost organized religions have extensive histories of corruption and abuse that date back hundreds, even thousands of years that\u2019s somehow dismissed as one-off events and a few bad apples, despite these issues being widespread and common. It\u2019s all just another manifestation of the patriarchy. \n\nI have no idea how anyone lets their children be involved, with how many religious leaders actively harm children.

{"author":"Kailynna","body":"No, it doesn't. \n\nWomen, like men, can have a need to go out and socialise. When they do, not all have a friend they can go everywhere for protection. Not all of them can look strong and confident. Not all of them will stay sober. Some will be showing more skin than others. \n\nRapists will always check those around to see who looks the easiest  to rape, Even if they are all sober and wearing purdah, they will find one that seems less confident, younger, more vulnerable, than the others to prey upon. Besides, most rapes happen in the home. Last time I got raped I was wearing a long, flannelette nightie, asleep in my own bed with the doors locked.

You people are behaving as though males who watch rape porn are victims of a culture that doesn't produce enough good material. That's not true. These men are not interested in such materials. In reality, these males are a victim of culture that has already managed to teach them how to exercise male supremacy over womxn class. Thus your suggestions are completely meaningless here. \n\n3.

Don't order survivors, some of whom are porn actors, to listen to \"sex workers\" who find porn very empowering.

A lot of the household maintainance that women are pressured into doing isn't stuff that you could reasonably be paid for outside of a universal basic income. I'd argue the solution there is for men to start doing their fair share of these tasks. I have seen someone mention that the production of children is an essential service for society to function that women undertake without payment. The thing is in the UK at least there are child tax credits that parents receive amounting to a few hundred pounds per year until the child is 18. It could be argued that this partially solves the problem of mothers performing the unpaid labour of childbirth \/ childrearing and an expansion of this program could solve the problem entirely.

And it's not just their behavior that escalates, it's yours. How many times do you think you can look away, ignore it, dismiss it, laugh it off before that becomes your normal.

{"author":"wiithepiiple","body":"> And yet people will swear they don't know a single man who would assault someone.\n\nMost men who have raped don't consider themselves rapists or what they did rape.  Either they will convince themselves that she was into it or she really wanted it deep down or she said she wanted it when she was sober or some other justification.  Some may even consider it rape, but a momentary lapse in judgement that's all in the past.  People usually separate others into good people vs. bad people, and generally you and your friends are in the good category, so you don't need to worry about them doing bad things.  That's one thing I really liked about Promising Young Woman, where they cast either likable or non-threatening comedic actors as the rapists and rapist defenders, who generally play the relatable \"good guys.\"  Ultimately, it's your friends, coworkers, church members, gym buddies, etc. who when put in a position can rape or assault, whether it's when drunk or only with that one person they're in an on-again\/off-again relationship or if they were thinking they getting some and she said no.  The perpetrators of any sort of abuse are not affected as much as the victims, so you won't be able to pick them out of a crowd, i.e., \"the bully forgets and the bullied remembers.","created_utc":1616718763000,"comment_id":"gs6s1pe","parent_id":"t1_gs649si","score":28,"submission_id":"mcvsyo"}

But I decided to challenge myself and get past the uncomfortable stage and it turns out shaving was never for me, not once. I was just conditioned to think it was for me, to think its what made me pretty. Now I will never shave again. Because I honestly don't feel different with body hair, hygiene wise. I do feel emotionally different, I feel less pretty and less sexually attractive, I feel less than a woman. I notice the disgusted stares (I'm super hairy) I still have that male voyuer mindset when I look in the mirror. that's what bothers me.\n\nShaving, makeup, heels, nails, and sexy clothes make me feel really really good and valuable. So yeah, I could dress nice for male attention. But I don't necessarily think that's feminist? Because you are conforming to what's traditional attractive for men's viewing pleasure to feel good. It's not wrong if that's how you want to live your life but I don't really think that's feminist.\n\nIDK, I guess at the end of the day what I'm trying to say is that I choose the uncomfortable route, even when it's not easy. Even when I do feel less than. So that I can raise my daughter's around natural and non sexualizes female bodies so that's it's not uncomfortable for them. So that one day not dressing for male attention\/pleasure is the complete expected normal and we are truly equal. \n\nI don't think it's okay to attack or judge women for their lifestyle choices, but we should normalize questioning and breaking out of comfort zones on why do we do what we do.

It's important that people who care for the dignity of their causes hold fast to honest evaluations without inappropriately inspiring partisanship between groups.  Blind hatreds where we immediately leap loyally to opportunities to attack others are a symptom of corruptions to which we should not submit.\n\nWhite people getting lynched in Africa has a not very well-studied history, due to the poor development of that region.  Gay people of every \"color\" have gotten lynched in basically every region of the planet.  Black people getting lynched in America happened where development was worst, too; literal witch hunts were a symptom of an earlier, poorer era in which malnutrition was widespread.  In general, these diseases of violent suspicion spread almost epidemiologically in the most impoverished and hopeless communities of humanity.

{"author":"mfa811","body":"\"For generations, makeup has been seen as a \"girls-only\" enterprise, so we forget that it wasn't always that way. For millennia, stretching from 4000 BCE through the 18th century, men traditionally used makeup in myriad ways. It wasn't until the mid-1800s that makeup was relegated to one end of the gender spectrum. At that time, the influential Queen Victoria I of Great Britain deemed cosmetics vulgar, a view corroborated by the Church of England. During the Victorian era, makeup was considered \"an abomination\" by both the crown and the church, creating strong, widespread associations between makeup, vanity, femininity, and \"the Devil's work.\" As religious values continued to permeate cultures around the world, mainstream definitions of masculinity narrowed.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.byrdie.com\/history-makeup-gender#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%20in,makeup%20is%20not%20completely%20taboo.&text=For%20millennia%2C%20stretching%20from%204000,end%20of%20the%20gender%20spectrum.\n\nEdit: the point here is that makeup, or the concept of adorning yourself with colours and accessories, is as old as humanity and widespread among all times and cultures, for a multitude of reasons, from the ritual to the banal.

I think that\u2019s why many women have been almost desensitized to sexism. It\u2019s ingrained in media and made to seem normal. This is likely because a lot of things are written by men and the women who participate are indoctrinated into the same rhetoric because that\u2019s what keeps them employed. It\u2019s all propaganda really, meant to make women accept that this is just how things are. Honestly I used to love so many of these shows (the big bang theory, modern family, friends, how I met your mother, etc) but once I realized how it made me think about men and relationships, I started to see it for what it was. The glass shattered. The smoke screen cleared. \n\nIt\u2019s played for laughs because that makes it palatable. Take away that and you just feel sorry for the women in these stories because they\u2019re gaslit and made to feel like they\u2019re the ones who are \u201ctoo much.\u201d This is why so many girls go through the pick me phase, because we want to be seen as *not* like this, as accommodating and \u201ccool.\u201d But once you realize even if you are seen as this you\u2019ll never be one of the boys. You\u2019ll never fully be accepted. And honestly you start to realize you don\u2019t even want to be part of the boys club because it\u2019s just gross. It\u2019s just men talking shit about women and always acting superior. \n\nThis is why diversity and inclusion matters, because so long as men are in most the roles of authority, this will only continue.

We\u2019re SUPPOSED to see Claire as an absolute powerhouse that never really gets recognized because she\u2019s a woman. We\u2019re SUPPOSED to understand that while yes, one daughter is hotter than the other, that doesn\u2019t make her good or successful. And these nuances are why the show was so successful. It was taking all the very dated tropes of previous sitcoms and kind of blowing them wide open for the audience without hand-feeding the audience these messages. Like, nobody watches MF and thinks that Gloria is dumb or that Claire isn\u2019t the one holding everything together. The show wants and expects you to have the reaction you have, the only difference being that they expected you to know that they\u2019re in on it, and for whatever reason you don\u2019t. Maybe you just needed to have more experience with prior sitcoms or something. \n\nEither way, yes, you\u2019re right about everything, and your reaction to seeing it is correct, but you need to understand that the writers weren\u2019t being sexist, they specifically wanted you to have those opinions.

{"author":"TalkingMotanka","body":"I think part of it is an inherent feeling that they aren't about to be molested, so there isn't any need to take any precaution with dignity paper blankets, etc. As a girl, we are taught from a young age not to bring too much attention to our bodies. Why? Because of creeps. Who are the creeps? Almost always: men. \n\nBoys are taught to grow up and be a man, and some of those messages include how dominant they are over a woman, by slapping her backside when she walks by or cat calling, or anything else that draws attention to the sexual power they are reminding they have. Girls are taught that in order to avoid that sort of thing, to dress modestly and not be perceived as sexual otherwise, we give a message that \"we brought it on\". \n\nSo of course it makes sense that a man is not feeling vulnerable in a doctor's office, whereas women often do. The doctor is more likely to be a man, and the bits he has to look at sometimes involve us having to reveal our private areas. It's not natural for us to lose all inhibitions and yank our clothing off to be so exposed.","created_utc":1712713532000,"comment_id":"kyssy6w","parent_id":"t3_1bzt3rc","score":118,"submission_id":"1bzt3rc"}

Worst case scenario, I succeed, but why is that so bad? \n\nPeople limiting other people\u2019s potential burns me inside in a way I can\u2019t explain. _Really_ just enraged the shit out of me.

Imagine for a second a couple of big dudes holding you down and beating you and raping you and maybe using a broom handle as a \"toy\" for you?  Breaking your ribs and cheekbone?\"\n\nShe explained that it's good to have empathy, but it deflects the true pain and violence of the attack by not thinking about it happening to you personally.

{"author":"groceryenthusiast","body":"After MeToo the world seems fucking obsessed with false rape accusations but I think it is incredibly important to point out how rare these are. Statistics that are commonly cited here on reddit as \u201ccrazy high rates\u201d of false rape allegations usually include both cases that police have deemed false AND cases police have deemed unfounded. These unfounded cases are not necessarily false, rather they just don\u2019t have enough evidence for the police to pursue the case further. \n\nFurthermore the majority of false rape allegations DO NOT NAME A \u201cRAPIST\u201d!!!! This means that the likelihood any one man will be falsely accused of rape goes down significantly. Women may tell police that they have been raped for a multitude of reasons like wanting access to medical care, covering for an unplanned pregnancy, missing curfew. It\u2019s really unlikely that a woman comes into a police station, makes a false allegation of rape that names a particular innocent man as her abuser and gets away with it.\n\nIn one study of thousands of cases they found that the number of men who actually got charged with a rape they didn\u2019t commit was equal to the number of women charged with making a false report- so it REALLY isn\u2019t the case that there are tons of men being unjustly charged with a rape and tons of women getting away with lying. Furthermore these cases were extremely rare and none of the men charged were convicted. \n\nMen are FAR more likely to be the victim of a sex crime than they are to be falsely accused of perpetrating one. \n\nI recently wrote a paper on this subject and I am super passionate about this because I see this rhetoric about women being liars about rape all the time on reddit. \nI\u2019m not home at the moment but if anyone is interested I can add the sources I used for my paper later today!\n","created_utc":1547077777000,"comment_id":"edn2yux","parent_id":"t3_ae578m","score":6,"submission_id":"ae578m"}

{"author":"AstraofCaerbannog","body":"There was a very similar and rather disconcerting study where men were able to remain completely anonymous when answering various questions, including about rape. A shockingly high proportion openly acknowledged to having sex with women against their consent. They could find no particular similarities in these men besides their attitudes towards women, and that all of them, including when they looked at convicted rapists, denied having raped anyone. Essentially a lot of rapists are happy to admit to the act of rape, but not to the label of calling it rape. \n\nSo yes, I completely agree. It's one reason people have questioned using the terminology \"rape\", because the word is so heavily stigmatised that victims feel unable to label the act as such, and offenders refuse to admit to having committed the act under that label. I think partially because the term \"rape\" while it just means being forced into sex, is very stigmatised as being a very particular type of rape, which is against a stranger and severely violent. Fortunately more recently, awareness is being raised that rape is more of a \"catch all\" for the act of going against consent itself, rather than any description of how the act was committed. \n\nOf course, culturally, being a \"rapist\" is seen as bad, dirty. Some violent, evil villain, a stranger, not you or someone you'd known. But the act of forcing a woman against her will is so normalised, it has a history of practically seen as an entitlement in relationships, and a legal right in marriage which still exists in some countries. Women's bodies, culturally, are often presented as there to be used by a man sexually. Why cannot women just lay back and try and enjoy it while the man has his way? So long as he doesn't hit her what harm is done? That is how rape has been defended, literally by public figures in the past few years. That it's only fair that women share their bodies. That we are cruel for turning down incels (though of course, if we willingly gave in we'd be branded as sluts). They don't really see it as \"rape\", because they see women's bodies as an entitlement, and our desires and autonomy as not being relevant. Afterall, it's not like you could rape an inanimate object.","created_utc":1646521832000,"comment_id":"hzgih0s","parent_id":"t3_t7al1u","score":203,"submission_id":"t7al1u"}

The original text did not refer to them that way. Dr. Wilson refers to them instead as \"girls\", to highlight their age and the brutality of the action.\n>\n> She also all the times the previous male translators dodged\naround the existence of slaves in the text. Where they call slaves\nanything but slaves (housemaid, nurse, cook, ect.) Dr. Wilson's\ntranslation correctly calls them slaves as in the original texts. It's really a great translation, it doesn't soften anything, and lays bare the reality of the story.\n> \n> One thing she did too, was she refused to make the descriptions of the women in the story more palatable to modern western\nstandards. The original text, for example, describes hands\nas \"thick\". Most male translators change this to \"steady\" but Dr.\nWilson's translation calls them \"firm, muscular hands\" to\nportray the original intent, that Penelope, as a character who weaves\nevery day and every night undoes her weavings, has strong hands, as\nweaving does make one's hands more muscular, and that was clearly\nwhat was originally intended to be said given the context of her\ncharacter and the weavings.\n> \n> Of Odysseus himself, the original epic calls him poly, meaning many, and tropos, meaning turn. Some male translators used this to say the story itself had twists and turns, other ignored the word completely to write in a way that made Odysseus seem as though a straight up hero, a man \"skilled in all ways of contending\", but Dr. Wilson uses it to mean because Odysseus isn't a straight up hero, he does some really shitty things.\n>\n> So her translation got a lot of men very very mad, because they said that her being a woman has caused her to translate with bias since her translation is so different to others. She out that people should have suggested that bias in the inaccurate men's translations.\n> \n> Anyway, go read Dr. Wilson's version of The Odyssey.

{"author":"angery_alt","body":"It\u2019s a little more complicated than that. Here\u2019s a good article that gets into the details that many headlines seem to brush over, but also seems to be respectful of the athletes in question: https:\/\/olympics.com\/en\/news\/semenya-niyonsaba-wambui-what-is-dsd-iaaf-regulations\n\nThe DSD regulations are the following, an inclusive list (ie \u201cand\u201d, not \u201cor\u201d):\n\n-\tXY chromosomes\n-\tinternal testes instead of ovaries\n-\ta blood testosterone level in the \u201cmale range\u201d (above the 5 nm\/L normal maximum for cis women)\n-\tandrogen sensitivity (ie, not only high testosterone but the ability of their body to make use of it)\n\nI have so much sympathy for what these women must be going through - I can\u2019t even imagine the extent of the shock and frustration and the invasiveness of something like this. These women were observed to have female external genitalia at birth and assigned female, have lived their lives as female, have known themselves to be female. Many DSD folks don\u2019t even know they aren\u2019t anything but the sex they were assigned at birth until they get into athletics and are tested (for example, that they didn\u2019t get their period wouldn\u2019t necessarily have been a red flag, since many athletic women and girls with low bodyfat % lose their period).\n\nI don\u2019t see a solution that won\u2019t be painful for somebody. A person with XY chromosomes, and testes pumping out large amounts of testosterone, and a body that uses that testosterone, undeniably has an advantage over a cis woman without DSD. We have sex segregated sports for a reason. And they didn\u2019t outright ban these women - they are allowed to compete if they either do a different event, in which this condition seems to have less of an impact, or if they take a medication to lower their testosterone levels to the female maximum (5nm\/L). But I can see how jarring and awful this whole thing must feel for the DSD athletes, how they might have learned about a deeply private medical condition they have at the same time as the rest of the nation. And now all of a sudden they have to either not compete in their chosen event, or else take a medically unnecessary medication to alter their perfectly healthy bodies.","created_utc":1626132098000,"comment_id":"h4xfzv8","parent_id":"t3_oikf4x","score":41,"submission_id":"oikf4x"}

Similar policies have existed for more than 5 decades to exclude intersex women from sports, i.e, intersexism in Sports predates TERFism. Unfortunately a prominent trans woman biophysicist supports this policy and not to mention the fact that a lot of GC bigots are cheering.","created_utc":1626101770000,"comment_id":"h4w8lxz","parent_id":"t1_h4w1crs","score":53,"submission_id":"oikf4x"}
{"author":"sinxequaltox","body":"I mean, you can argue the philosophy of what exactly a fetus is all you want. In the end, I don't think it matters.\n\nYou can't even legally force someone to donate organs to save a life AFTER THEY DIE. That's an actual, non-debatable human being you would be saving. Yet we consider the bodily autonomy of a dead person more important than that life.\n\n\nAnd even if you were in favor of mandated organ donorship, that still doesn't even close to the kind of infringement of autonomy that illegalizing abortions is.\n\nI feel like a more (though not perfectly) accurate analogy is this:\n\nSomeone is dying from a disease that would require a lot of blood donations to be cured. There is only one person - let's say a man - available who could donate blood to this guy, which would mean:\n\nHe would have to donate blood at an enormous rate for a long period of time (9 months or so); an amount which would definitely screw up his body temporarily, and possibly permanently.\n\nHim dying from blood loss is unlikely, but possible.\n\nShould he be forced to do that? No. And a woman shouldn't be forced to carry a fetus, even if that fetus were a baby.","created_utc":1642267688000,"comment_id":"hsqw757","parent_id":"t3_s4as1g","score":261,"submission_id":"s4as1g"}

If the payout was on par with the \"average persons lifetime earning potential\" which, at the moment, is $1.7M in the usa, that means that the cost *Before insurance company overhead* would be minimum 1\/10 of 1.7M.   which is 170k...

Some ordered the removal of these words from public-facing websites, or ordered the elimination of other materials (including school curricula) in which they might be included.\n\nIn other cases, federal agency managers advised caution in the terms\u2019 usage without instituting an outright ban. Additionally, the presence of some terms was used to automatically flag for review some grant proposals and contracts that could conflict with Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders.\n\nThe list is most likely incomplete. More agency memos may exist than those seen by New York Times reporters, and some directives are vague or suggest what language might be impermissible without flatly stating it.\n\nAll presidential administrations change the language used in official communications to reflect their own policies. It is within their prerogative, as are amendments to or the removal of web pages, which The Times\u00a0[has found](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20250310151452\/https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/02\/02\/upshot\/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html)\u00a0has already happened thousands of times in this administration.\n\nStill, the words and phrases listed here represent a marked \u2014 and remarkable \u2014 shift in the corpus of language being used both in the federal government\u2019s corridors of power and among its rank and file. They are an unmistakable reflection of this administration\u2019s priorities.\n\nFor example, the Trump administration has frequently\u00a0[framed](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20250310151452\/https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/presidential-actions\/2025\/01\/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity\/)\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as being inherently at odds with what it has identified as \u201cmerit,\u201d and it has argued that these initiatives have resulted in the elevation of unqualified or undeserving people. That rhetorical strategy \u2014 with its baked-in assumption of a lack of capacity in people of color, women, the disabled and other marginalized groups \u2014 has been\u00a0[criticized as discriminatory](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20250310151452\/https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/02\/03\/us\/politics\/trump-diversity-racism.html).\n\nIndeed, in some cases, guidance against a term\u2019s usage has arrived alongside directives intended to eliminate the concept itself. Federal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are one example; the Gulf of Mexico is a very different one.\n\nThat shift is already apparent on hundreds of federal government websites. A New York Times analysis of pages on federal agency websites, before and after Mr. Trump took office, found that more than 250 contained evidence of deletions or amendments to words included in the above list.\"","created_utc":1741651162000,"comment_id":"mh1gwtb","parent_id":"t3_1j81y8d","score":160,"submission_id":"1j81y8d"}

If a person hits you, you have a right to defend yourself regardless of what\u2019s between their legs.\n\nI always appreciated that from her.

{"author":"draypresct","body":"I decided to geek out and try to answer the question 'Does education work to prevent rape' based on the current literature. It looks like education may be a promising avenue to explore, but we haven't completely nailed down approaches and effectiveness on wide-scale reductions in sexual assault. \n\n* There is fairly substantial literature linking general education with lower crime rates ([here's a description of one example](https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2011-12-lowers-crime.html)). So it's not completely implausible that criminal behavior may be modifiable in some general way.\n* On a small scale, educational programs (not self-defense classes) on sexual assault have generally been linked with [positive attitudinal and behavioral changes (including perpetration) among the participants](https:\/\/www.ncjrs.gov\/pdffiles1\/nij\/grants\/207262.pdf).\n* National rates are modifiable by *something*. [There is a substantial downward long-term trend in the US in sexual assault rates](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/191226\/reported-forcible-rape-rate-in-the-us-since-1990\/), but I have no idea how much of this is due to education and how much to other factors. \n* One national education program that *may* be contributing to this trend is the CDC [public-health-based rape prevention an education plans](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/sexualviolence\/rpe\/index.html) (first authorized in 1994). I'd love to see research evaluating the effectiveness of their approach, e.g. by comparing trends in sexual assault in states which implement certain programs versus states that don't. What I have found are studies that [evaluate their effectiveness](https:\/\/scholarworks.gsu.edu\/iph_capstone\/82\/) (or [plan to evaluate their effectiveness](https:\/\/doh.sd.gov\/documents\/Prevention\/RPE_SD_EvaluationPlan.pdf)) at getting the message out, which is an important step, but not the complete story. \n\nAnyone know the answer?","created_utc":1603836364000,"comment_id":"ga9ud64","parent_id":"t3_jizoal","score":17,"submission_id":"jizoal"}
{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":"Someone on this comment thread trying very hard to convince that \"40% rapists are women\" or women are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of \"made to penetrate\u2019\u00a0rape of male victims. Let's debunk it. \n\nThe specific type of sexual violence against men called \u2018made to penetrate\u2019 (which is sometimes referred to by more hysterical MRA types as \u2018envelopment') is a MRA obsession. The claim that men are \u2018made to penetrate\u2019 as frequently as women are raped, comes from\u00a0[an amateur interpretation of a 2010 study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an interpretation rejected by the CDC. The CDC says this about \u2018made to penetrate\u2019:](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/datasources\/nisvs\/men-ipvsvandstalking.html)\n\n>MTP is a form of sexual violence that some in the practice field consider similar to rape. CDC measures rape and MTP as separate concepts and views the two as distinct types of violence with potentially different consequences. Given the burden of these forms of violence in the lives of Americans, it is important to understand the difference in order to raise awareness.\n\n>Sexual violence is common. 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men experienced sexual violence involving physical contact during their lifetimes. Nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 38 men have experienced completed or attempted rape and 1 in 14 men was made to penetrate someone (completed or attempted) during his lifetime.\n\n1 in 14 men have been \u2018made to penetrate\u2019 (completed or attempted) and nearly 1 in 5 women have been raped (completed or attempted), therefore almost 3x as many women have been raped as men have been \u2018made to penetrate\u2019, and of those men,\u00a021%, over a 5th, reported male perpetrators, so it is not true to say that women are committing sexual violence against men at the same rate as men are committing sexual violence against women.\n\n>MRAs have tried a new strategy, seizing on data from\u00a0The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, a massive study conducted in 2010 under the aegis of the Centers for Disease Control, to claim that \u201c40% of rapists are women.\u201d Trouble is, this claim is flat-out false, based on an incorrect understanding of the NISVS data. But you don\u2019t have to take my word for it:\u00a0the NISVS researchers themselves say the MRA \u201cinterpretation\u201d of their data is based on bad math.\u00a0It\u2019s not just a question of different definitions of rape:\u00a0the MRA claims are untenable even if you include men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d women as victims of rape\u00a0(as the MRAs do)\u00a0 rather than as victims of \u201csexual violence other than rape\u201d (as the NISVS does). The \u201c40% of rapists were women\u201d was derived from these two steps: \n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Combining the estimated number of female rape victims with the estimated number of being-made-to-penetrate male victims in the 12 months prior to the survey to conclude that about 50% of the rape or being-made-to-penetrate victims were males;\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Multiplying the estimated percentage (79%) of male being-made-to-penetrate victims who reported having had female perpetrators in these victims\u2019 lifetime with the 50% obtained in step 1 to claim that 40% of perpetrators of rape or being-made-to-penetrate were women.\n\nNone of these calculations should be used nor can these conclusions be correctly drawn from these calculations.\n\n\u00a0While the percentage of female rape victims and the percentage of male being-made-to-penetrate victims were inferred from the past 12-month estimates by combining two forms of violence, the percentage of perpetrator by sex was taken from reported estimates for males for lifetime\u00a0(a misuse of the percentage of male victims who reported only female perpetrators in their lifetime being made to penetrate victimization).\u00a0 This mismatch of timeframes is incorrect because the past 12-month victimization cannot be stretched to equate with lifetime victimization.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, Table 2.1 and 2.2 of the NISVS 2010 Summary Report clearly report that\u00a0lifetime rape victimization of females (estimated at 21,840,000) is about 4 times the number of lifetime being made-to-penetrate of males (estimated at 5,451,000).\n\n\nAn arithmetic confusion appears when multiplying the two percentages together to conclude that the product is a percentage of all the \u201crapists\u201d, an undefined perpetrator population.\u00a0 Multiplying the percentage of male victims (as derived in step 1) above) to the percentage of male victims who had female perpetrators cannot give a percentage of perpetrators mathematically because to get a percentage of female rape perpetrators, one must have the total rape perpetrators (the denominator), and the number of female perpetrators of this specific violence (the numerator).\u00a0 Here, neither the numerator nor the denominator was available.\n\n\nData collected and analyzed for the NISVS 2010 have a \u201cone-to-multiple\u201d structure (where the \u201cone\u201d refers to one victim and the \u201cmultiple\u201d refers to multiple perpetrators).\u00a0 While not collected, it is conceivable that any perpetrator could have multiple victims.\u00a0 These multiplicities hinder any attempt to get a percentage of perpetrators such as the one described in steps 1) and 2), and nullify the reverse calculation for obtaining a percent of perpetrators.\nFor example, consider an example in which a girl has eight red apples while a boy has two green apples.\u00a0 Here, 50% of the children are boys and another 50% are girls.\u00a0 It is not valid to multiply 50% (boy) with 100% (boy\u2019s green apples) to conclude that \u201c50% of all the apples combined are green\u201d.\u00a0 It is clear that only 20% of all the apples are green (two out of 10 apples) when one combines the red and green apples together.\u00a0 Part of the mistake in the deriving of the \u201c50%\u201d stems from a negligence to take into account the inherent multiplicity: a child can have multiple apples (just as a victim can have multiple perpetrators).\n\n\nAs the study population is U.S. adults in non-institutional settings, the sample was designed to be representative of the study population, not the perpetrator population (therefore no sampling or weighting is done for the undefined universe of perpetrators).\u00a0 Hence, while the data can be analyzed to make statistical inferences about the victimization of U.S. adults residing in non-institutional settings, the NISVS data are incapable of lending support to any national estimates of the perpetrator population, let alone estimates of perpetrators of a specific form of violence (say, rape or being-made-to-penetrate).\n\n\nCombining the estimated past 12-month female rape victims with the estimated past 12-month being-made-to-penetrate male victims cannot give an accurate number of all victims who were either raped or being-made-to-penetrate, even if this combination is consistent with CDC\u2019s definition.\nBesides a disagreement with the definitions of the various forms of violence given in the NISVS 2010 Summary Report, this approach of combining the 12-month estimated number of female rape victims with the 12-month estimated number of male victims misses victims in the cells where reliable estimates were not reported due to small cell counts failing to meet statistical reliability criteria.\u00a0 For any combined form of violence, the correct analytical approach for obtaining a national estimate is to start at the raw data level of analysis, if such a creation of a combined construct is established","created_utc":1603852454000,"comment_id":"gaaru3f","parent_id":"t3_jizoal","score":11,"submission_id":"jizoal"}

The woman at the right is dressed in blue and gold, and points towards an oval-shaped mirror in her hand.*\n\n*At the lower right is a cropped image of \"Judith and Holofernes,\" showing a woman in lavish gold, blue, and red dress with her hair in elaborate curls.

He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah\\[c\\] of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing.  \n>  \n>16 \u201c\u2018**The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord. 17 Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.** 18 After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. 19 Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, \u201cIf no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. 20 But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband\u201d\u2014 21 here the priest is to put the woman under this curse\u2014\u201cmay the Lord cause you to become a curse\\[d\\] among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell. 22 **May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.\u201d**  \n>  \n>\u201c\u2018Then the woman is to say, \u201cAmen. So be it.\u201d  \n>  \n>23 \u201c\u2018The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water. 24 He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. 25 The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the Lord and bring it to the altar. 26 The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial\\[e\\] offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water. 27 If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: **When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry**, and she will become a curse. 28 If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.  \n>  \n>29 \u201c\u2018This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband, 30 or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife.

I'm not making excuses for anyone, rather pointing out what I see as a barrier to communication.\n\nWhen I had an abortion at 12 weeks I was only given 600mg of ibuprofen, and it was easily the most painful experience of my life. When my husband had a vasectomy scheduled, they had prescribed him *20 mg of oxycodone and 10mg of valium* when leaving the house, he would get *another* 20 mg of oxycodone and 10 mg of valium when he got to the office, a local anesthetic for the actual procedure, and then whatever pain control they gave him for home, which I can only imagine would have been a fucking morphine drip or a fentanyl patch right on his balls. (He didn't go through with it; i got my fallopian tubes removed instead.) Anyway, my husband is a wonderful man and human being, but he just didn't understand why I was angry about the situation. As i explained it to him, I could almost see the light turn on while he listened, and, after being quiet for a couple of minutes, he said he was appalled that women are treated that way in the 21st century. That was a few years ago, and now he participates in feminist subs and pays more attention to that kind of thing.\n\nThe point is that his mind simply didn't work the way mine does because he's not used to all the bullshit we see and experience on the daily. I think men assume that because we are a modern, industrialized society and women are in the workforce and #MeToo happened, that women are already equal. I think most of them assume that our experience is no different from theirs, which is really a normal human frailty that we all fall into at times. \n\nDo i get pissed when guys dismiss valid complaints like those OP made? Fuck yes I do. **Really** pissed. But I do think there's more to it (for *most* guys) than men being deliberately misogynistic.","created_utc":1629299784000,"comment_id":"h9dv0sk","parent_id":"t3_p6h96m","score":105,"submission_id":"p6h96m"}

{"author":"SSObserver","body":"I wonder if that\u2019s the reason. Like we know why you might take drugs or steal, the justifications are usually built in. We don\u2019t need to justify those acts because we\u2019re not usually confused ex ante as to why they were committed. I think most people have been tempted to steal and I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve all at some point felt murderous toward someone. But rape shocks the conscience because we can\u2019t imagine why someone would do that, for most people it\u2019s so outside the normal realm of mental experience that you just can\u2019t fathom how this person even got to the point where that was an action they were ok with, much less carried out. And because the human mind hates a vacuum we try to come up with explanations and justify it, figure out some reason why this rapist chose this person at this time to engage in this act. So for men who get raped it\u2019s something along the lines of, \u2018you must have enjoyed it otherwise you would have stopped her\u2019 and for women it\u2019s \u2018well did you lead him on?\u2019. The idea that it\u2019s simply random is just far too horrifying. I think we have similar reactions to serial killers. The idea that some random person could just decide to kill us is terrifying so we construct elaborate theories, which we don\u2019t for other types of crimes, to explain why we specifically are or aren\u2019t in danger so it at least seems less random. Now granted the theories have proven to have validity but the impetus for coming to them might have been similar. Obviously this only applies to a certain kind of rape, being taken advantage of by a friend or an opportunist is far different. I\u2019m by no means defending the behavior, but it is strange that people have that reaction and I\u2019m wondering if maybe this partially explains it?","created_utc":1562780318000,"comment_id":"etexe7o","parent_id":"t3_cbchkl","score":97,"submission_id":"cbchkl"}

{"author":"Auzune","body":"100% agree. I've always thought that rape is worse than murder morally speaking. Of course, it's worse being murdered than being raped (I know that it sounds horrible, but if you are murdered you are over, at least if you are raped you can recover and continue with your life), but it's worse raping than murdering because of what it says in the post. I'd even say that murdering can be justified up to a point, or at least we can understand why someone would do it, even if it's not in self-defence. For example, I don't think that someone who kills a terrorist, a rapist or a murderer in a moment of rage is a bad person. I sometimes think that I could be able to kill someone who has killed or raped someone I love because of hate, no self-defence. Murdering sounds like the worst crime, but in fact, there are things that are much worse, like raping, torturing, kidnapping... Those can't be justified.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add something to show how rape is considered a special kind of evil: we all see murder scenes in movies since we are kids, and it's not big deal. Kids know well since very young what murder is, and although it's a horrible crime, it's something that it's on display, not something hidden and taboo. Even more, sometimes the heroes commit murder and not only they don't stop being heroes, but they are supposed to act that way and become greater heroes (like a superheroe who kills a villain). However, when there's a rape scene in a movie, it is big deal. It's very uncomfortable to see it, and it leaves you with a very bad feeling, what doesn't happen with murder scenes.","created_utc":1562780870000,"comment_id":"etexso1","parent_id":"t3_cbchkl","score":39,"submission_id":"cbchkl"}

{"author":"Dmarek02","body":"It's because rape is the ultimate perpetuation of the patriarchical system. It is literally taking control from the person and imposing violence on the body. The majority of rapists are men and the majority of lawmakers are men. It is no accident that sexual violence is not seen on the same criminal level as property damage or theft.  It is because the victim,  who is always viewed through a feminine lens (despite their actual gender),  is seen as less human than the perpetrator and less deserving of rights. It's because the patriarchy insists all men are predators,  all women are weak,  and every one is cis-het in that binary system. The mainstream media (also owned\/ run by men)  pushes this narrative and keeps it alive. \n\nThis why the children who were raped by Epstein are referred to as \"underage women\",  this is why you can name 5 rapist\/ sex offenders of the top of your head but can't name 5 victims (despite the narrative that these people do it for fame and notoriety),  this is why there is endless advice on how to avoid being a victim and basically nothing on how to avoid being a predator (even though the brain is perfectly capable of learning this since it learned how to be a predator in the first place). This is why anti-abortion activists are able to cram their views down everyone's throats despite being the minority and run mostly by the catholic church,  which does not represent all faiths and is violating the first US amendment.","created_utc":1562805719000,"comment_id":"etfswp9","parent_id":"t3_cbchkl","score":8,"submission_id":"cbchkl"}

{"author":"sunshinecentered","body":"In another comment i said\n\n> Gay men are not immune to the patriarchy. I personally think that when men are devalued by the patriarchy (and gay men, men of color, and poor men most certainly are) it makes them anxious to establish that they are part of the patriarchy, which they do by being open in their hatred of women. \n\nI wanted to figure out if work had been done on that. Turns out there has been work done! In a [study of 547 gay men](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2902177\/) researchers found that masculine\n\n>ideology is dictated by four main rules: men should not be feminine; men must be respected and admired; men should never show fear; and men should seek out risk and adventure \n\nwhich \n\n> leads men to struggle with four main factors of traditional masculinity: men should be successful, achieve power\/status, and readily compete against others; men should restrict their emotions; men should restrict their affectionate behavior with other men; and men should be work\/career driven. \n\nand\n\n> One group that may have a distinct masculinity ideology is gay men. Gay men are seen to break from traditional masculinity ideology mainly because of their affectional and sexual orientation. Consequently, the general perception is that gay men are not masculine. \n\nGay men who are seen to deviate from traditional masculine ideology,\n\n>report more symptoms of psychological distress, higher degrees of shame, and are less likely to seek out help  than men who experience less conflict. Furthermore, men who are concerned about fulfilling traditional masculine ideals report greater interpersonal problems including engaging in high-risk behaviors  and experiencing more difficulties within romantic relationships.\n\nWhat I couldn't find is if challenging a man's masculinity causes him to act in misogynistic ways in order to reassert that masculinity.

{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":"And consent is not valid if it's obtained via heteropatriarchal social constructions -- coercion, misogynistic bullying, poverty, violence, money and more.  \n\n Consent is, after all, very low bar for sexual ethics and is often meaningless because men and male institutions have already learned how to use that conception of consent against victims of rape, trafficking, and sexual assault. Men who raped and assaulted women, are nowadays saying that they thought their victims consented -- that is, it's the victims'  fault that they are bad at communication or worse their victims' consent\" -- to acts of violence severe enough to require surgery and costly treatment or to cause death -- can be presumed. Male institutions and their allies have always constructed rape and other forms of sexual violence as subjective.\n\n>In this view [...] Rape is occasioned by women's resistance, not by men's force; [...] hence rape, is created by women's resistance to sex. Men would rape less if they got more voluntary, compliant sex from women. [...] If women would stop resisting, rape would wither away. On one level, this is a definitionally obvious truth. When a woman accepts what would be rape if she did not accept it, what happens is sex. If women were to accept forced sex as sex, 'voluntary sex would be available to more men'. If women no longer resisted [...] No woman would ever be sexually violated, because sexual violation would be sex. The situation might resemble the one evoked by a society categorized as 'rape free' because the men assert there is no rape there: 'our women never resist'\n\n>The sexual and political program is clear: if we change women's attitudes so that women accept and \"consent\" to sexual violence, then \"No woman would ever be sexually violated, because sexual violation would be sex.\" In other words, if we traumatize and gaslight women on a large enough scale, we won't have to worry about sexual violence anymore, because sexual violence as such will be invisible, seen a product of prudish women and not of men's power over women and sexuality. And as always, let's remind ourselves that \"[consent] is an intrinsically unequal [concept] ... that relies on an illusory image of women's agency under conditions of inequality, as if we can be free without being equal.\" A good example of this kind of gaslighting. Predatory men teach young girls that predatory behaviour just is what love is (in the same way pornography teaches that violence just is what sex is). The violence\/predation becomes subjective and thus invisible. \n\n>Consent as a concept was never designed to apply between two people in civil society. It was given its meaning in western liberal philosophy as the basis for legitimizing the obligation to obey the laws of the state. Even as a fiction, [consent] never envisioned equal parties; it exists to rationalize the exercise of dominant power of subordinates. Applied to sex, he is the government, she is the governed. [Consent's] purpose is to attribute and justify the obedience of the powerless to the rule of the powerful. You are regarded as consenting, for example, whenever you don\u2019t leave. You consent because you are there, whether leaving is a realistic possibility or not. Silence in sex, as in governing, is deemed consent not dissent. These assumptions, along with the presumption that the two parties are somehow equals, which is never either articulated or justified, operate powerfully in sex unequal circumstances, contrary to realities. Legal attempts to correct for this social burden of proof by adding additional words to make \u201cconsent\u201d mean anything at all like \u201cpositive\u201d, \u201cchosen\u201d, \u201caffirmative\u201d, \u201cautonomous\u201d, \u201cinformed\u201d, \u201cconscious\u201d, \u201cfreely given\u201d cannot be relied upon to overcome its basic meaning. Fundamentally, it needs to be faced that consent is not an equal concept. It is an intrinsically unequal one that presupposes an actor & an acted upon. The purported form of power of the acted-upon being acts ceding to the actor\u2019s actions\u2014in other words, doing what you are told. [The notion of \"consent\"] tends to presume the parties are equal, whether they are or not, and relies on an illusory image of women\u2019s agency under conditions of inequality, as if we can be free without being equal.","created_utc":1601838587000,"comment_id":"g7nvkoc","parent_id":"t3_j4ujsq","score":34,"submission_id":"j4ujsq"}

{"author":"wasabichicken","body":">It\u2019s pretty reasonable not to invest money in someone who\u2019s recovering from pregnancy.\n\nOh, you'd be surprised.\n\nHere in Scandinavia, expecting mothers are entitled to go on parental leave (paid for by the state) up to 60 days prior to delivery. This parental leave goes on for up to 16 months in total, split between the parents. During this parental leave, the employer still:\n\n1. Recruits and hires substitutes,\n2. Pays employee tax,\n3. Pays the yearly vacation salary,\n4. Frequently (if mandated by e.g. a collective agreement struck between employer and union) pays an extra \"parental salary\" to complement what the state is handing out.\n\nIt's quite generous, and it probably goes without saying that it is also **illegal as fuck** for employers to cut pay or fire expecting mothers\/parents for pregnancy reasons. Companies that try it anyway (citing BS reasons) risks getting dragged to court and sued for serious cash.\n\n>What does this have anything to do with feminism?\n\nThe definition of feminism, as found on Wikipedia:\n\n>Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, **economic**, personal, and social equality of the sexes.\n\nWhat we're talking about here is *economic* equality between the sexes. Women should not risk workplace repercussions for getting pregnant while men go scot-free, especially since becoming a parent is 1) extremely common, 2) a huge deal in peoples' lives, and 3) actually desired by our society. :) Our species needs to procreate to continue its existence, so it makes zero sense to punish women for it.\n\nI'd like to think that the reason this works so well in my country, with employers and employees alike accepting this, is because the rules apply to everyone: companies can't get an edge by firing pregnant people when it suits them, so the playing field is level.

{"author":"Laprasnomore","body":"I've been practicing \"you're making me uncomfortable\" more. As a normally super laid-back, blunt woman, it startles people when I assert my physical autonomy to stop them from doing something, especially with such a frank phrase. It's not \"*I'm* feeling uncomfortable,\" or \"You're *making* me feel uncomfortable,\" because those two phrases put part of the blame on my own feelings, when it's the other person who is at fault.\n\nThe first time I used it was with my brother, who crossed a line when he was joking around with me and a couple friends. He legitimately didn't know that he had, and when I finally said \"you're making me uncomfortable,\" he immediately stopped, startled, and said \"oh, am I? I'm sorry,\" then later commented that he hopes that I've never been uncomfortable around him before, thinking hard on what he had said. It was like magic, just like that I had redrawn the boundary line and he was going to abide by it. Now, my brother is amazing and a great person so I don't expect that from everyone, but it definitely changed the way I interact with people.\n\nI also need to somehow stop people from condescending to me or infantilizing me, but I haven't found the right phrase yet to express that one.

{"author":"cyanideNsadness","body":"I feel like people view porn as the one area that can\u2019t possible impact someone\u2019s lives. Have you ever seen ads? Products pop up on your tv, subtly influencing you to buy certain things or live a certain lifestyle. There are colored pictures of women in bikinis with all natural body hair because that\u2019s how recently it was acceptable. And then in a very short time, we started getting the messaging that \u201cfeminine woman don\u2019t have hair, buy our razors please\u201d. It becomes a cycle that changes our mind process (now when we see a woman with naturally occurring hair we view her as unfeminine and dirty) it changes our lifestyle and fashion (meticulous grooming, insecurity at stubble, not wearing a dress if you haven\u2019t shaved) and it influences our buying habits (waxing, razors, hair removal products) Sure, it\u2019s just an ad, it\u2019s not real, you don\u2019t have to believe it. But it becomes ingrained. \n\nBut porn somehow doesn\u2019t? It\u2019s reinforced with dopamine reactions designed to make your body enjoy it as much as possible. Most people view it frequently and consistently, and in many cases during young and extremely formative years. Societal discussion is that it\u2019s all completely normal and harmless, so walls are down and people are very accepting of the messages. But somehow this is the one thing that can\u2019t ever rub off on people? Please. I was a teen. My first sexual encountered consisted of me frantically shaving every inch of skin, dressing myself into a different person with itchy tight lingerie, and \u201cperforming\u201d movements and sounds without feeling the pleasure while another young teen male called me names, pulled my hair, was rough with me, and begged for anal. We were only children. This is not normal sexual exploration. But we were doing what we thought was right - even though I was sexually traumatized and in agony several times, and still to this day struggle to even enjoy anything because my headspace immediately moves to \u201cperform and please\u201d, I can\u2019t even blame a young man who doesn\u2019t know any better but these disgusting messages he\u2019s been drowned in. I\u2019ve had talks, we\u2019ve worked things out better and changed how we have sex, but to do so I had to go against the grain and challenge the perspective and feel like it was allowed not to like what every one told me was normal. But what happens to all the girls who fall silent when their struggles are shushed by \u201cit\u2019s fine, this is how this works, stop complaining?\u201d I only see a life of abuse, mental insecurity, and struggle.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure why porn isn\u2019t considered grooming. 11 is the average age kids discover it, I think I was 9 or 10? But if an adult sat down and gave a kid that young porn to watch, authorities would say it\u2019s abuse, those lessons would alter a kids sexual behavior (just like the children born in brothels witness their moms being passed around and that influences their view on sex) There really is a thing as too young to watch adults pounding away at each other. I think a lot of women could be diagnosed with Stockholm syndrome just from how their adult sexuality grew from being a child watching often terrifying sexual images and abuse of their gender. I\u2019m not against the idea of porn but I\u2019m against the current execution.","created_utc":1612482458000,"comment_id":"glzyg9p","parent_id":"t3_lc6xkh","score":51,"submission_id":"lc6xkh"}

Increasingly, women have participated in both its production, direction, and consumption. This study investigated how the content in popular pornographic videos created by female directors differs from that of their male counterparts. We conducted a quantitative analysis of 122 randomly selected scenes from 44 top-renting adult videos in 2005 (half male- and half female-directed). Findings revealed that all films shared similar depictions: Verbal and physical aggression was common, women were the primary targets of aggression, and negative responses to aggression were extremely rare. Compared to male-directed films, female-directed films were significantly more likely to portray women-only scenes and sexual acts.

{"author":"prgo96","body":"Thank you for this. I have been trying to get more well informed on this as earlier I was also one of those who wouldn't take the major problems with mainstream porn seriously. Now I do, and such posts help reinforce this lesson for me. Apart from the contents of the porn (which is definitely important and often deeply, horrifically problematic as both the post and the comment above citing research show), there is also the issue of behind the scenes off-camera treatment of performers, especially female performers. There is a lot of abuse and violence going on towards female performers, a lack of testing in the industry, lack of respect for their safe words while filming, increased roughness during the scene than what they signed up for or agreed to, all sorts of economic coercion, profit over welfare of performers, etc. There is virtually no regulation and protection for workers, especially young females.

I also had a history of painful, heavy periods. I was surprised the women gynos dismissed my pain as normal and one even told me that fibroids cause no pain (incorrect!). Another told me that my birth control must be the problem, yet her only solution was a different birth control. I also made it clear that I was childfree, so I didn't care about keeping my fertility or uterus, but these doctors thought they knew me better than I know myself, and told me I'd change my mind. And that some hypothetical child I wasn't having was more important than my pain.   \n\n\nI then research all the gynos available in my network, and found a male doctor next, given he specialized in these issues. He told me it was a quality of life issue as by now, I was having daily pain for over a year, intermittent pain for a few years before that, and horrific periods since 7th grade. The pain woke me up at night and caused me to curl on the bathroom floor in the fetal position sometimes (and I wasn't on my period as I didn't get one with my birth control). This is what the other gynos didn't care about and thought I should just deal with. I finally had a hysterectomy in January and am now finally pain free. It was what I needed all along yet I was treated as if my only value is birthing babies, and that I should suffer through the pain in case I changed my mind.

{"author":"ThrowRARolf","body":"The medical field is extremely bias and harmful to women. \n\nWomen take years longer (an average of 2 years longer for some types of cancer) to receive a diagnosis despite men having the habit of taking longer to see a doctor. \n\nWomen are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed after a heart attack\n\n9% of women develop PTSD from the birthing process from how their handled and treated\n\nDoctors don't get consent or tell women that they will be using them to train multiple students at a time on full pelvic exams. Even if you go in for surgeries that don't include the vagina and rectum, they might use yours to train medical students because it's free and you cant say no. SERIOUSLY one of the reasons they use for not getting consent is because they think some women will turn them down...so they just sedate you and do it without asking. \n\n Even after explicitly being told 'no', patients have reported that the doctor ignored them and did it anyway. One was a virgin who woke up while he was painfully swabbing her cervix with a speculum in. She was just in the ER for abdominal pain and had already refused that doctors request to do a pelvic exam so he drugged her and did it anyway. She couldn't sue because it's legal if she's sedated!!! \n\nAdding on to the point above they can also record your surgery and use it for teaching purposes. \n\nMedical salesmen are often in ORs. It's a shady practice and patient consent isn't needed in most states.\n\nPsychward nurses are known to fight with the doctors who prescribe medication to people struggling through mental illness. If they don't document that they've given a patient a certain drug then they can just pretend that they didnt, because legally it doesn't count if they don't document it. \n\nThe doctors want to give them a sedative so they can calm down and work through their problems and the nurses have control issues. The nurses want revenge on the patient for the swearing or outburst that they had earlier and they want the patient unconscious so they don't have to deal with them. They don't like doctors 'thinking they know these patients more' and they don't like not being the one in control of the patients so they give the patients 'nursing doses' or verbally abuse them until the patient snaps and calls the nurse a 'bitch' or something similar so the nurse then has the patient held down by like 7 security guards so they can give them a bigger does of sedative. \n\nSome psychwards are similar to the 'correction facilities' that have been showing up in the news. No one can record the nurses abusing the patients and the nurses proudly cover for eachother. \n\nSome of these 'professionals' boast online about all of this stuff if you just search for it sadly. \n\nIndigenous women in Canada are reporting that when they give birth doctors are taking their babies and making them get sterilized before they'll give them back. Their forcibly sterilizing these women.\n\nWe need to reorganize and deconstruct the entire medical field. It's sexist and racist.","created_utc":1617834075000,"comment_id":"gtovrmy","parent_id":"t3_mm1bdj","score":41,"submission_id":"mm1bdj"}

{"author":"dullaveragejoe","body":"I'd like to share the life of my great-aunt.\n\nShe was born in the 1930s, went to school. When she was 16 she met my great-uncle who was in his 20s. She fell head over heals in love, as 16 year olds do. College, travel, or birth control were not options. She knew she'd spend her life in servitude as a mother, it was all she'd been trained to want or expect.\n\nThey married almost the day she turned 18. There was no point even trying to get a job. The babies started coming immediately. Every year or two a new mouth to feed, or a miscarriage or an infant death. By the time she hit menopause she ended up with eight living children. \n\nMy uncle didn't come to the hospital for the births, didn't know how to cook or clean, didn't help raise children other than scold them for being noisy. He didn't see it as his job. My aunt once fondly remembered how he used to \"mind the children after dinner so I could get the dishes done\" as if it was the kindest gesture.\n\nAs a 1950s housewife she toiled all day. Woke up all night to feed the baby. Woke up early to prepare breakfast (scrambled eggs or oatmeal), dress the kids and walk them to school. When school was out the older ones were left to their own devices outside. During the day she'd plop the young kids in a playpen and cook\/clean. No dishwasher or laundry machines. Dinner was always homemade and on the table for 6. Sometimes she chatted with the other moms on the street, but she never went out with friends alone. She was active in church work. Never had hobbies or learnt how to drive.\n\nWhen the kids were all grown, she continued the work she'd always known, even after my uncle had retired. Relatives came to stay. Her sons needed taking care of until they were married and after they were widowed since they never learnt how to cook or clean themselves. \n\nShe spoke of my uncle with nothing but reverence. She was so \"lucky\" he took such care of her. She never contrasted his opinions except occasionally with a \"tsk\". He remarked once that anything other than missionary position sex was an abomination, so I guess she never had that kind of pleasure either. \n\nHe treated her as his employee. He sold the house one day and didn't tell her until it was time to pack. Of course, it wasn't her house or her money. \n\nWas she *happy*? Yes, she told me. Her meger life met her meger expectations. She had earned her place in heaven.","created_utc":1662937444000,"comment_id":"inzumdy","parent_id":"t3_xbf2ti","score":159,"submission_id":"xbf2ti"}

Notice that the patient is robbed of any form of self expression or intellectual activity. Women and other marginalized genders are still punished for speaking when they\u2019re harassed online.

I just left as fast as I could.\"\n\n*And later*, \n\n>\"I told very few people that we actually had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it.\"\n\nThis is\u00a0**not**\u00a0the testimony of a women who eagerly ran into bed with Trump. It seems like she felt strongly coerced into having sex with him, and the symptoms she's experiencing are\u00a0**not**\u00a0things women feel when they're excited and eager to have sex. Those are fight or flight adrenaline reactions.\n\nI expected her testimony to have more consent in it. She's told her story before but this was the biggest stage yet for her. This whole scene makes me feel so bad for her.","created_utc":1715236718000,"comment_id":"l3781e5","parent_id":"t3_1cmlv50","score":28,"submission_id":"1cmlv50"}

{"author":"Blood_sweat_and_beer","body":"I realized a while ago that there\u2019s a different between having rights and being able to exercise them. All women have the right to an abortion, for example, but some states\/countries choose to violate that right. All adults have the right to choose their adult romantic partner, but some countries choose to violate that right. All people have the right to present themselves as the gender they identify with, but some countries choose to violate that right. You get the picture. \n\nNever lose sight of the fact that rights are something inalienable, separate from governance. They cannot be given or repealed. They cannot be \u201cgranted\u201d or bestowed upon people like a gift, or \u201ctaken away\u201d.  Governments don\u2019t give us rights, they can only decide if they want to violate your rights or not.  Rights are simply an expression of what you, as a human, want to do with your own body for your own self-preservation, provided that you\u2019re not harming other people.  Everyone has the right to work and sing and make love and wear what they want and get an education and marry the person they love and search out healthcare and protest.  The issue is how easily people in power can choose to violate our rights and imprison us for not exercising our rights in the way those people in charge deem acceptable (which means that some powerful people get to use their subjective opinions to cut off access to objective rights, which is unconscionable).\n\nI know there is nuance. People claim that abortion is harming another person. People claim that gay marriage is harming other people. People claim that transgendered individuals are harming others. The list goes on. But those statements are subjective, not objective, as someone\u2019s gayness has literally never killed another person, and a woman\u2019s right to choose what happens to her own body is far more important than preserving a parasitic embryo. \n\nSo no, clearly men don\u2019t grant women rights any more than women grant men rights. Men are just a lot more adamant about violating women\u2019s rights than women are of violating theirs.","created_utc":1736463506000,"comment_id":"m68dxvi","parent_id":"t3_1hx56mz","score":62,"submission_id":"1hx56mz"}

And if you act sweet and demure, you're accused of reinforcing patriarchal ideas of female passivity, but if you stand up for your own rights and make your voice heard, then you are dismissed as wielding male privilege and entitlement. We trans women are made to teeter on this tightrope, not because we are transsexuals, but because we are women. This is the same double bind that forces teenage girls to negotiate their way between virgin and whore, that forces female politicians and business women to be agressive without being seen as a bitch, and to be feminine enough not to emasculate their alpha male colleagues, without being so girly as to undermine their own authority.\"\n\n\u2013 Julia Serano, *Excluded: Making Feminist*\n\n---\n\n^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TranscribersOfReddit\/wiki\/index)","created_utc":1619678649000,"comment_id":"gw89oj1","parent_id":"t3_n0qih4","score":89,"submission_id":"n0qih4"}
{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":">In her chapter entitled \"Oppression\" in the book\u00a0Feminist Frontiers, Frye discusses the idea of the\u00a0double bind\u00a0in gender. This double bind refers to \"situations in which options are reduced to a very few and all of them expose one to penalty, censure or deprivation\". Frye applies this principle to gender and the dilemma women often face in her discussion of oppression. For example, it is neither socially acceptable for a woman to be sexually active or for her to be sexually inactive and labelled a \"man-hater\" or \"uptight\". This absence of choice permeates so thoroughly into women's day-to-day life that even small things like how they choose to dress or talk are criticized. Frye acknowledges that men face issues as well, but differentiates the issues of men and women through the metaphor of a bird cage. Each individual bind women face can be thought of as a single bar in a cage: by itself, it isn't enough to contain the bird. But, with enough bars, the bird is trapped inside the cage, left with nowhere to go. This is the complete absence of choice Frye describes: how it is the culmination of issues women face that is so \"immobilizing\" and why their struggle, and not men's, is considered\u00a0oppression.","created_utc":1619678007000,"comment_id":"gw88byw","parent_id":"t3_n0qih4","score":146,"submission_id":"n0qih4"}

I\u2019ve read about how trans people often feel like their transition (whether physical, medical, or just presentation-wise) often feels like a second puberty, but as an adult. \n\nAs a woman, puberty was horrific. Yes, I had to walk the line between being a prude and a whore. I had to suffer through the relentless tormenting of unforgiving teenagers who would make my life a living hell if they even saw the glimpse of a pad in my backpack. I had to worry myself sick over whether the cramps I was feeling in class were just warning cramps or if I would have to make a hasty and shameful exit to the bathroom to prevent bleeding through my pants. I had to learn certain tricks like if I\u2019m worried a male teacher (or even female) wouldn\u2019t let me go to the bathroom if I asked, then I should just ask to go to the nurse who will always have extra pads and tampons handy. I had to learn what clothes I could get away with not wearing a bra, which ones needed a strapless bra, and which ones need a full coverage and support bra. Not wearing a bra with too thin a top meant the whole world would see my nipples, wearing a strappy bra with a sleeveless or backless dress meant the boys might take it as an invitation to snap my visible bra straps. I had to learn when and where it was ok to speak, when to hold my tongue, and what I could and could not speak about in certain spaces. I had to learn how to sit, stand and walk when wearing a skirt or high heels. I look back at photos of me at my 8th grade graduation in a silky white dress and kitten heels with my legs spread out, my shoulders hunched, and my smile crooked, and I cringe. I had to *learn* how to be a girl. \n\nNow it comes naturally. Which shade and brand of make up will match my skin without drying it out, how to blow dry my hair so my bangs don\u2019t flip up and look crazy all day, how to use a curling iron to get the perfect curl without burning my neck in the process, how to tell if a shoe is going to give me horrific blisters before even buying it, how to look confident and unapproachable, but not bitchy while sitting in a bar alone waiting for my friends to get there, how to recognize the look of \u201csave me from this creepy man\u201d from other women and how to give it when I need saving when in a bar or a club, the difference between casual, business casual, business professional, formal, cocktail, club, and black tie attire, and of course the right make up look to go with each. \n\nIt was hell to stumble through the unspoken rules making mistake after mistake and having to analyze the faces of those around me each time I messed up. It was hell, but I was 13. I hated my mother for telling me the truth. I hated her for warning me to be discreet when pulling a pad out of my bag. I hated her for telling me that my bright orange eyeshadow didn\u2019t look good. I hated her for asking if I was wearing *that* to school or for telling me I needed to shave my armpits if I wanted to wear a strapless dress. But at least I had a mother to tell me those things so that I wouldn\u2019t have to go out and face the judgmental teenagers and ignorant adults and older men who prey on young girls who don\u2019t know all the rules yet. \n\nI was 13. I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to learn all that from scratch, with no mother to help me navigate that minefield as a grown adult. On top of the fear of being ostracized by all my friends and family. I couldn\u2019t imagine.","created_utc":1619732216000,"comment_id":"gwam2kl","parent_id":"t3_n0qih4","score":15,"submission_id":"n0qih4"}

The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.\u201d Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti... \n\n> Today\u2019s color dictate wasn\u2019t established until the 1940s, as a result of Americans\u2019 preferences as interpreted by manufacturers and retailers. \u201cIt could have gone the other way,\u201d Paoletti says... \n\n> When the women\u2019s liberation movement arrived in the mid-1960s, with its anti-feminine, anti-fashion message, the unisex look became the rage\u2014but completely reversed from the time of young Franklin Roosevelt. Now young girls were dressing in masculine\u2014or at least unfeminine\u2014styles, devoid of gender hints. Paoletti found that in the 1970s, the Sears, Roebuck catalog pictured no pink toddler clothing for two years... \n\n> Gender-neutral clothing remained popular until about 1985. Paoletti remembers that year distinctly because it was between the births of her children, a girl in \u201982 and a boy in \u201986. \u201cAll of a sudden it wasn\u2019t just a blue overall; it was a blue overall with a teddy bear holding a football,\u201d she says. Disposable diapers were manufactured in pink and blue. \n\n> Prenatal testing was a big reason for the change. Expectant parents learned the sex of their unborn baby and then went shopping for \u201cgirl\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d merchandise. (\u201cThe more you individualize clothing, the more you can sell,\u201d Paoletti says.) The pink fad spread from sleepers and crib sheets to big-ticket items such as strollers, car seats and riding toys. Affluent parents could conceivably decorate for baby No. 1, a girl, and start all over when the next child was a boy... \n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/arts-culture\/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097\/) \n\nThis article doesn't mention it, but young children often played in white *dresses* not only because the white meant that they could easily bleach them once they got dirty, but because dresses allowed children the freedom of mobility that all children require when playing.","created_utc":1628973441000,"comment_id":"h8wk5mk","parent_id":"t3_p47948","score":159,"submission_id":"p47948"}

What does social construction mean? \n\n\nIt's impossible to differentiate between sex & gender or biology and upbringing or nature and nurture because upbringing and social factors influence biology. The contrast between genetic and environmental, between nature and nurture, is not a contrast between fixed and changeable. It is a fallacy of biological determinism to say that if differences are in the genes or brain or whatever, no change can occur.  [It is impossible to think of gene expression apart from the multiple environments in which it occurs. It is impossible to think of the manifestation of hereditary potential independently of the hierarchy of environments that shape its appearance. It is impossible to think of an organism that interacts with the environment without considering the genotypical uniqueness of that individual.

I believe modesty culture is toxic because it insinuates that women are inherently distracting sexual objects that need to be covered up. It suggests that in order to be respected, a woman must not reveal parts of her body. Those who defend such culture claim that modesty respects and elevates women because they are valued for their intellect and their personality rather than their physical appearance. ***Sorry, but the moment you make the connection between a woman\u2019s value\/respect and the kind of clothes she wears is the moment you have automatically disrespected her by reducing her to the clothes she wears.*** Additionally, I noticed modesty culture encourages victim-blaming because modesty culture suggests that women\/girls need to cover up so they do not distract men\/boys and invite unwanted harassment. Women, in my experience, have been compared to precious diamonds (suggesting that leaving a diamond out in the open tempts someone into grabbing and stealing it). ***To treat women like they are precious diamonds is to treat them like they are property.*** A woman is a woman, nothing more nothing less. Anyway, those who are responsible for harassment are the perpetrators and the perpetrators alone. Modesty culture shifts blame and responsibility onto those who have been victimized. Modesty culture is toxic and does not elevate women.

{"author":"misanthropy112","body":"I agree. I grew up in one of those hyper modest religions. I never understood what was so sexual about showing my knees or my shoulders.  It was always beaten into my brain that if I show too much skin that the men wouldn't be able to control their thoughts. I have a really hard time believing that if I show my knees that every man around me has a porno of me replaying in his head.  Why couldn't we just teach the men not to oogle and objectify women? Men do have control over their thoughts and actions. That is only teaching men that it's okay to not control your thoughts and actions around women showing skin because the women \"invite the attention. \" which is inherently a predatory way of thinking. The only woman that deserved respect  in that religion were the modest ones.\n\n It was always fine if the men were shirtless when they played sports but if wore short shorts to run a race in track I was sexualizing myself for men.\n\nI also hated the idea that keeping your virginity was the ultimate value of a woman.  Why are women supposed to only be as valuable as their bodies are to men? If men lose their virginity there's no way of knowing but there is with women so women end up being shamed.","created_utc":1620400815000,"comment_id":"gx8yd8t","parent_id":"t3_n6g5w0","score":3,"submission_id":"n6g5w0"}

{"author":"MonkeyFacedPup","body":"Ok, let\u2019s be real here. No one in this thread need try to appeal to whatever moderates or trolls here saying \u201cthese allegations are shaky\u201d or \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d These are NOT shaky allegations. None of them are. If they were, they wouldn\u2019t have big time lawyers representing them. Here are some big reasons:\n\n1. These women have absolutely NO MOTIVE TO LIE. They are practically random except for the fact that they went to school with Kavanaugh. They have absolutely nothing to gain from this, only to lose. These are all successful women who most likely will now be known mostly for this instead of their accomplishments. They\u2019re getting harassed and demonized by so many people. Blasey didn\u2019t even want to come out publicly and tried not to. The only possible lying motive is to stop him from becoming a Supreme Court Justice, but do we really think three different women are lying for this reason?? \n\n2. They are all describing the same culture of drinking and predatory behavior by this group Kavanaugh was a part of. It\u2019s also described by Mark Judge in his book. Plus Kavanaugh\u2019s planner even backs up this whole \u201cbeach week\u201d thing. Then there\u2019s his yearbook, which Kavanaugh has been downplaying tremendously, which has all these gross jokes about sexual conquest and binge drinking. Do we really think a \u201cRenate alumnus\u201d really refers to \u201chaving kissed her??\u201d We are all familiar with this kind of entitled rich boy party scene which so often includes predatory behavior. It still exists today. We have no reason to doubt it. \n\n3. Reliable witnesses always get small details from the past wrong. Police and prosecutors both know this. What\u2019s important is that the core elements of their stories are consistent, and in this case they are. \n\n4. There is a type for people who lie about being raped or assaulted. They\u2019re almost always serial liars and known to be unreliable. None of these women are that. \n\n5. There are many, many reasons the other witnesses don\u2019t want to corroborate the accusation even if they\u2019re true. There are very few reasons these women would lie. \n\nLook, either you think three different women are lying but are somehow still putting together a cohesive narrative about Brett\u2019s life that happen to have pretty big ties to his planner and yearbook and that Brett was this innocent choirboy they\u2019re trying to smear and they\u2019re willing to put up with all the terrible personal attacks for lies, or you believe Brett\u2019s lying to cover his ass. \n\nI think one of these takes is clearly a lot more rational.

Nobody can convince me this is about anything other than controlling women. Because, again, these same people who want to outlaw abortion want to restrict access to birth control. \n\nI just watched a heart rending episode of 'I Am A Killer', where a baby was dumped on his father because his mother didn't want him. His \"father\" sexually abused him, and passed him around to other men. He describes his earliest childhood memories of  being like a \"toy on a shelf\". Ignored until someone wanted to \"play\" with him. The abuse was finally discovered, and he was put in the system. He got fostered by a loving couple, who then had to give him up because the wife got a job out of state. He was then fostered by a single man, who again was wonderful to him. Until he officially adopted him. He then went on to sexually abuse the kid. This man lived down the street from his parents who the convict remembers as wonderful loving people. One day, he finally got up the courage to attempt to tell them about the abuse. He remembers nothing of the conversation or the events that followed. And ended up killing his foster grandparents brutally in a fit of misplaced blackout rage. I'm guessing they didn't believe him. He is now spending the rest of his life in prison. While his abuser - who had also adopted 2 more boys from the system, and had already started abusing one of them as well - lived his whole life free and died of natural causes.\n\nSo tell me how his being born benefited anyone?","created_utc":1582983422000,"comment_id":"fj2up70","parent_id":"t1_fj2i927","score":17,"submission_id":"fb0q3h"}

{"author":"Genzoran","body":"The Beast tends to be not just repulsive, but frightening and physically imposing. I think the heart of the story is the power dynamic: Beauty has to learn to appeal to the Beast, because she is otherwise powerless, and he has all the physical and institutional power. The Beast has to learn that true love is worthwhile even though it requires some vulnerability.\n\nYeah, it's a mirror to traditional marriage under patriarchy, where women have to make the best of a potentially unwanted or dangerous situation, and men get the opportunity to explore the benefits of a woman's domestic, emotional, and sexual labor.\n\nWe don't often see women as the Beast because the challenge of finding love with repulsive or physically frightening women is much less of an issue in society or the human experience. Without the institutional power imbalance, people just pass on relationships that don't interest them. The mythic potential of stories comes from widespread tension, so the stories about powerful but unattractive women (and attractive but powerless men) tend to be about other stuff, like finding ways to prove their worth.","created_utc":1748152629000,"comment_id":"mu2rssw","parent_id":"t3_1ku8bst","score":179,"submission_id":"1ku8bst"}

Human traits, behaviours and hobbies are not biologically wired to be either masculine or feminine. Women with careers are not masculine because having career is not a masculine thing. Having a career is a neutral human qualities.  Studying STEM, having career, working in agricultural sector, playing sports, caring for children are neutral human qualities that have been deliberately and forcefully classified as masculine and feminine. Because having a career boost one's economic independence, it had been classified as masculine. Caring for children had been leveled feminine because it doesn't improve one's economic situation. The classification has been done by men who wanted to subjugate women economically by making them economically vulnerable.  If you look beyond this classification, you would see that throughout most of the patriarchal history, both men and women perform similar tasks with one caveat -- men own lands and earn money while women didn't. In other words, femininity is devalued because men had constructed economical subjugation and intellectual inferiority as femininity.

[Sauce: https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/66\/wr\/mm6628a1.htm?s_cid=mm6628a1_w] \n\n\n>Perpetrators of sexual violence against transgender women are often known by the victim, in some instances they are romantic partners or family members. A 2005 study found that, out of the instances reported by the transgender men and women, 90% of the participants said that they had been sexually assaulted by a cisgender man. Around 30% of the participants also reported being sexually assaulted at some time by a cisgender woman and 16% reported being assaulted by another transgender individual (Again just like in the cases of cis women, perpetrators of sexual violences are overwhelmingly cis males and are often known by the victims)\n\nEdit: I stand by my interpretation.","created_utc":1626934663000,"comment_id":"h6235l0","parent_id":"t3_oovtmd","score":25,"submission_id":"oovtmd"}

Sex workers are financially incentivized to \"consent\" to acts they wouldn't otherwise agree to. This is, in my opinion, inherent to even the most ideal forms of sex work and can't be legislated away within our financial system.\n\nI've also read in studies that there is a correlation between exposure to violent pornography and sexual violence in adolescents. I don't know whether the same is true for adults. But the easy access to violent pornography on the internet in light of that correlation is concerning imo.\n\nI currently don't have any strong opinions on \"private\" BDSM since I don't understand the topic very well. A friend who's into kink has told me that ideally the submissive would be in complete control of any situation, but I'd imagine those lines can get blurry in practice, especially when the dominant participant is stronger, or has more power in the relationship.  \nDoes anyone know of any good books on kink from a feminist perspective?","created_utc":1617295544000,"comment_id":"gt0dh1o","parent_id":"t3_mhka1z","score":87,"submission_id":"mhka1z"}

{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":"The wage gap has not been eliminated, according to economists. Yes, it can be explained. So, what are these explanations ---- \n\n1. Pregnancy and childbirth, and child care ( males are good at avoiding child care. Misogynistic maternity leave  policy and society's refusal to accept pregnancy and childbirth as a form of labour, lack of access to health care, stigmatisation of breastfeeding). Misogyny is mostly responsible. \n\n2. Women are less likely to pursue Physics, Engineering, Economics, Computer Science. Sexist gender stereotypes, rise of fake feminism, e.g, choice feminism, and mythical beliefs about biological differences between sexes are fully responsible. So, misogyny. \n\n3. Women dominated sectors, e.g, education, health, services, are valued less than male dominated capitalistic friendly sectors. Why is this? Pure misogyny. Yes, only a misogynistic soceity can devalue education and health. \n\n4. Women are more likely to suffer from autoimmune disorder, painful periods, PCOS, migraines, IBS etc. All of these can affect a woman's education, career, salaries and wages negatively. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2018\/06\/180605103427.htm\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24793874\/\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2018\/04\/180423085434.htm\n\n\n5. Sexist social norms and practices, e.g, fear of male violence, purity culture, early marriage etc...\n\n\n6. Capitalistic structure of work place.                     Capitalism = Sexism+Misogyny \n\n7. Extreme dehumanization of LGBTQIA women. Again, misogyny. \n\nSo, the conclusion is gendered wage gap can be explained by misogynistic practices. \n\nAnyway, you are blocked because I won't let you drain my energy.","created_utc":1565620749000,"comment_id":"ewnv239","parent_id":"t1_ewnp7jd","score":10,"submission_id":"cp0euf"}

I read that a female's body can not fully handle being pregnant until they are 16, so I think for safety females 15 and under should not be having sex at all. Preferably guys would do the same. But according to this post females' bodies cannot fully, fully handle being pregnant until they are 20.

This gives you much more leverage in your relationships not to put up with whatever you see as BS from your partners that would be harder to do it you were a housewife that had no income or savings. \n\nThe malicious capitalism side of it is that everyone needs to work now because the amount a typical man used to get paid has been dropping since the 1980s so if you\u2019re say an average engineer now you make way less than an average engineer did in the 80\u2019s (this doesn\u2019t apply to women because they\u2019ve been increasingly successful at getting any job that isn\u2019t a housewife so average income goes up) meaning that traditional jobs which could once support a single household can\u2019t anymore so you can work with a partner and support a household but you can\u2019t be a single income household anymore. \n\nIf everyone had roughly the same pay as the 80\u2019s then it would probably be way more common for some men to start being house husbands now along with some women being housewives but they don\u2019t so everyone works","created_utc":1720741603000,"comment_id":"lcous8d","parent_id":"t1_lckbtp5","score":9,"submission_id":"1e03osp"}

{"author":"Jasonstackhouse111","body":"A huge part of my career was spent researching the relationship between poverty, lack of government services and crime.  Most crime is driven by economic strain and lack of resources.  But, not all.  There are violent crimes like this that have other motivations.\n\nLong and harsh sentences do not act as deterrents.  This is true even for violent crimes with their roots outside of poverty, like sexual assault, murder, etc.  IF harsh sentences were deterrents, then US states with the death penalty would have few murders.  This is not true at all.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that in some cases, long prison sentences are not warranted.  Society sometimes needs to be protected from predators.\n\nThese rapists need to be isolated from society.  For a long time, or even *forever*.  Not just the orchestrator of these acts.  Every one of these rapists needs to be imprisoned until they are too physically old to be a threat to anyone, which probably means until they die.  This wasn't a case of men coming over thinking they were having a threesome with a couple.  They KNEW that she was being drugged and offered up to be raped by her husband.  They had explicit conversations about it.  Many of them expressed their envy of her husband and his actions.\n\nEvery one of them is a violent criminal and the world needs to be protected from every one of them, forever.","created_utc":1734644191000,"comment_id":"m2tjjh2","parent_id":"t3_1hhr4zb","score":176,"submission_id":"1hhr4zb"}

{"author":"imbyath","body":"I definitely agree that above all, women should have the right to choose what they wear (obviously). However, we should also consider _why_ she is making these choices - women are constantly being influenced by society. \n\nWomen who wear certain clothes that show a lot of skin sometimes look physically uncomfortable in my opinion (e.g. wearing a crop top and a tiny skirt on a freezing cold day) and I question _why_ they made that choice. Would they be freezing their butts off if they were alone? Are they really dressing like thag for themselves? Or are they doing it for the male gaze, as women are so often pressured into looking perfect for men. \n\nAs for women wearing hijabs, if they're comfortable, then that's great. In really hot weather when the sun beats down on your head, a headscarf can cool you and protect you against the sun. But loads of women ARE pressured into feeling like they have to wear it. For example, if a mother tell her 7 year old daughter to start wearing a headscarf, then the girl may be fine with that, and even like it. But when she becomes much older, she may want to dress like her peers, or look sexy, or maybe she doesn't even believe in God anymore so she doesn't care for the garment. Of course, it's highly socially unacceptable to actually remove your headscarf, and the girl's decision would definitely be questioned by her family (whether she's 14 or 18 or 30 years old). So for this woman, the way she dresses may feel the opposite of empowering for her.","created_utc":1537325044000,"comment_id":"e67jf5b","parent_id":"t3_9gubox","score":2,"submission_id":"9gubox"}

{"author":"lacroixblue","body":"Are the Australian groups who oppose decriminalization of abortion also opposed to hormonal birth control? Because that\u2019s how it is in the US. Seriously though, in the US there is not a single pro life nonprofit that uses its funding\/resources to promote hormonal birth control. The closest I\u2019ve found is Secular Pro Life, and they acknowledge that birth control is proven to be the most effective way to decrease abortion but take no position on it and refrain from using funding\/resources to increase access to hormonal birth control. \n\nI have interacted with pro-life protesters at women\u2019s clinics (where I was an escort for the patients). I genuinely wanted to understand where they\u2019re coming from. The protesters I talked to weren\u2019t able to explain why they are against hormonal birth control.\n\nI did talk to one woman protesting who that she\u2019s okay with hormonal birth control but that it shouldn\u2019t be covered by health insurance, especially not Medicaid. (For non-Americans: Medicaid is the US government health insurance for low income people and is only available to low income adults in half the states). \n\nShe agreed that free or reduced cost hormonal  birth control does lower the abortion rate but said that it\u2019s too problematic and dangerous to promote. I guess my point is that even when I\u2019ve tried to engage with pro life people I\u2019m just left more confused. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. If you think people are murdering babies, wouldn\u2019t you be okay with paying for hormonal birth control since you know it decreases the number of what you view to be baby murders? Free hormonal birth control is also a fiscally conservative policy because it saves taxpayers $5 for every $1 spent.","created_utc":1566631507000,"comment_id":"exvn4t0","parent_id":"t1_ext2iem","score":6,"submission_id":"cucpqu"}

Please stop confusing anti-Muslim hate or bigotry that people experience in non-Muslim countries and check your fragility. Stop referring to it as an irrational fear of Islam because we have a very rational fear of Islam.\n\nIf you call yourself a feminist, then be ok with criticizing patriarchal religions, including Islam. Why should Islam even get a free pass? We ExMuslim women leave this religion for some of these very reasons, because we experience the sexism and misogyny first hand based on sexist and misogynist beliefs, practices and purity rules made by 7th century men for men. They weren\u2019t made for women and girls. \n\nRepresentation of women is all about wives and mothers in Islam. No prophets, caliphs, imams or jurists are or were women. Men are assumed to be de facto leaders and decision-makers. The Quran and Hadith are all written from the male perspective without women\u2019s voices or choices included. Not like women voted to be beaten if they didn\u2019t listen to their husbands but that\u2019s in the Quran. Not like they voted to wear the hijab or veil, but that\u2019s clearly brought onto women by men, again Prophet and his incel posse making these decisions for us and making it a part of Islam. Just so they could tell the difference between believing and non-believing, enslaved and free women. It\u2019s up to our Muslim family elders and Islamic government leaders to ensure women and girls have access to their rights, opportunities and freedoms.

Together, Gallo and Wong-Staal published more than 100 papers in 20 years, according to an article by the\u00a0NCI, and a 1990 article in\u00a0The Scientist\u00a0credits her as being the most-cited woman in science during the 1980s, earning 7,772 citations in academic journals. Wong-Staal was inducted into the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame last year for her contributions to the field.\"\n\n\"During her time in Gallo\u2019s lab, Wong-Staal was part of the group that identified the first human retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and showed that it could cause cancer. While it was already known that retroviruses replicated by inserting their genetic material directly into the genome of their hosts, scientists of the day were skeptical that these viruses could cause cancer in humans. \u201cAt the time, the dogma was that [human tumor viruses] did not exist,\u201d Wong-Staal said in a\u00a01997 oral history, adding that the lab was often criticized in its search for \u201crumor\u00a0viruses.\u201d' \n\n\"In the early 1980s, when AIDS cases first began appearing in alarming numbers, Wong-Staal was uniquely poised to study the emerging epidemic\u2014HIV, the virus that causes the disease, turned out to be a retrovirus. A team led by Gallo shared the co-discovery of HIV with the French scientist Luc Montagnier, and Wong-Staal provided the molecular evidence needed as proof. In 1985, she would become the first person to clone HIV and begin studying the functions of its genes, a necessary step towards developing eventual treatments.\"\n\n\u201cIt was the promise of developing treatments for the disease that finally drew Wong-Staal away from the NCI in 1990, when she joined UC San Diego to launch the new\u00a0Center for AIDS Research. Under her leadership, the center would emerge as one of the world\u2019s authorities in the field. The drug cocktails used today to manage AIDS stem from Wong-Staal\u2019s studies of the variations in the virus\u2019s genetic material. Later, with her second husband Jeffrey McKelvy, she co-founded a biopharmaceutical company called Immusol (later renamed iTherX Pharmaceuticals) to continue developing therapies for diseases such as hepatitis C.\"","created_utc":1595357284000,"comment_id":"fyr5cc0","parent_id":"t3_hv54gu","score":27,"submission_id":"hv54gu"}

{"author":"46264338327950288419","body":"Despite being a South Korean, I am not knowledgeable when it comes to gendered schools. And I really dont mean to be antanogistic here. I'm just wondering why the schools *NEED* to remain gendered?\n\nI don't like how the majority of public high schools here are gendered. Whether you graduated from a gendered or coed high school, so many people use them to justify gender essentialism (or vice versa) which always drives me mad.\n\nTrans laws here are shit, barely even existing. There's no need for the women's uni to ever have to consider whether they will allow only legal women to attend or only ban legal men from attending, since we only recognize two genders. \n\nAt the end of the day though, I guess I'm just personally butthurt. I'm a trans woman. College applications here is a hellish nightmare (not like it's a breeze elsewhere), and I still remember being straight up barred from even applying to any of the women's universities. I guess it sounds really petty and childish now that I type it out, but at the time I was stressed and it made me very sad.\n\nI'm currently studying at a coed uni which isn't too far from a women's uni. I've been on campus a few times. Nothing really stops me from signing up for and attending seminars held at the women's uni. Our school even has a program that allows me to sign up for courses at the women's uni. But something I find odd is that the women's uni has foreign exchange student programs with coed schools. How does that work? Do they only accept \"male\" students' applications? Also why are there still male professors? Confused on how exactly all that works.\n\nAnyway, the way the school and police responded is fucking disgusting, and I will see if there will be any protests I can attend. I'm just genuinely curious why an exclusively female school needs to exist, if that makes sense (even if they were trans-accepting). I really don't mean to come off as whiny.","created_utc":1731371869000,"comment_id":"lwlor3o","parent_id":"t3_1gosa0n","score":-153,"submission_id":"1gosa0n"}

You know assuming the heroine stands up against the violence or degradation and so on. \n\nI do agree with another thread, we shouldn't kink shame but perhaps you draw the line somewhere around let's say, rape? \n\nRegarding books, is the solution that we just censor books that have such topics in them as if to ignore that rape doesn't occur in reality?\n\nI don't think censorship does anything for the dialogue. I think it's the authors not a filter on a website that should be evaluated. It's more important to look at the content in the books based on how they explore the subject matter. I.e do they rationalize and glorify sexual violence against women or choose to expose the immorality\/criminality of it. \n\nMarital rape in undeveloped countries is not occurring because of violence against women is \"groomed\" in  video games or niche rape erotica. \n\nIn countries like India it's based on broken power dynamics where women are not seen as sexual equals. In some cultures, fulfilling your husband sexually is seen as a woman's duty - but not the other way around. \n\nI am sorry, I disagree - It's not popular culture that gives way to Marital rape or rape in general. Popular media, I find has come a long way and is the most sensitive to women's issues as ever. \n\nMost studies show that there is a disparity between generations. The newer gen is more aware and condemning towards what constitutes as violent or sexual abuse towards both genders.","created_utc":1590132587000,"comment_id":"fre86yu","parent_id":"t3_go52mc","score":50,"submission_id":"go52mc"}

{"author":"OohHeyItsSaffy","body":"If you think Reddit is bad check out Facebook. I accidentally joined a tradwife group ( I thought it was for sourdough bread making). The stuff they say is wild. Here is an exchange a from yesterday: \n\n\u201cJust remember that feminism is a corruption of what is good and right. It is an evil that has taken root that the devil is using to destroy the family and these women who suffer from it are ill. No need to say anything to them, just ignore them and move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's pretty wacky. Feminist ideologies include the vote, owning property, getting money from banks, and these things were not readily given. Working if you were married was outlawed, even if you were destitute. You could not work if pregnant. Widows and children were destitute. We have come a long way because women fought for basic civil protections that because of systemic subjugation they did not have.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Person who replied)  It no longer represents those things because those things are no longer an issue. Now it represents abortion as the ONLY choice, prostitution as a viable career, climbing the executive ladder while persecuting men, and vilifying any woman who does not agree. Feminism has outlived its usefulness.\u201d\n\nThe group is a lot of younger women looking for advice from older women on how to keep a home. There is a pretty big group of older women really pushing these ideals. My grandma has even said to me \u201cwomen don\u2019t let men be men anymore\u201d it\u2019s so bizarre. I think a lot of it comes down to religious isolation and fear of change coupled with the click bait media. You see a lot of right wing media pushing a huge anti trans agenda. When you are isolated and only hear those things from people you trust around you, it\u2019s easy to get sucked in. Then you join social media groups with huge amount of people reaffirming those beliefs which makes them more comfortable sharing which then recruits more people.","created_utc":1711571802000,"comment_id":"kwsey26","parent_id":"t3_1boznwc","score":65,"submission_id":"1boznwc"}

They can have big noses and bald spots and wrinkles and still be fully realized human beings, who are understood to feel a spectrum of emotions and thoughts.\n\nOf course everyone feels the pressure of beauty standards, but no one can tell me that men and women feel it equally. A women\u2019s worth is inseparable from her appearance. People will see an middle-aged woman with a certain haircut and say she is mean and stupid.

{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":">Toward the beginning in the shift to civilization, an early product of domestication is patriarchy: the formalization of male domination and the development of institutions which reinforce it. By creating false gender distinctions and divisions between men and women, civilization, again, creates an \u201cother\u201d that can be objectified, controlled, dominated, utilized, and commodified. This runs parallel to the domestication of plants for agriculture and animals for herding, in general dynamics, and also in specifics like the control of reproduction. As in other realms of social stratification, roles are assigned to women in order to establish a very rigid and predictable order, beneficial to hierarchy. Woman come to be seen as property, no different then the crops in the field or the sheep in the pasture. Ownership and absolute control, whether of land, plants, animals, slaves, children, or women, is part of the established dynamic of civilization. Patriarchy demands the subjugation of the feminine and the usurpation of nature, propelling us toward total annihilation. It defines power, control and dominion over wildness, freedom, and life. Patriarchal conditioning dictates all of our interactions; with ourselves, our sexuality, our relationships to each other, and our relationship to nature. It severely limits the spectrum of possible experience. The interconnected relationship between the logic of civilization and patriarchy is undeniable; for thousands of years they have shaped the human experience on every level, from the institutional to the personal, while they have devoured life. To be against civilization, one must be against patriarchy; and to question patriarchy, it seems, one must also put civilization into question. \n\n-- Green Anarchy\u00a0collective\n\n\n>Food must be cooked, clothes cleaned, beds made, wood chopped. Housework is therefore a key element in the process of the reproduction of the laborer from whom surplus value is taken. Since it is usually women who do housework, it has been observed that it is through the reproduction of labor power that women are articulated into the surplus-value nexus which is the sine qua non of capitalism. It can be further argued that since no wage is paid for housework, the labor of women in the home contributes to the ultimate quantity of surplus value realized by the capitalist. But to explain women\u2019s usefulness to capitalism is one thing. To argue that this usefulness explains the genesis of the oppression of women is quite another. It is precisely at this point that the analysis of capitalism ceases to explain very much about women and the oppression of women.","created_utc":1608852335000,"comment_id":"ggwkhoa","parent_id":"t3_kjec31","score":48,"submission_id":"kjec31"}

Her husband admitted her to Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) on March 27 where she was kept in the emergency ward.\n\nLater, on April 1, on being suspected to be coronavirus patient, she was kept in an isolation ward. Her family members alleged that it was in this isolation ward where a doctor attending to her overnight outraged her modesty for two successive nights on April 2 and 3.\n\n\u201cThe following day, she was discharged from the hospital after her coronavirus test report was found to be negative. However, after returning home, she remained aloof and struck by fear. On questioning, she revealed how a doctor had sexually abused her in the isolation ward. On April 6, she passed away due to excessive bleeding,\u201d said her mother-in-law.\n\nOn receiving the information, the local police asked the mother-in-law to come to the hospital on Tuesday and identify the doctor (about whom the victim had given a description). However, the accused was not identified.\n\n\u201cPrima facie, the matter is serious. We are verifying the allegations. We will dig out the CCTV footage in the hospital and take strict action after identifying the culprit,\u201d said Dr VK Prasad, the hospital superintendent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gaya police have arrested two people who posed as doctors and entered the isolation ward using doctors\u2019 kits.

{"author":"MistWeaver80","body":"\n\nFeminists use \"womxn\" to denounce the sexism and male supremacy inherent in the standard spelling\u2014which contains and derives from the word\u00a0man as if man is the default. The word women or woman reflects patriarchal mindset that argued that women are mini men. That is, there's no physiological difference between men and women but there is a huge difference in male and female brain, making female   the inferior man species under the guise of science (and that's why they refused to include women in medical trials, but keep publishing neurosexist garbages). To expand: the word \"woman\" is no different than Aristotle saying that women were suited to a subordinate social position because they were a sort of lesser biological mutation of men, or early evolutionary psychologists saying that women were suited to a subordinate social position. And that's why we can't say mxn. Contrary to whatever you read in neoliberal rag, the word \"womxn\" has nothing to do with trans women or intersectionality because the word \"woman\" is already inclusive of trans women. That is, women\u00a0already includes trans women. \n\nPeople throw women under the bus under a knee-jerk \"inclusivity\/intersectional feminism\" guise and it hurts cis women but also very directly trans women when you try to create a subcategory of \"womxn\" that essentially reads as \"women but different\" which is transmisogynist and just plain misogynist. It creates a patriarchal dichotomy that defines cis women as biological women (true women) and trans women non-biological women (false women). However, women (cis or trans) are not biological women, sex or gender. Rather they are defined, marked and controlled by these constructions. Instead of letting them define trans women as false women (so that trans women could be subjugated), stop them from defining cis women as true women -- their definition of true women are still keeping women in a subjugated state.","created_utc":1614922034000,"comment_id":"gpp8huc","parent_id":"t3_lxv9ta","score":47,"submission_id":"lxv9ta"}

They want to get closer and closer to real life, toeing the line. Studio porn isn\u2019t enough anymore. They want home video. That\u2019s not enough anymore. Now they want cam girls to wear pigtails and pretend they\u2019re their naughty daughter. I read a thread on that yesterday. It was asking women who regretted porn why they started doing it and why they left it. So many women talked about how creepy 70+% of the clientele were and would ask for questionable content. They wondered if these men had acted on the lines they were toeing them with them and ultimately said they found it hard to trust men now. I say they\u2019re close at the very least. That\u2019s how addiction works. If your porn abuse has led you to cam girls you\u2019re addicted.

Let alone anything else.\n\nIf universal healthcare passed in the United States, and my reproductive rights were SECURED, I'd get pregnant TODAY. But as it stands, even with insurance, I'm looking at 10k MINIMUM just to give birth (and this is for a healthy birth), we make too much for government assistance. I have a disorder that may make it so that I need a C-Section, so make it even more expensive. Then there will be all the other medical needs of my child, if they have any disabilities that will add to the cost. Childcare isn't even a thought, I run my job and my own company remotely and my spouse is trying to do the same, we'd be home for our baby. But our tax rate is through the fucking roof thanks to Trump's policies. And then there's preparing for the baby with pumps, bottles, clothing, books, cribs, high chairs, formula, toys (yes, TOYS, baby toys actually help with their development), strollers, etc. Even if I got all of this secondhand (which I plan on doing), it costs.  \n\n\nAnd living in poverty AFFECTS CHILDREN NEGATIVELY. My husband is a teacher in a rural county. He SEES WHAT IS HAPPENING to these kids, especially the ones in big families where they are being parentified. It is unhealthy AND LEADING TO THESE PEOPLE NOT WANTING CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN. \n\nEvery other point in that comment section is fucking moot. as long as healthcare cost and women's healthcare is in the fucking shitter, as long as climate change keeps rearing its head, as long as our children's education continues to be devalued, people will continue to have fewer children or no children at all.\n\nWe are most likely just going to foster if this shit keeps up.","created_utc":1655352431000,"comment_id":"ichw5hh","parent_id":"t3_vd2dot","score":347,"submission_id":"vd2dot"}

{"author":"lizziemander","body":"Some reasons our ancestors had that many kids:\n\n1) Birth control was not widely available. You had the \"pull out method\" (roll them dice, baby,) or condoms which were made of the intestines of animals (like putting a sausage casing on your... uh... sausage.) Not particularly reliable. \n\n2) There WAS sometimes a religious aspect to the size of families, especially Catholic (I'm my family's amateur genealogist, and DAMN could my Irish ancestors make babies.) Some wives were bred back to back until they died. Often, that baby they tried to have at 48 years old did them in. Women were chattel. \n\n3) If you had a farm, you needed a LOT of help. The more sons you spawned, the better your chances of surviving off the land.\n\n4) And finally, it was widely understood a percentage of your children wouldn't live to adulthood, so it made sense to have a heckin' amount of kids. Oregon Trail wasn't just trolling when it said \"You have died of dysentery.\"\n\nMassive broods had *nothing* to do with being a joy and a privilege. That's not to say that there weren't large families who loved one another, but this is simply another example of conservatives being willfully ignorant of history -- and doomed to repeat it at everyone else's expense.\n\nPLEASE show me a single person on that absurd sub who has more than four kids.

(Hence most girls we see go pro only participate in 1v1 competitions, things structured more like chess. )\n\nAnd beyond that obviously the cultural value narratives support male athletes way more in their childhood beyond a few choice sports.(which often just so happens to feature women in short skirts performing aesthetically) \n\nEquality in sport is a very complex topic and many people like to look at the outcome of the system and justify the flawed unjust system itself.\n\nBut it's rarely about individuals, it's about statistics and large numbers.\n\nBefore anyone strawmans me here. Are there justifyiable  reasons for gendered leagues in some sports that help women perform on a higher level and have better opportunities? Of course. And it can be a great tool to work towards more equallity **if** there is actual interest in achieving that.

In olympic powerlifting, for example, the most elite female athletes are usually hundreds of pounds below the most elite males in the same sport. The world record deadlift by a female athlete is a little under 700lbs, whereas the world record male DL is 1100+. \n\nI like what you said on separation of skill instead of sex, but in a few sports (like the one I just mentioned) I think that could be unfair to the women athletes who train for their whole lives and reach insane levels of performance only to be \"bested\" by men who, simply put, have a higher plateau due to genetic & hormonal advantages.

{"author":"Adventurous_Fly_4420","body":"It's too bad this is so quickly dismissed by so many people. Language is so essential to the narratives we tell about our experiences. Jackson Katz made an excellent point about the problematic language used so often regarding gender violence. He spoke at a TEDxFiDiWomen talk in 2013 about how gender violence is first a men's issue, and that men are constantly being removed from the picture, even by the simplest of terminology. Language like \"Gender\", \"Race\", and \"Sexual Orientation\" often get seen\/heard as \"Women\", \"African American\/Latin\\[x\\]\/Asian\", and \"Gay\/Lesbian\/Bisexual\", while the dominant groups are utterly ignored, and so their dominance is not made part of the default concept. The notion that \"Gender\" doesn't include men, or \"Race\" doesn't include white, or \"Sexual Orientation\" doesn't include heterosexual, unless we get people to notice the predominance of those groups (which is why it's so fun to ask \"when did you first come out as straight?\").\n\nIn that talk there's a point where Katz illustrates (at about [4:08](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KTvSfeCRxe8?t=248)) one way gender violence gets erased from our language with a very simple example from [Julia Penelope](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Julia_Penelope) (Lesbian Theorist, Linguist and Feminist):\n\n>Start with \"John beat Mary\" (straightforward)  \n>  \n>Becomes \"Mary was beaten by John\" (passive, focus on Mary)  \n>  \n>Becomes \"Mary was beaten\" (ignoring John's role completely  \n>  \n>Becomes \"Mary was battered\" (softening the term)  \n>  \n>Becomes \"Mary is a battered woman\" (utterly altering Mary's identity).\n\nThis is essentially a subtle form of victim blaming. It's a very important issue to look at language. We need more questions and language about the role of men in gender violence. Why does John beat Mary? Why is John abusive perhaps to *other* people in his life? Why do so many men rape? Why do they rape women, or men, or trans people, or children? Why are these things a problem all over the world?\n\nLanguage is how we talk about these things, and the clarity of calling things what they actually are is critical to those discussions.","created_utc":1664255084000,"comment_id":"iq0scti","parent_id":"t3_xo83jn","score":6,"submission_id":"xo83jn"}

If you're so pissed about not being like the girls on tv, how about you change what you look like?\" i had gone 6 days without eating.\n\nso we made it up. we gave barbie a cape and our spotted dog the ability to control the weather. we wrote barely-legible fanfiction about vampires who were also terribly in love with us - because we were perfect in this world, unlike the mess of what really was - we crafted entire sub- stories about how the main characters in our favorite universes were secretly girls in disguise. we made 1 7-year-old characters who would cut the throats of anyone who hurt them. we drew pictures of women in full, angry armor. we wrote bad poems about the girls we loved and the ones we were jealous of. we hurt ourselves often, were excellent at denying ourselves in the name of something. we only ate salad, we wouldn't touch grease, we didn't buy certain things, didn't get dirty. we used things to fill the gaps. bath bombs. fussy boots. venti iced mocha half-caf.\n\nwe made it up. we flooded the market. we put up pictures of ourselves smiling, with messy hair and silly faces, with back fat, with smudged makeup. we made videos perfecting our lips. we made art of possible fashion - all with pockets.\n\na few girls take selfies at a sports event. they are slandered across the news for it.\n\ncan you imagine? can you imagine the selfishness? the audacity? the self-possession one must feel to take a picture of themselves where they control everything?\n\nwe don't belong. images of us have to be photoshopped. made in buildings with perfect lighting. a young girl in underwear. we don't belong. we don't exist. keep quiet. if you don't like it, don't look at it.\n\n---\n\n^^I'm&#32;a&#32;human&#32;volunteer&#32;content&#32;transcriber&#32;for&#32;Reddit&#32;and&#32;you&#32;could&#32;be&#32;too!&#32;[If&#32;you'd&#32;like&#32;more&#32;information&#32;on&#32;what&#32;we&#32;do&#32;and&#32;why&#32;we&#32;do&#32;it,&#32;click&#32;here!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TranscribersOfReddit\/wiki\/index)","created_utc":1618264921000,"comment_id":"gu96wmj","parent_id":"t3_mpe3or","score":148,"submission_id":"mpe3or"}

{"author":"Sad_Quote_3415","body":"Has anyone been noticing this pattern of \"if you don't like it, just don't look at it\"?. Notice how it's always men telling oppressed and silenced groups the same thing, in different formats. Even with the pandemic, I've been hearing this a lot and it sounds so familiar to what I've always heard from men when tried to bring attention to the fact women get SA at epidemic proportions. They say \"if you are afraid, just stay home\". That's how they solve it. They don't care if the system that lifts them up, shuts people down, as long as they keep on winning. They have no worry. It doesn't affect them, so it's not of their concern. It's so extremely hypocritical that you even see men justifying not wearing a mask with \"my body my choice\", then they go around and tell women what to do with their bodies.\n\nAnd that does make me feel like I don't belong. Like I have no voice. Like I have no space.\n\nPs I am relating to the pandemic not only because I've been told many times similar things by antimaskers as well as by MRAs, but also because I was just reading [this study](https:\/\/www.fdu.edu\/news\/fdu-poll-finds-masculinity-is-a-major-risk-factor-for-covid-19\/) yesterday about how masculinity and not wearing a mask intercepts.","created_utc":1618279157000,"comment_id":"gua2s9j","parent_id":"t3_mpe3or","score":68,"submission_id":"mpe3or"}
{"author":"lishmunchkin","body":"It\u2019s awful how true this is. One thing I have been doing to take back my body image and sexuality is learning pole dance. I know that sounds counter intuitive, but hear me out. There are lessons available where they teach adult women the art of pole dance. NOT stripping, just the dancing. Men are not allowed. It\u2019s a space where you can get a full body workout with other women. You can learn to move sexy and build confidence. It\u2019s meant to do it for yourself, not for anyone else. If there\u2019s not a studio close to where you live, you can find lessons online. You can get a pole for your home and do it yourself. That\u2019s what I did. I go in the other room, close the door, and I do my dancing. Hubby is not allowed in. I told him it\u2019s only for me. And I feel so good about myself afterwards. I\u2019m not a skinny girl, I\u2019m curvy. But something about breaking that taboo of pole dancing and learning it and doing it feels so empowering to me.

Then when I was in 6th grade we had a week of science classes addressing actual sex with anatomy lessons.  In 7th grade we finally had a more in-depth two week unit on anatomy, sex, contraception options, and STDs with the last two days the teachers answering anonymous questions from classmates (everyone was required to write either questions\/statements or just hi! on little pieces of paper put into a box that was passed around in the hopes that those not comfortable talking in front of others would still be given the chance to have their concerns addressed).  Sadly, my school district did not allow the teachers to speak in any manner regarding gender identity or sexual identity or basically any noncis hetero mentions (even though some of them were more than open to).

By creating false gender distinctions and divisions between men and women, civilization, again, creates an \u201cother\u201d that can be objectified, controlled, dominated, utilized, and commodified. This runs parallel to the domestication of plants for agriculture and animals for herding, in general dynamics, and also in specifics like the control of reproduction. As in other realms of social stratification, roles are assigned to women in order to establish a very rigid and predictable order, beneficial to hierarchy. Woman come to be seen as property, no different then the crops in the field or the sheep in the pasture. Ownership and absolute control, whether of land, plants, animals, slaves, children, or women, is part of the established dynamic of civilization. Patriarchy demands the subjugation of the feminine and the usurpation of nature, propelling us toward total annihilation. It defines power, control and dominion over wildness, freedom, and life. Patriarchal conditioning dictates all of our interactions; with ourselves, our sexuality, our relationships to each other, and our relationship to nature. It severely limits the spectrum of possible experience. The interconnected relationship between the logic of civilization and patriarchy is undeniable; for thousands of years they have shaped the human experience on every level, from the institutional to the personal, while they have devoured life. To be against civilization, one must be against patriarchy; and to question patriarchy, it seems, one must also put civilization into question. \n\n-- Green Anarchy\u00a0collective\n\n>\n\n\n>Food must be cooked, clothes cleaned, beds made, wood chopped. Housework is therefore a key element in the process of the reproduction of the laborer from whom surplus value is taken. Since it is usually women who do housework, it has been observed that it is through the reproduction of labor power that women are articulated into the surplus-value nexus which is the sine qua non of capitalism. It can be further argued that since no wage is paid for housework, the labor of women in the home contributes to the ultimate quantity of surplus value realized by the capitalist. But to explain women\u2019s usefulness to capitalism is one thing. To argue that this usefulness explains the genesis of the oppression of women is quite another. It is precisely at this point that the analysis of capitalism ceases to explain very much about women and the oppression of women.","created_utc":1609871982000,"comment_id":"gi62gmt","parent_id":"t3_kquzu7","score":95,"submission_id":"kquzu7"}

{"author":"flavius_lacivious","body":"I had a therapist do something similar. \n\nWe were headed for divorce, I was bringing up *major* problems in the marriage \u2014 mostly about how selfish and entitled my husband was and how he refused to help. This guy just really dug his feet in and I was at the end of my rope.\n\nThe (boomer-aged male) therapist spent 30 minutes discussing why my ex was upset with me that his dinner was served to him on a cold plate. No shit. That was my ex\u2019s \u201cbiggest complaint\u201d in the marriage.\n\nI worked full-time in the same job as my husband, I cooked a full sit-down meal every night (family dinner time was important to me) and I did 90% of the childcare and household duties. I managed everything for my ex. He not only did the weaponized incompetence thing, he just refused to help. He would not clean but expected a spotless home. He was never engaged in the marriage or family and resented ANY demands on his time. He used to get mad and punish me by hiding my things like my car keys or purse. (I never lost anything in any of the years after the divorce.)\n\nThe division of labor was never discussed by the therapist. The chores my ex was supposed to do and didn\u2019t were never discussed. His complete failure to be partner or a father never entered into the sessions. \n\nWe were paying this guy $200 an hour to discuss how my ex hated his dinner served to him on a cold plate and the therapist commiserating with his tale of woe. I was actually told to \u201csit quietly\u201d while the men-folk talked. \n\nThe therapist ended up telling my ex it was clear he needed therapy (presumably because I was such a bitch that I served him cold food) and set up a month of weekly appointments for him. I made the appointment for marriage counseling for both of us, but we were now very concerned about my ex\u2019s complaints that I left my shoes on the floor near the front door (I don\u2019t wear shoes in the house because it\u2019s gross) and how his grandfather died before he was born. Yep, I literally spent the first 5 minutes of the appointment talking about why we were there, the rest was about his sadness that he didn\u2019t get everything his own way.\n\nPissed off at this point. I laughed at the therapist and told him he was crazy if he thought my ex would actually show up for individual therapy. I asked him if he would like to make a wager on it because he would NOT be there. The therapist then turned to my ex who assured him he would show up. I reiterated to not make the appointments because he wouldn\u2019t show.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem in this marriage. He agrees to do something and then blows it off. That\u2019s why we are here.\u201d I was mad.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show, of course and refused to answer the therapist\u2019s calls. He didn\u2019t dare call me. The fucker tried to bill me for it, too since my name was on the account but I won that battle by telling him to refer to his notes where I said not to make the appointments. \n\nHow did I know? My ex couldn\u2019t find his ass with both hands if I didn\u2019t manage it for him, so I just didn\u2019t remind him. \n\nI got a female therapist who commented that there are a lot of bad therapists out there and by the end of the first session, we had a plan for the divorce since it wasn\u2019t obvious my ex was interested in being married and never had been, so why was I expecting a therapist to make him care? \n\nReal eye-opener.","created_utc":1692226191000,"comment_id":"jwfrhkw","parent_id":"t3_15skvn3","score":316,"submission_id":"15skvn3"}

Fathers who \u201csell\u201d their daughters to a husband, boyfriends\/husbands who rape and murder, uncles and community leaders who abuse. Even the certified protectors, cops, have high rates of dv.\n\nWhere are these men that have always protected women? They\u2019re literally the ones we need protection FROM.\n\nEven outside of the home, who is on alert for women being in danger? Who watches other women\u2019s drinks?

Providing time and mentorship to your kids. Providing emotional support to your family. Being a provider doesn\u2019t stop at just money. \n\n\nWomen are expected to provide care, both physical and emotional support. And in this day and age? Be able to provide financial support. Yet amongst guys, there still exists this mentality that the most they need to provide is just money.\n\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve always been sick of men\u2019s mentality that they are seen as the predominant protectors of the family. Women have been doing this for ages. Folks have no problem acknowledging mothers protecting their kin when it comes to the animal kingdom (the phrase \u201cmama bear\u201d comes to mind.)

{"author":"MavenBrodie","body":"One of the wildest exchanges I've had as a Mormon woman who deconstructed from the faith was an exchange on a Facebook real of an interview I did explaining the erasure I felt in the Mormon Temple ceremony during certain parts where women had to cover their faces with a veil while men didn't. \n\nIn the entirety of growing up, the only reason why parts of your body needed to be covered up on principle was for modesty and decency. And the parts where we had to cover our faces as women were supposedly the most sacred and special part of the whole ceremony. When I initially tried to ask why we did it the most common default answer was that it was about \"respect.\" It took me a while to be able to put words to the feeling, but it always hurt to do that every time I participated in the ceremony and initially I couldn't figure out why.\n\nSo this clip is me explaining several reasons all working together. One was the feeling of erasure, as all of us women are wearing the exact same clothes, and then with the thin veil over our faces we're being hidden, literally. Am I taking away our most defining characteristic, our faces, it just felt really depersonalizing. It also invoked a sense of isolation and separation from the other women around me who are also wearing their veils. \n\nPlus there was the aspect of decency and modesty and respect. These ceremonies were supposed to represent my relationship with God who I had been taught to see as a parental figure and so I struggled to see why I supposedly loving parent it would not want to see my face when interacting with me and that it would be a sign of respect to cover it, especially when it obviously wasn't a sign of respect for men to have to because they didn't. The obvious conclusion was that if wearing the veil was for respect then there was something disrespectful or inappropriate about my face.\n\nAnyway I had a Mormon man comment that I misunderstood the symbolism. (Oh, and one thing to note is that that is actually something the church has since modified, so while women still wear a veil during the temple ceremony there's no point where they have to pull it in front of their faces anymore) \n\nAnyway, I asked the man to go ahead and explain the symbolism to me and it quickly became obvious that until I had asked him that question, he never in his life time ever considered the women's experience or the why behind it like at all. Ever. Yet it was so natural for him to immediately correct me without even thinking that maybe, just maybe, as the person experiencing it, I did think about it quite a lot! Did that he was projecting his own ignorance on to me. \n\nHe came up with multiple excuses that I kept pushing back on and they were truly dumb. Like one was because women are more emotional and the veil would allow us to hide tears of Joy or sadness. Like what? We didn't even wear the veils the whole time so it made zero sense. \n\nParts of the temple ceremony involve watching pre-recorded videos in between different parts of the ceremony. So one of his symbolic guesses was that the veil allowed women time to adjust their eyes to the light changes from being turned off for the video and then turned back on when it was done. \n\nI think he did try to make one of his guesses a more spiritual one though I can't remember the argument but it doesn't matter anyway cuz it falls apart once you point out that it should have also applied to men when it didn't combined with the fact that it is not now part of the ceremony so if there was a spiritual reason behind it then that's a spiritual aspect that no longer part of the experience. \n\nThen he tried to say that that part got changed as something unnecessary and to streamline the ceremony but taking out the part telling women to now avail their faces and then later to say that they could now unveil their faces saves like one second of time lol. And I asked him to try not to be so confusing between deciding whether or not it was a really spiritual part of the ceremony or completely unnecessary or not. \n\nAnyway, by far those were the stupidest suggestions a man has ever tried to bring up about an aspect of my lived experience that he had zero fucking clue about","created_utc":1732097284000,"comment_id":"ly17sni","parent_id":"t3_1gvbmeq","score":122,"submission_id":"1gvbmeq"}

{"author":"MoonyTune","body":"This is a political cartoon, it's meant to be controversial so that it may stir up discourse.\n\nHere's the article behind the cartoon, since it seems to me you're solely commenting on the drawing and are unaware of the allegations. Unless you're willfully ignoring them in order to defend your icon. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/news\/1176905\/exposed-sweatshop-slaves-earning-just-44p-an-hour-making-empowering-beyonce-clobber\/\n\n>It's a hate based meme with an easy target (new wealth, celebrity, plays into misogyny \/ racism) \nDoes it include her 'girl power' slogan to imply an anti-feminist message, because that is what it would imply outside of feminist circles...\nIt makes a good shocking image to see Beyonc\u00e9 act as a slave master in spite of her being black and her music, such as Formation, which disavows such practices\n\nHer girl power slogan is included because of the hypocrisy of her actions. She's made an image of herself as this feminist powerhouse whose music is meant to empower women, but her actions - what she does with money she earns from her \"empowering music' is a direct contradiction. She went into business with [Sir Philip Green](https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/amp.theguardian.com\/global-development\/2020\/dec\/04\/philip-green-is-the-scrooge-who-haunts-millions-of-garment-workers), a billionaire known for taking shortcuts, who made his billions by exploiting vulnerable workers in developing countries. In business circles Green was well known for finding the cheapest chain suppliers and cutting corners wherever he could, chances of her having no idea or suspicions of who she was getting into business with are slim to none.\n\n>It actively alienates the 'bourgeois liberal feminists' by implying their ethical inferiority without providing a meaningful way to improve (\"oh, I don't like Beyonc\u00e9 anymore, that makes me sooo much more 'ethical'\")?\n\nI don't see anything wrong with alienating a subgroup of individuals who contribute to oppression and exploitation of others. If we're on the same page about \"conservative feminists\" not really being feminists for the same reasons, then there should be no debate about 'bourgeois liberal feminsts' either. \n\nWhy must it be a conservative attack, it could just as easily be a Marxist attack? But why does that matter? You're making the 'poisoning the well' logical fallacy here - it shouldn't matter who made the poster, when the poster itself makes a valid point.\n\n>Does it matter more to display your ethics and hurt the chances \/ timeline for them to be adopted into culture \/ regulations or would you prefer to make actual progress faster?\n\nWhat does this question even mean? Doing the right thing is what matters, not making it seem like you're doing the right things by writing songs about trendy topics. If you \"displaying\" your ethics is just a charade that doesn't match up to your actions, then you're just a hypocrite who says \"Do as I say and not as I do\", and we have enough of those already. If your actions hurt others, it doesn't matter if you're playing the \"long game\". \n\n>It ignores the complexity of the economic system she works in and tradeoffs she faces \n$0.64\/hr is not equivalent to slave labor in Sri Lanka to slave labor when it's above the $1.90\/day poverty line, a relevant statistic to Sri Lanka\n\nMAS controls their workers freedom of association and is known for union busting. Just because someone pays above the minimum wage and not at the poverty line that doesn't mean their employees aren't living in near poverty. \n\nThe living wage in Sri Lanka at the time this comic and story came out was 43,000 rupees, whereas Ivy Park employees made 18,000-21,000 rupees (depending on years worked) - not even half of what they'd need to make to live dignified lives in Sri Lanka. For reference, here's how much things cost in 2016:\n\n\"WHAT 902 rupees or \u00a34.30 a day goes on...\n\nMcDonald\u2019s meal: 650rupees (\u00a33.07).\n\nPint of beer: 200rupees (94p).\n\nLitre of milk: 150rupees (71p).\n\nLevi jeans: 3,900 rupees (\u00a318.41).\n\nTrainers: 8,000 rupees (\u00a337.74).\n\n1-bed flat rent monthly: 30,000 rupees (\u00a3141.51).\"\n\nMost of the workers lived in boarding homes, since their wages can't afford them anything more than a room - rooms which are often shared with their family.\n\nIt doesn't ignore the \"complexity of the economic system\", there's nothing complex about paying your employees reasonable wages. She contributes to a broken and predatory system which makes capital off of the backs of vulnerable communities. Just because other companies are guilty of it too, it doesn't absolve her off exploitation. That's just the \"what about\" fallacy, that we really got to quit making.\n\n>It insinuates that she uses sweatshops directly (ball and chain) \nAre they actually sweat shops?\n**Does she subcontract or does she actually oversee this operation?**\n\nDoes it matter? She's the founder of the company, it's on her to make sure her hiring practices and working conditions are ethical. Global supply chains are used specifically to detract attention and liability from the brands for their \"subcontracted\" sweatshop labour, so they can plead ignorance and vouch to do better, then subcontract other sweatshops in the future.\n\nDo you think women working more than 60hrs\/week and still being unable to afford to rent an apartment, barely scraping by isn't sweat inducing? Just because there are degrees to how terrible sweatshops can be, it doesn't make this ethical just because it's not as terrible as other sweatshops around the world.\n\n>Why not advocate for more regulations, tariffs, reform to make the clothes industry playing field more ethical instead of hating on those who provide goods you buy for making questionable choices?? \n\nWhy are these mutually exclusive? We should be shaming and boycotting those contributing to exploitation AND advocating for better regulations, tarrifs and reform. Which I would argue isn't only not mutually exclusive, but boycotting those who exploit is a form of advocating for reform.\n\n\n>Why not start your own brand based on ethics if you think they can actually make that choice as a single player in the clothes industry?\n\nBecause not all of us have millions lying in the bank account to start our own brands. And for those who have started their own brands with this specifically in mind - their brands are overshadowed and overlooked in favor of celebrity brands like this one. Sadly, most people (you seem to be in this camp too) don't care if their clothes are produced ethically or not, as long as there's a mega celebrity endorsing them.\n\n\nOverall point - using one's status as a \"feminist icon\" to promote a clothing brand that make profits from the exploitation of other women, should absolutely be called into question. \n\nThis comic does not overstep any boundaries - working more than 60hrs\/week to barely afford to live in a boardinghouse, sharing a room with your sister and still barely making ends meet, like one of the workers interviewed in the article has, while Beyonce and  Sir Philip Green make millions in profit, is nothing short of slave labour.\n\nEdit: now that you've found the article and realized it was a sweatshop, it's important to acknowledge had there been no backlash or criticism of Beyonce in the news for the hypocrisy captured in the cartoon, more than likely there wouldn't have been any changes made to the production processes of Ivy Park. They've only vowed to do better, because they were called out on it.","created_utc":1619908879000,"comment_id":"gwjmjfw","parent_id":"t1_gwje17x","score":66,"submission_id":"n2eb6j"}

{"author":"Yeahmaybeitsdetritus","body":"The vast majority of women who get an abortion \u2014 99 percent \u2014 feel that their choice was the correct decision five years later, a new study finds.\n\nResearchers at the University of California at San Francisco sought to track the emotions of women in the weeks, months and years after they have an abortion in a wide-ranging study of 667 women from 30 spots around the U.S., published Sunday in the journal Social Science & Medicine.\n\nIn addition to asking women if they made the correct decision, researchers asked the women more about their feelings beginning one week after their abortion and then twice a year for the next five years, finding that regardless of how they initially felt \u2014 positive or negative \u2014 those emotions lessened to a more neutral level over time.\n\nIn that first week, 51 percent of women had positive emotions about their abortion, 17 percent felt negative emotions, and 20 percent said they had none or few, The Washington Post reported. Five years later, 84 percent felt positive emotions or none at all about their abortion, just 6 percent felt negatively and there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of newly formed positive or negative emotions.\n\n\u201cA really interesting finding is how the intensity of all emotions is so low,\u201d said Corinne Rocca, lead author of the study and a UCSF associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, according to the Post.\nThe women also felt more confident in their decision to have an abortion. In the first week after their abortion, 95 percent of women felt that they had made the right decision, and five years later, it was up to 99 percent.","created_utc":1579135200000,"comment_id":"feh07my","parent_id":"t3_ep3sw1","score":105,"submission_id":"ep3sw1"}

{"author":"eatpoetry","body":"Okay, I'm going to play the devil's advocate here, keeping in mind that I'm a pro-choice feminist who has taken a morning after pill before and has close friends who have had to have abortions.\n\nThey're just going to say that women \"ruined their own life\" by having sex. They don't understand that the reality is so much more nuanced, that many girls who have abortions are underage and that they and their partners were never taught about birth control, or they were raped, or they were using protection but it failed, or were in abusive relationships where they had their birth control tampered with.\n\nArguments like this don't work because they don't come at the opposition where they are: which is about controlling women at the root of it, yes, but in an unconscious way, and on the surface and more on the surface, this toxic idea that \"life begins at conception\" and allows them to paint women as murderers for what amounts to a logical fallacy (my religion says this, therefore it should be applied to everyone) and existential squeamishness. (the fuzzy borderline between living and non living things makes humans VERY uncomfortable).\n\nI could probably write an essay about this but you get the gist.

I suffer from extremely heavy periods. back pain so bad that I cannot sleep. heavy bleeding that's big clots to the point where the first 3 days of it I have to change my overnight pad at least every 2-3 hours. cramps that absolutely cripple me. not great to experience for 7-10 days each month, sometimes longer and sometimes even 2x a month when my career is as a welder\/ironworker in the field. on top of that there is a long history of cancer in my family. \n\nmy GP doctor recommended that I try naproxen to manage the cramps but it made me too tired at work. I'm a recovering addict so pain relief stronger than OTC Advil and Tylenol was out of the question. stretches did nothing. hot water bottle and A535 didn't work. he did get me on this pill Tranexamic acid to help reduce the blood clots which actually did help, but only if I started taking 3 a day juuust before spotting, which was impossible thanks to the unpredictable cycles. due to the cancer risk in my family he didn't really want me to take birth control unless i wanted to try that route, i trust my DR so i refused to take it. my last resort was surgery.\n\nI moved from Winnipeg to Vancouver in 2016 and had begun to give up. I tried 3 gynos here and 5 back home and it was essentially the same experience. first they ask if I have kids, when I say no they follow up with asking if I wanted kids in the future, again a hard no. back in my early 20s the conversation essentially stopped there because they would say \"this is not reversible and you may want kids in the future.\" age 32 update: still never want kids. another problem with these consultation appointments is they meet me for the first time that day. they don't know anything about me so the majority of the appointment is spent giving a super fast summary of my medical history and current medication. here in Canada with our free healthcare we always have to wait crazy amounts of time for an appointment with any specialist. in Winnipeg it was usually around 1 year, here in Vancouver its slightly better at around 8 months or so. because of this there is this weird pressure to rush through the appointments, I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. in the rush i forget certain things I intended to say to them that I planned to say over the months of waiting. anyway other questions are about my sexual orientation, one gyno even said \"well maybe you will meet a man and have kids with him\" after telling him I was gay. that meeting ended quickly. anyway I gave up.\n\nUNTIL my close friend got her partial hysterectomy. she told me about the gynecologist. one who was female, sensitive, patient, lgbt friendly, and with experience in treating survivors! I made an appointment with my GP to ask for a referral to this woman asap. he happily sent it out and 6 months later I had my consultation with her. she had a great energy. telling her my story after asking if the IUD was an option, I burst into tears telling her my moms horror story of when her IUD got stuck and needed to be surgically removed, leading to the stitches getting so infected it turned to necrosis which was very touch and go. I almost lost my mom. she completely understood my fears and didn't push. we had a really good consultation and she asked if I would be comfortable doing a pap smear and physical examination. as a SA Survivor I was initially unsure but she was super kind and supportive and talked me through the whole thing. at the end she gave me the rundown of the surgery and preparation information and such and we decided to try for January for the appointment. \n\nI got to say I was so extremely happy and content afterwards. I really look forward to the procedure. most importantly, I look forward to loving my womanhood again!  \n\n(in Canada you need referrals in order to have procedures and specialist consultations be covered by healthcare, going to a specialist on your own is at cost and the procedures and tests are also out of pocket, too much money for me)","created_utc":1689099779000,"comment_id":"jriohs2","parent_id":"t3_14wg5fp","score":38,"submission_id":"14wg5fp"}

While it may seem hollow, it's people using their voice, which is often all people have to give.\n\n\nDon't forget that modern society keeps us too busy, too poor, and too scared. Grown adults working as teachers are incapable of solving all their students problems because they don't personally have the resources.\n\n\nIf people put their full effort into righting every wrong they see, everyone would become happiness pumps and no one would get to live for themselves. \n\n\nThese guys did what they could. It's not empty to stand in front of students and your colleagues and the institution that employs you and in opposition to centuries of a social norm. That can risk your job, your reputation, and your place in your community.\n\n\nAlso, people learn almost exclusively through symbols. [C'est ne pas une pipe](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Treachery_of_Images?wprov=sfla1) and all that. We are completely enmeshed and engulfed in symbols. From the moment you wake up and think a word, to what's spoken in dreams. It's not nothing. It's the entire way we make sense of our world. \n\n\nTaking steps to show absurdity, and put yourself in front of the firing line to take that social heat off the student, inviting and challenging that it be redirected at willing adults, _is_ actually opening themselves up to the same repercussions. But how else would you show the absurdity, and try to take some of the heat while still caring for yourself and honoring all your current obligations? \n\n\nIn the past, they could have gotten fired, ostracized from their community, and sent to the looney bin, severely tortured and killed, burned at the stake, or I'm sure much else I don't want to think of. Just for this symbolic act of breaking a gender norm. Because it means something.\n\n\nAlls I'm saying is that showing solidarity is big. And I don't think you're giving it enough credit. \n\n\nBut if you truly feel that way, look up the kid and check in on him yourself instead of pointing out what _more_ you wish others would give.

{"author":"SuzanneBunkham84","body":"Trying to look at that comment from a non-feminist perspective it could be construed as a simple homage from a Cobain fan.\n\nFrom a feminist perspective it does indeed reinforce societal gender bias or probably more accurately it gives a snap-shot of the type of sexism that does not seem to be changing.\n\nI think it's interesting though because the world of art, encompassing music, literature etc has a perception of being more open to women than other roles within for example corporate or religious institutions. This is probably however, more in evidence in the realms of higher artistic pursuits which would by their nature place them further from the corporate world.\n\nI think it could also reflect the corporate mentality of the safety of selling what is known to have sold which delivers homogenous music, film and TV shows.\n\nThat realm of artistic endeavour is much closer to the male dominated industry's who distribute them for a mass market and could be argued to be much harder for females to get into and be paid the same as their male counterparts.\n\nThe film industry is a staggeringly sexist example of this as female directors and producers from the beginning of Hollywood right up to the present day are virtually non-existent with a very few exceptions.\n\n","created_utc":1525022320000,"comment_id":"dy5lpvd","parent_id":"t3_8fophv","score":-40,"submission_id":"8fophv"}

{"author":"moosepuggle","body":"Studies show that the vast majority of women just feel relieved after an abortion. \n\nResearch consistently shows that most women feel relief, not guilt, after having an abortion. A landmark study published in *Social Science & Medicine* followed nearly 1,000 women for five years and found that relief was the most common emotion reported at every time point. At the end of the study, 84% of participants expressed positive emotions or no emotions about their decision, while only 6% reported primarily negative feelings such as regret or guilt. Additionally, 99% of women affirmed that abortion was the right choice for them five years later[1][2][3].\n\nThe study also highlighted that initial feelings of sadness or guilt, often tied to decision difficulty or perceived stigma, declined significantly over time. Relief remained constant and was the dominant emotion throughout the study period[2][5]. These findings challenge claims that abortion leads to long-term emotional harm and suggest that negative emotions are more influenced by personal and social contexts rather than the procedure itself[5].\n\nSources\n[1] Abortion: The majority of women don\u2019t regret the procedure, study says https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/01\/12\/health\/women-abortion-emotion-study\/index.html\n[2] Study: Relief Most Common Emotion 5 Years Post-Abortion https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/obgyn\/pregnancy\/84345\n[3] Five Years After Abortion, Nearly All Women Say It Was the Right ... https:\/\/www.ucsf.edu\/news\/2020\/01\/416421\/five-years-after-abortion-nearly-all-women-say-it-was-right-decision-study\n[4] The Effects of Abortion Decision Rightness and Decision Type on ... https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC10257365\/\n[5] Emotions and decision rightness over five years following an abortion https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31941577\/\n[6] The facts about abortion and mental health https:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/2022\/09\/news-facts-abortion-mental-health\n[7] Years after abortion, women say they made the right decision https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/health\/2020\/01\/12\/five-years-after-an-abortion-most-women-say-they-made-right-decision\/\n[8] Post-Abortion Syndrome: Is It Real? - Healthline https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/post-abortion-syndrome","created_utc":1742799312000,"comment_id":"mje0g1x","parent_id":"t3_1jib2la","score":158,"submission_id":"1jib2la"}

{"author":"swap_98","body":"Just went throughout their sub and yes it's absolutely horrific and the fact that reddit allows this and the moderators allow comments and posts. I just a few comments outright mentioning their desire to rape women. \n\nThis is exactly why one needs to learn the consequences of what a war beings before starting war mongering. Women need to collectively take a stand because in any war that has ever happened in any place around the globe, women are the one with most to lose. We need to study more about how war affects women and I might continue on this path one day and research about it. I have read about wars in recent years and also if you take in context the partition, you realize how neatly pakistan and india covered up the mass genocide and rapes of thousands of women on both sides of the border. I never learnt about it before till high school and I am trying to study about it and as a feminist I think we definitely should always try to understand the deeper rationale, and factors of any event or incident before we join the ranks of the majority and their opinions. Any public opinion of the majority is often just an opinion of majority of men. And this is the reason why Men can control narratives and then let society be controlled by these manufactured narratives. Fantasizing about raping women on a subreddit might not seem harmful since it's less visible in the mainstream media and the men who engage in these subs are not a lot, but these fantasies further evolve into justifying rapes and then using political reasons to justify rapes such as war. And history has proved that once identity politics come into play, any crime whether it be genocide, or rapes, and other grotesque forms of sexual abuse are means used by a minority while the majority does its best to justify these crimes and let it happen. And these crimes often harm women rather than men disproportionately.","created_utc":1747059416000,"comment_id":"mrvej3z","parent_id":"t3_1kkdvdz","score":125,"submission_id":"1kkdvdz"}

{"author":"egginvader","body":"This type of delusion that exists in male dominated social circles, especially in gamer cultures, is directly leading to the abuse of women. I remember asking some of my friends what they think about when a woman likes games or these character in games etc, and they explained that a woman couldn\u2019t actually enjoy these games or be good at them. These are fellow men I, up until that moment, saw as incredibly progressive. \n\nI also noted that these men were more accepting of emotional abuse in relationships, and were only able to point out examples of manipulation when performed by a woman. They were less likely to call the actions of a man abusive, but were usually capable of recognizing when women were abusive. \n\nThey also did not believe that women were harassed online more frequently in regards to gender based harassment, sexual harassment, and other types of non-skill or game mechanics based bullying. This was even after presenting sources from the Anti Defamation League. I even found studies and surveys that focused on abuse of all types online and it showed a trend between male gamers who harass people online and a direct link to their likelihood of abusing women. They thought the solution was for women to \u201cbe less sensitive\u201d. Ironic, since they themselves were sensitive to scenarios when women abused men, but incapable of recognizing the opposite. \n\nI think what can benefit some men is spending time around women for non sexual or romantic reasons. My issue that I see is a lot of the guys who behave this way fall into one or two camps, incel misogynist who has never spoken to a woman or a misogynist who has lots of sex and only sees women as objects. This makes me really confused about how to change the way these men think.\n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s easier to change the minds of the misogynist who has sex with women and views them only for sex because they are at least capable of interacting with women. As long as those men are capable of recognizing consent and willing to hang around women they know they will be incapable of receiving sexual or romantic relationships with, they have made progress. (I have only seen this happen twice, out of the four or five times in my life where a man I knew who fell into this camp has interacted with a woman.) \n\nThe incel behavior of the other camp is only capable of being rooted out of these circles, in my experience, is when they meet a woman face to face. For some reason these incels continue to berate and act intolerably towards women online and in games, even when the women are respectful and are clearly not interested in them sexually or romantically. \n\n\nAs someone who in highschool considered himself a \u201canti-sjw\u201d because of the lack of critical thinking I had and exposure to toxic masculinity and thought online, I figured I would be able to walk these types of people out of the hole they are in. I\u2019m my situation, I realized that my behavior was a faze that existed because of the group dynamic associated with my friends I played games with. The dynamic fell apart when we introduced some girls we knew from school to it, who then played games with us and basically exposed us to feminism. We were never as bad as the incels I see online and in certain gaming circles, but I as a man have never been able to change another man\u2019s mind without the help of a woman or someone who leans to the identity spectrum of more fem than masc. This seems dangerous though because it exposes women or fem people to the type of people they are avoiding for protection. \n\nLiterally anything I try (alone and without the help of a woman or fem person) fails unless they are someone I get really close with, this is even after integrating myself into incel circles with the sole purpose of de-radicalizing them.  \n\nI understand this comment isn\u2019t the place to ask these questions but what started as a simple question about why men with more exposure to women still behave this way evolved into what I typed.
