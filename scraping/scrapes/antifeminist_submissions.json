I ended up just going no contact with her a few years ago because I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Two examples, and they're extreme but not the worst of what I put up with. She accused, yes ACCUSED, me of being a rape apologist because I am straight and only date men. I went on one date with a guy in our two year friendship. She dated 5-6 guys a week. And was banned from Tinder for harassing men. I could make a whole post about that too. And the second thing was she accused me of being a homophobe because I wouldn\u2019t make out with her. She would beg me. And it made me so uncomfortable. After I went no contact with her I couldn\u2019t with the feminism stuff. I thinks it\u2019s a cult at this point. I\u2019m sorry if that hurts anyone here. I just needed to vent. Something was terribly wrong with her not just because she was a feminist.

They are on the whole brainless. Furthermore they substitute their gross ignorance with beauty and good looks often by means of thousands of makeups and editing apps. They lack basic human feelings and emotions like empathy or even sympathy.They further gave feminism a whole new meaning. To them , it is not about equal rights but  getting more rights than the male population, rather stripping them off all possible rights. They expect more and contribute less. These women don't play fair. They are the ultimate source of dangerous office politics. Moreover there are also  incompetent men in India who often tend to support the hypocrises and injustices brought about by these so called toxic feminists in our society. The women here have all the possible traits of Dracula's brides or worse. You never know when you are gonna get bitten. They are inhuman, frigid , selfish etc.  Even an accidental touch constitutes rape or molestation and walking down the same road with them where a male just happens to coincidentally be walking behind the female constitutes stalking.

For he could not stand to see this beautiful woman lacking money or the basic needs of life he enjoyed so well. That woman - now wife and rich connived behind her rich husband's back to throw him out to the very same streets he rescued her from with his compassionate heart. She further sought to rob him of all of his wordly possessions through legal trickery and turn him out cold, hungry and with thirst because she could not stand to see him well-off, happy, and with food and drink. So it was with the tacit support of a corrupt family court system she stole that beautifully warm great house, his great wealth and sense of contentment.

It upsets me that so many people have been failed by an ideology meant to protect. When I say I am a feminist I mean giving women choice, choice to be a housewife and have lots of children or to be childless and become CEO of a motor company. It\u2019s about being awarded or denied something not bc of your gender but bc of your abilities. Yes this means hiring a man over a woman if he has more qualifications. Feminism isn\u2019t about eradicating femininity, at least it shouldn\u2019t be. Femininity is not just softness its so much strength. Motherhood is not brainwashing its such a unique experience with ups and downs, marriage, partnership also beautiful things. What needs to be addressed however, women still are treated as problems in things like healthcare; diagnosis and treatment. The truths is everything is set up according to the male biology; men have a 24h cycle a woman has a 28 day cycle. Father\u2019s feeling less guilty about being absent dad\u2019s to girls, Single mother\u2019s treated like tramps and single father\u2019s treated like God. The double standard is the issue. Boy\u2019s will be boys is the issue. Selling your daughter to the highest bidder is not part of culture, that label only enforces it. Look to the women, I see your rage you\u2019re confused bc now feminism is rebranded let\u2019s all be men but just better. Become the heartless Buisnesswoman, leave your husband and cheat on him and be American psycho but female version. As society we\u2019ve forgotten what this was all about. As to the men, you too are lost. Your fathers have been hated on for there actions but then this hate was just thrown on Yall when you were too young to grasp it and unaware of mistakes. I still stand my ground Andrew Tate was a mess, he gave Yall horrible advice and im like 90% convinced he was satirical. Caring for your loved ones is a strength, having feelings shows maturity and working hard is worth it. I\u2019m semi worried i will get obliterated in the comments, but if this made at least one person feel seen or understood it was worth it. \n\nThank you","title":"I am a feminist","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/antifeminist\/comments\/1lup9db\/i_am_a_feminist\/","upvote_ratio":0.45,"over_18":false}
