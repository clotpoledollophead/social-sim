I have to raise them not to suck in a world that constantly tells them that men suck. I 100% understand that most things in society that we detest have been carried out by guys. I don't deny that, nor do I shy away from speaking to my sons about these things. But the messaging to these young men is something that I worry about \n\nI thought of this after seeing that video with 6,000 replies on the TikTokCringe subreddit. The woman basically said men suck, and women don't need to date them because they are now wealthier and more educated. It's a subtle message I hear all the time from married women, as it's pretty chic for them to rip on their husbands (who are standing there) like they aren't there. Kinda awkward. \n\nMen are more likely to kill someone (usually other men), as well as more likely to kill themself. They are more likely to go to war, die in war. They are more likely to be drug addicts and homeless.

This is mainly about dating so if that's not of interest to you that's fine but just letting you know ahead of time. About me, I am 34-year-old male living in Chicago, 6'0\", fit, European and my dating history is pretty bad, with my relationships just turning to just using me. I would describe myself as average but I do put in a great deal into how I present myself. This is long so I provided a quick summary at the bottom.\r  \n\r  \nI have tried online dating, singles mixers and speed dating all of which amounted to nothing. I got no real matches, with the only ones interacting with me being scammers\/spammers or one response ghosters or women that just were verbally abusive. Singles mixers weren't any better, if I was lucky, I got to say my name before being told they weren't interested or I was outright ignored.  Speed dating was the worst since the interactions I got was pretty poor.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I spoke about this with other men their response was this was their experience as well. Singles mixers were effectively just like middle school dances with men on one side and women on the other and the few men that tried to approach got rejected.\r  \n\r  \nSo I tried to find a solution and I looked for it on Reddit through various dating subreddits, this was a mistake. My own mental health gotten worse with the responses I got, which either were suggestions to do things I have already done which caused a fight or that they had no idea but were certain I am at fault here.\r  \n\r  \nI also noticed a pattern, men who posted lamenting about their difficulties in finding women were often told that they need to make improvements to themselves, go to the gym, get better clothing, see a barber, etc and more often than not without any sort of additional details or photos of them or their profile. If a man made a generalization how they are no good women, they got skewered, their standards are too high, they aren't putting the effort needed, etc.\r  \n\r  \nWoman posting always got support, even if their post was generalizing such as there are no good men in NYC. There was no suggestions or critique at all. I would comment with questions to try and better understand a woman's perspective or view point as to answer my own dilemma and those were met with hostility. I was called names and some women who responded were oddly very defensive as well accusing me of wanting to change their standards when I just wanted to understand their standards. I never seen any assessment that they were doing something wrong even though there wasn't anything more concrete than that.\r  \n\r  \nAll in all my depression at this point was pretty bad. I have a problem that no one even has a hint as to what the root cause of it is nor any suggestions that I haven't already tried to resolve it.\r  \n\r  \nOne day I learned that certain opinions were considered to be highly problematic, akin to touching the third rail. This was in a post someone made advising users to go to offline events organized by dating apps such as Bumble. Users either thanked the poster for bringing these events to their attention and others posted their experience. A woman made a post was it wasn't a good event for her as she just ended up talking to other women as none of the men were \"below her league\" something that she also applied to all women not just herself, she called the men who did try and approach her and other women to be creeps for not \"reading the room\" and staying away from them. Me and two other men made 3 separate comments how these were essentially middle school dances with the women talking amongst each other, rejecting whatever man came up to them. I added into my comment that it seems like women nowadays are very picky and have set standards that are not just high but also unwilling to compromise on any.\r  \n\r  \nI was pretty quickly attacked for my comment, trying to defend myself I linked the earlier comment from the woman echoing the same experience just from the other side. This was then deleted by the mods for \"linking hateful material\" and so was my other comment referring with a warning not to bring it up. I never got a response from the mods how exactly is mentioning a live comment or referring to it was forbidden but the comment in the same post submission was permitted to stay up. After I made this question public that other comment was eventually taken down.\r  \n\r  \nI was told that the opinion that woman nowadays are very picky is problematic and wrong even though my opinion stems from my own experiences and sort of discussion about it was forbidden. It was maddening, imagine you having a problem, trying to self-reassess to no avail, asking others to provide their assessment but again to no avail and then expressing that perhaps the problem you face isn't something you can address yourself but is more dependent others to only be clapped back and told that it is in fact your fault.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I eventually done is go to my public library, hop on to EBSCO and other research sites and look up whatever if any professional research was made into this and found that it does appear that my experiences and opinions were valid.\r  \n\r  \n**Summary:** I have trouble dating, reached out for help but I was told I was at fault and doing things wrong even though no one knew what. I asked if perhaps women are just picky get told you are wrong, an idiot and at fault and dismissed only for my mental health to go down significantly as a result.\r  \n","title":"Men get told they suck, here is my experience.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18ns0ko\/men_get_told_they_suck_here_is_my_experience\/"}

I attribute this to the femification of men in today's society. Due to masculinity being attacked. I do think toxic masculinity is a thing and it should be fought against but I believe the fight against toxic masculinity has slowly became a fight against all masculinity. I feel as if this is why so many disinfranchised men are gravitating towards douche bags like Tate. He's a man who's condoned violence towards women and is an out and out liar when it comes to his life. He lied about being a chess champ, he lied about being a kickboxing world champ. He lied about how he made his money. He lied about how much money he has. He lied about abuse allegations, he lied about why he moved from the UK. His most recent lie is that he's a Muslim. Something he's only saying because he's cancelled in the west so he's trying to set up a fan base somewhere else.\n\n\nI think there's a middle ground when it comes to fighting toxic masculinity. We can teach men that it's okay to feel your emotions and even cry. We can teach men that it's okay to embrace traditionally feminine traits like being nurturing and emotive without teaching them that it's okay to wear make up or nail polish. We can fight against mysoginy but at the same time we can also let men know it's okay to be masculine and to embrace being the protector of the house and someone who's in good enough shape to offer some protection in the case of a worse case scenario. No one's saying dedicate yourself to martial arts but I believe a man should be in decent shape. There is a middle ground that should be reached. \n\nThe problem is the pseudo feminists and alt right are so vocal and close minded that they're isolating eachother into echo chambers. They should instead be meeting in the middle. I'm a feminist but not the modern type that cries over man spreading and women having the right to show their breasts in public. I believe in equality and believe there should be more done to tackle issues facing women such as gender based violence and discrimination as well as issues facing men such as stigma around mental health and toxic masculinity. \n\nDue to people on the far left being so quick to cancel people it's driving more and more men towards douchebags like Tate. The far left is inexplicably emboldening the far right. Imagine being a working class man and you finally get into college or uni and all you hear is that everything in the world is your fault and that you should be ashamed of being a man. Rather than trying to educate people are speaking to virtue signal and come off as being right.  \n\nWhile the far left are partly to blame for the isolation of men, men on the far right must realise that those social justice warriors aren't true liberals and that true liberalism isn't about shaming men but about equality and respect for all and that douchebags like Tate are fakes who exploit your feelings for personal gain. They aren't indicative of real men. Real men are kind but strong, real men protect those around them. Real men show their emotions and are a pillar of support for those around them. Real men can wear pink and they can even listen to harry styles and be feminists. What real men can't be are make up wearing, nail polish wearing guilt infused pathetic social justice warrior simps. \n\n\nAnyways my rants over... Ps I'm a liberal centrist 26 year old ex Muslim Asian living in the UK. I love philosophy especially stocisim and Buddhism. I'm not a alt righter nor am I a social justice warrior. I'm just a guy stuck in the middle expressing my thoughts so please don't come at me with attacks.","title":"Andrew Tate is a disingenuous narcissist.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18cjd7w\/andrew_tate_is_a_disingenuous_narcissist\/"}

I was born in a muslim country and continue to live in one.\n\nEver since I grew up, I have been hearing what is appropriate for women to wear in public and which parts of the body they can expose. I have seen great diversity in perspectives on modesty. \nThe amusing thing is, no matter where folks set their modesty bar, they always seem to think that whatever parts women choose to show must be for attention. It can be eyes, face, hair, hands, arms(some tolerate exposing half and oppose wearing sleeveless tops), neck, shoulders, midriff, back(depends on how much is exposed), legs(contingent upon length of skirt or short). The conception changes within families and cities. From one individual to the other. It is primarily set by family and then broader culture in addition to being heavily influenced by religiosity and social status. It even varies by events and places.\n\n\nLately, I've been coming across quite a bit of red-pilled and conservative content online regarding this issue. This content is exposed to a diverse audience, so I expected people to differ. However, contrary to my expectation, men from entirely different cultural backgrounds were endorsing the notion that women must dress according to their partner's preferences and show respect for them. What's insane is the fact that many of these men have their female relatives wearing clothes, which would be found immodest by the very same men consuming the same content.\n\n\nI have argued with a lot of them. It just seems that none of them are ready to comprehend the gravity of accepting that their understanding of modesty is subjective and culturally relevant, if they recognise that it is subjective and culturally relevant in the first place. Most of the time, I honestly feel like these morons are throwing punches in air or attacking some boogeyman named immodesty. \n\n\nWhy don't these men let women wear what they want. All women won't choose to dress similarly. They can then choose to marry a woman who they believe dresses per their expectation. Why don't these men work on their insecurity instead of demanding women to alter their apparel. Why don't they ask themselves why they hold certain beliefs and question their validity. \n\nModesty advocates are often trying to force their preferences on others. Be them be religious preachers or individual men. They are also actively shaming those who differ from them.\n\nWhen a man is comfortable with her wife's apparel, the disapproving men claim that he's not caring, loving, lacks self-respect, and acting like a cuckold. Some people have this peculiar belief that one should dress differently before marriage but should start dressing more modestly afterwards. \n\n\nThis is not to say that people can't dress \"modest\" or that I endorse literally going nude in public. But the variance in modesty norms is something I find quite perplexing.","title":"I find the concept of modesty absurd, and men trying to control what women wear obnoxious","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/186w1wu\/i_find_the_concept_of_modesty_absurd_and_men\/"}

So I'll get the most obvious thing out the way... Yes social media is messed up. Ofcourse it has its good sides but the sheer desperation of individuals trying to be famous online is insane. What's just as insane is the legitimacy that WE the everyday person grants these fame hungry fakers. Shallow influencers aside what about these horrible horrible tik tok challenges that literally has women objectifying their own bodies.  I feel like I can rant on about social media but most people here are probably clued on enough to know about it's shortcomings so I'll leave it be.\n\nAnother example of society and its moral bankruptcy is it's view of relationships. So no I'm not religious nor am I from a conservative country but man seeing how cheap relationships are made to be these days blows my mind. Now it's just a norm that you'll go on an app and join the proverbial meat market. It's also a given now that both guys and girls are entertaining multiple partners these days as they scramble to fill some sort of void or insecurity within themselves whilst distracting themselves with the attention they get from other people.  It's such a cheap way of meeting someone. Dating apps aside, what's with people keeping friends with exes? Why stay with someone who you either broke up with or who broke up with you. Why be friends with someone who literally let you down or you let down when it mattered most? \n\nAnother thing which I feel is a sign of society's moral decay is it's obsession with trends and celebs. Why are we so godamn obsessed with people we don't even know whilst we blindly follow whatever is trending. Are our lives that empty that we have to live vicariously through people we don't even know?! \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is how the world by in large doesn't actually care about a whole lot. Take the BLM movement, remember it trending and remember seeing so many of our friends suddenly become race relations experts? Well what I ask is, where are they now? They obviously don't care anymore because it's not trendy or popular to be speaking about it. Even though much of the issues BLM argued for still exist. Even the Ukraine conflict, remember all the stand with Ukraine posts Initially when it was trendy? Where are they now? Because Ukraine is still being attacked, do we suddenly not care anymore? Most of us never cared we only did it to show off... How disgusting.  It's the same reason why people by in large don't care about the Israel Palestine stuff unless they're either Jewish or Muslim or have some sort of vested interest or sadly hate towards eachother. There's tragedies happening all over the world which require very urgent attention but for some reason people by and large only care about what's trendy to care about. \n\n\nOur society is so godamn fake, not just on a superficial level but on a deeper level. We say we're open minded and value free speech yet cancel opinions we don't agree with and label them using some sort of buzz word to cancel debate. We claim to be understanding and we claim to value personality and intellect over looks yet ask any average or below average guy or girl how much success they have on tinder.  We say we value indvidiualsim and how we should all be ourselves yet base life of off what we see others doing. In this in age almost every view is just a regurgitated talking point rather than a view we actually did research on and came to based on our thoughts and experiences.\n\n\nWe are a fake society who's seemingly only obsessed with looking the part rather than being the part. No one seems to actually care about eachother but so long as they can look like they care then they're happy. No one seems to actually value indvidiualsim because everything they do is based of off what they see online, what their friends are doing or what their so called clique should typically be doing. It's a dog eat dog world? Nah it's a dog pretend to be cat world. No one seems to actually believe in what they stand for. \n\nThe world is cheap and morally bankrupt.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT- To everyone calling me old or saying i don't go outside or that I'm hateful or even racist.... As I've stated on this posts comments. I'm 26 university educated and Asian  living in the UK.  It's very rich those attacking this post by attacking me are accusing me of being on the internet but you are the ones acting like entitled and rude individuals by hurling personal attacks something which people usually only do online. It's you that needs to go out and spend less time on the internet so you can perhaps learn some manners. \n\nI posted this as a discussion point. I didn't post to attack anyone, if I'm wrong then politely state your case and let's have a rational discussion because it I'm wrong then I'd love to be corrected. I'm not here to be right and force people to agree with me, I'm here to learn and have a discussion with individuals all over the world. The internet has bad and good uses, I thought I'd try to make a good use of it because my friends say I often get carried away with politics, social issues and religion so I've made this account to just rant about stuff and see different perspectives to mines.

But I always equate OF to twitch streaming, for every super famous multi-millionaire there are 10s of thousands of people whose only viewers are their friends and families. For every super sexy 20 something making 300k a month there are thousands of young women who made an OF out of financial desperation or in search of a short cut to pay their bills.\n\nMany young women are drawn to the marketing popularity in the same way that young men are drawn to Twitch's marketing. It's a seemingly easy way to make a lot of money doing something you already do on your spare time. But just like twitch, most people see minimal if any success before moving on to a regular job and hoping the subject doesn't come up. The only difference is that twitch streamers may be embarrassed of cringe video content while OF girls have their most intimate interactions and body parts plastered for any creepy family member or snooping coworker to find reverse image search. It does serious harm to young women who may have had a lapse of judgement in a moment of desperation.\n\nOnlyFans knows this, they have a target demographic for both models and consumers. They want to attract a plethora of young women to the platform. They want the average woman to publish content that pulls the coworker, acquittance, or classmate to the platform. People who want to see that woman naked but don't have a chance at them in real life.\n\nAs for its consumer base, my opinion remains the same as any porn in the US. Its target demographic is mostly young men ages 12-28 who have no self control of their consumption rate. There's a reason its so easy to access these websites but that's another discussion entirely.\n\nFinally, its harmful to society as a whole because it took the rather small scale harm porn had on women who produced it and marketed it to every young woman who had a phone. It normalized the production of pornographic content. Where porn previously targeted nearly all men and women indirectly, it now reached out to every woman of voting age.\n\nI know this is going to be a very unpopular opinion on Reddit specifically and the common argument is \"Well that's a society problem\" but the harm it does to these women is severe and can't be understated. You can't change that by screaming about how employers and men need to be accepting and women shouldn't feel ashamed. But you can change it by acknowledging that OF directly markets to desperate young women and destroys many lives and relationships to make its financial goals. It's digital prostitution.","title":"OnlyFans is a predatory business which is objectively harmful to society","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1arlt1x\/onlyfans_is_a_predatory_business_which_is\/"}

When this doesn't work and they fall pregnant, they head right down to the nearest women's clinic and get an abortion.\n\nHere's the problem. If the 6 week ban goes into effect, they will not be able to do that. They most likely will not afford to be able to travel to a state that kept abortion legal. So what happens when they give birth to all those unwanted kids? They will abuse and neglect them, the kids will go into an already overworked foster care system where they will likely age out, be angry at the world, start committing crimes and finally, wind up incarcerated. Even if they don't abuse and\/or neglect them, they will likely have to go on government assistance which unfortunately makes them a target for DCF (Because that agency knows they won't be able to hire a good lawyer to fight against false abuse\/neglect allegations) leading to... kids being put into foster care, then the cycle repeats.\n\nSo I hope that Desantis has a plan in place to hire more cops and expand the jails in 14-21 years because he wanted to \"save the babies.\"\n\nSource: I live here.\n\nPS: Texas is going to have the same issue.

In particular, it's interesting to me how people have these 'concerns' about where trans people go to pee.\n\nI am trans. I find these conversations entertaining because of how strong the opinions of anti-trans people are, yet on the other hand, this is an 'issue' which their opinion has no real bearing on anything at all regardless of how they feel about it. It's a guilty pleasure of mine to get stoned, read these anti-trans dipshit's comments, and laugh at how stupid they are.\n\n> **\"bathrooms are and have always been single sex spaces\"**\n\nIt's weird people assume these things. Trans people have been using the bathroom of their gender for decades. That hasn't really changed since the recent panic fabricated as a wedge issue by the Republican party. The way things are is the way things have been. Conveniently I think this rephrasing of the past is either based on ignorance or to frame trans people as some kind of invaders in spaces they've always been in.\n\n> **\"well, if we let trans people into the bathroom of their gender, they might assault someone\"**\n\nWe should also get rid of guns since people might shoot someone. We should operate on presumption of guilt for people and assume guilty until innocent. If we do this, maybe we can start by assuming all cis men are guilty of assault until proven innocent since that demographic seems to assault women the most... any issues with this?\n\nAssault is illegal.\n\n> **\"this allows people to pretend they are trans and go into the bathroom and assault someone\"**\n\nIf someone is going to rape or assault someone, a sign on the door won't change that. We don't have to strip someone's access to public facilities due to concerns about some unrelated bad actor possibly performing acts of evil. If someone wants to pretend to be trans and go assault a bunch of people, that's not great... but what the fuck does that have to do with people like me though. I'm just tryina pee.\n\n> **\"but what if there's a penis\"**\n\nThis one always makes me laugh because of how juvenile the concern is. Yeah... what if there *was* a penis? Is this covid related? And if so, *what do we do about it?*\n\nI donno about you people, but I've never seen a penis in the bathroom. Even in the men's room, when men use the urinal, seeing someone's junk means someone is doing something wrong. Indecent exposure last I checked is already a crime. A dick isn't required (except the person being one); a cis woman can go out in public and riff off her vag like she's playing a guitar and people are gonna have a problem with it (I would fucking hope). When you act unhinged and like a psycho, I don't think genitals or having a penis has much to do with it. Can we stop worrying about what's in someone's pants? You don't need to know what's in mine. I don't want to know what's in yours. You could be hiding a subway sandwich in there for later and I don't need to know about it because you'll be using a bathroom stall.\n\n> **\"why cant they just use the men's room. they make me uncomfortable\"**\n\nYes, I agree. As a trans woman, cis women make me uncomfortable and I think they should just use the men's room. Society does not need to cater towards the comfort of cis women. There isn't any safety concern with men using the men's room, so why can't cis women also use the men's room? If people don't want cis women using the men's room, why should I use the men's room? I know who and what I am. I don't need other people's help taking a shit.\n\nWe could go over these stupid talking points all day but at the end of the day, the funny thing is, these are talking points.\n\n**This leads to my final point**, that these anti trans bathroom talking points are incredibly stupid, but *they also don't fucking matter*. People can carry their opinions about where people like myself pee to the grave. Their opinions are irrelevant. We can have a 3 hour discussion about the nuance about where people like myself choose to take a shit and I'll continue to not give one, but at the end of the day, these discussions won't change a damn thing. At best, an anti trans reactionary becomes marginally more afraid to go out in public (a good thing lmao), and at worst, collectively, society decides to implement more unenforceable laws that primarily affect and hurt gender nonconforming (and often cis, butch) women.\n\nI look like a woman, am a woman. I've used the women's restroom. I've never had a problem.\n\nPeople can have these discussions about where people should pee all day but I already know which bathroom to use. Please, spend hours debating over what bathroom you think trans people should use. It's entertaining to me, and at the end of the day, it won't change a damn thing.\n\nOr maybe we can find a better discussion topic.\n\nPS: Can't wait for the next \/u\/lilqueerkid post here.

( https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/321143\/americans-stand-abortion.aspx ) Abortion was a fantastic issue for the right for decades, because it was always low-hanging fruit to get voters to the polls. When the Republican party married itself to Evangelical Christianity in the late 70s and early 80s, they made restricting abortion a political, moral, and spiritual cornerstone of their party. Save babies - vote Republican!\n\nBut ever since Roe was repealed, it's been a double-whammy against the GOP. First, now their voters aren't as motivated to vote. Why would they be? The one issue that single-issue voters cared about has now been \"solved.\" And since the Supreme Court made it so that it's up to states to decide what restrictions should be on abortion access, once a red state enacts a huge restriction or ban on abortion, there's no risk of it being overturned unless a Constitutional amendment passes - which won't happen at a federal level.\n\nThe shoe is now on the other foot - now voters who DO care about abortion are especially motivated to vote. And why would they vote for the GOP politicians who overturned their right to an abortion in the first place? Since Roe was repealed, the GOP has seen massive backlashes in several states that once leaned red or were deep purple. ( https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/us\/how-abortion-could-impact-2024-us-elections-2023-12-14\/ ) The 2022 election, which had been expected to deliver a large amount of seats to Republicans, fell flat for them instead. Conservative states like Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky have had election results turn in favor of pro-reproductive right initiatives (and thus Democrats over Republicans). And horror stories about the \"unintended\" consequences of banning abortion - which were screamed from the rooftops by liberals and widely ignored or mocked as being unrealistic by conservatives - are constantly popping up in the news, keeping the issue fresh in the minds of voters. People are horrified when reading about women forced to keep miscarried fetuses, or birth children who die within days in horrible pain, or forcing underage rape victims to give birth. Doctors - especially those involved in OB-GYN capacities, are fleeing from the states with the worst restrictions, impacting everyone seeking healthcare.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/news\/roe-gop-abortion-restrictions\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/09\/06\/us\/politics\/abortion-obstetricians-maternity-care.html\n\nArizona in particular is a good example because the state is very narrowly blue and Trump lost there last election. It was expected to be a key battleground state for the 2024 election, but with the AZ Supreme Court ruling, AZ voters are extremely riled up. Riled up people tend to turn out to vote, making the GOP campaigns both locally and nationally much more difficult.\n\nSo yes, any republican you hear saying that there is going to be a \u201cred wave\u201d or some such nonsense this November is coping on levels never seen before.

But at the same time, we make distinctions in language for a very practical reason: distinctions exist!\n\nSo if people say there are no differences between biological women and trans women, how do they not realize they, themselves, are saying there is something less about being trans? Or something wrong with it?\n\nIt's not wrong and it's not less. It's just different to be trans. And that's not an opinion. It's a fact.\n\nIf we keep rejecting facts, how do we think we're ever going to grow as a society?","title":"Why do people get so upset about the concept of biological vs. trans men and women?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/189y8t6\/why_do_people_get_so_upset_about_the_concept_of\/"}

They enjoy their partner bc of what they can DO FOR THEM or how they make them appear to the rest of the world.

As long is doesn\u2019t impede on his time or impair his life, they are indifferent. They often prefer her to just suffer in silence than to address any issues with their own behavior or actions. They will also turn her expression of a need or want around on her and call her a b*tch or a nag.\n\nTHIS is likely why 70% of divorces are initiated by a woman.

Why is it disrespectful to call someone a nickname they don't want to be called, but not disrespectful to call someone a name they don't want to be called? Why is it harmful for a child to see a man in woman's clothing but not to see a man in an easter buddy costume or in the lion king on broadway? If a transgender person walks into the men's room and no one knows he was assigned female at birth, does he make a sound?\n\nThese people who cannot ask themselves \"why, really\" do not know the difference between justified and arbitrary.

If all that has taught me anything, it\u2019s that human beings are reliably terrible at innately comprehending and gauging risk. We are at the same time prone to grossly overestimate the actual risk of certain threats, while vastly underestimating other threats. Take vocal opposition to nuclear energy, for instance. A lot of people are terrified of the prospect of being near or downwind of a nuclear meltdown. Fair enough, however, in the 70 years since the first full scale civilian nuclear power plant went active, nuclear energy has proven to be far and away the safest source of electricity we have, with fewer attributable deaths per megawatt hour produced than any other electricity source, including wind and power. The problem is, people mistake \u201chazard\u201d for \u201crisk.\u201d What would happen to you if you were exposed to radiation from a nuclear meltdown is the hazard, but risk is more than just hazard. Risk is the intersection of hazard and exposure; it factors in the severity of the hazard something presents along with the likelihood of being exposed to that hazard.\n\nThe \u201dman or bear\u201d so-called \u201cthought experiment\u201d attempts to exploit humans\u2019 misunderstanding of hazard vs risk, especially a common overestimation of the risk of wild animal attacks, but gets hazard\/risk wrong in every way possible. This isn\u2019t just a matter of semantics, or an academic nitpick; the confusion the \u201cthought experiment\u201d creates is actually counterproductive to the important end goal of women being able to be safer in society.\n\nThe conclusion behind this viral meme is that most women would feel safer encountering a bear in the woods than a man because of the low number of bear attacks and the high number of cases of violence against women. This is the first major mistake this meme makes, and it\u2019s all about exposure. The reason there are so few bear attacks is because there are only about \\~300,000 bears in all of North America to begin with, and those bears a dispersed throughout rural and wilderness areas where human population is low, while the vast majority of people spend most or all of their time in urbanized areas where there are no bears to be exposed to. Conversely, there are \\~165 million men in the US alone, and a woman is likely to cross paths with multiple men every day, that\u2019s a level of exposure many orders of magnitude higher than exposure to a bear, so of course risk is going to be higher across a population even in hazard is much lower, that\u2019s just how the math works.\n\nBut once a woman is out in the woods, and actually encounters a bear, or a man, \u00a0the relative exposure factor of the risk equation is out the window, you\u2019re already exposed, and now it\u2019s all about raw hazard. And this is where the meme makes its second major, and arguably more serious blunder \u2013 its misunderstanding of hazard. The hazard bears (or any other large animal you might encounter in the wild) present to humans they encounter is pretty evenly distributed across all bears. Sure, a mother bear, or a bear that has been habituated to human presence may present a somewhat elevated hazard, but by and large, any individual bear you come across has a relatively high hazard quotient by virtue of being several times larger and stronger than us, with big sharp pointy teeth and claws, and being wild animals and thus their behavior not being very predictable (even those not on cocaine) by the average hiker. The average individual human male, on the other hand, has a much lower hazard quotient \u2013 not only are we much closer to human females in size and lacking in teeth and claws, but we also have culture, social mores, and laws that the vast majority of human males abide by, and on top of that, because men and women are of the same species women innately understand human behavior better than they do bear behavior and can better judge whether a man might be a high hazard man or not. That\u2019s the key thing, while bears are high hazard animals across the board, and present that hazard equally to any human who encounters them, hazard is not evenly distributed in men at all, nor is vulnerability to high-hazard men evenly distributed among all women. Unprovoked assault of strangers is heavily concentrated among men from low socioeconomic groups, vulnerability to violence, especially sexual violence, is heavily concentrated among women, and \u2013 here is the big one \u2013 a woman is FAR more likely to be victimized by a man she knows than by a stranger.\n\nThe fact that a woman is far more likely to be sexually victimized by someone she knows, far more likely to be assaulted or killed by an intimate partner than a stranger, is particularly damning of the \u201cbear or man\u201d so-called \u201cthought experiment.\u201d I was a little kid in the early 1980s when cases like the murder of Adam Walsh (son of John Walsh of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d) helped ignite the \u201cStranger Danger\u201d moral panic. \u00a0Cases of children being kidnapped by strangers were and still are extremely rare, but that didn\u2019t stop parents from focusing on that hazard, while the country neglected the fact that most child sexual abuse and kidnapping is committed by a member of the family or a close friend of the family, just as the \u201cman or bear\u201d meme perpetuates an idea about men being potential rapists of any women they come across, while neglecting to focus on the real problems of acquaintance rape and intimate partner abuse\/murder. That\u2019s the problem with simplistic, sensationalistic, and poorly conceived talking points like the \u201cman or bear\u201d meme.\n\nIdeas like these aren\u2019t just unhelpful, they are harmful and counterproductive. The focus on \u201cstranger danger\u201d didn\u2019t just set back awareness of family\/friend\/teacher sexual abuse, it led to more punitive criminal justice and mass incarceration across the board for all infractions, not just sexual crimes. It also fundamentally changed the way parents raised their children, more fearfully, more supervision, less independence, more structure. And those children now are raising children \u2013 many of whom are already college age or older, a generation that reports through the roof levels of anxiety and depression. We are just coming up on four years since the beginning of the MeToo movement, we need to be mindful of the potential long term consequences of focusing on the wrong things, the wrong men in some cases. Some might argue that this viral meme is about \u201cawareness\u201d and would lead men to reconsider their beliefs, but all spreading memes like this accomplishes is se;f-congratulatory preaching to the choir. Men who rape or assault women have something broken in them; hearing other men make mildly misogynistic jokes didn\u2019t make them rapists any more than playing violent video games \u201ccreates\u201d mass shooters, and hearing some guy respond \u201cthat\u2019s not cool, bro\u201d to a misogynistic comment isn\u2019t going to fix what\u2019s wrong with them. And contrary to the pastiches of male culture some people have constructed in their heads, normal, decent guys don\u2019t sit around in groups letting misogynistic comments pass. I wouldn\u2019t stick around a group of guys where that was norm long enough to try to \u201cchange\u201d the men there, I just pick better friend groups than that. And any guy who is in a friend group that is bad enough that happens, if it\u2019s that pervasive, that friend group is already toxic, \u00a0all him calling it out will do it make him a target. The only men who both need to be convinced and also are capable of being convinced are men who aren\u2019t necessarily misogynistic, but don\u2019t give a lot of thought to the issue, and frankly, this hamfisted simplistic meme that paints all men with a broad brush is just going to turn those guys off. You can say \u201cthey should look past that and understand the intent\u201d or something like that, and maybe in an ideal world they should do that, but if they aren\u2019t doing that, you need to change your tactics. Do you want to be \u201cright\u201d, or do you want to successfully persuade people?","title":"A Risk Expert on why the \u201cMan or Bear\u201d \u201cthought experiment\u201d is worse than unhelpful","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1cjgxqn\/a_risk_expert_on_why_the_man_or_bear_thought\/"}

I thought maybe - being rather \"old\" - I was way out of touch.  But no - every article I looked up regarding that very early on referred to the \"sexiness\" of the suit.  Just what I thought - more so than a regular two piece (even one that exposes a lot of hip, breast, and below the navel but above the pubic area.  In my (maybe ignorant) view - it's the subliminal suggestion of the string (tied in a bow that can easily be undone) that creates the extra \"sexiness\".\n\nOne article had a comment from a mom \"I tell my daughter to double knot it so it can't be untied easily.  Whoah - obviously anyone who would do that ought to be arrested - but still, it acknowledges the subliminal suggestion.\n\nNow I won't say that many young girls make that choice but it IS available to them.  But that's only the most vivid case.  There are also \"cheeky\" suits (the actual term), and others that on a girl much older would definitely be considered \"sexy\".\n\nOK - what's the dilemma?  Telling her \"no\" to a two piece is body shaming IMO.  But at her age, she simply doesn't know what \"sexy\" even is.  So how do you steer her away from the \"sexy\" ones?  I told my son they probably need to be prepared to have a talk about sexuality etc much earlier than they expected.  Preventing her from wearing what she wants \"just because\" is worse than giving in (imo).\n\nBut those can't be the only two choices.\n\nIt's a shame (no pun intended) that we talk about \"body positivity\" so much.  I FULLY agree no one should feel NEGATIVE about their body.  But why is one or the other?  Why not \"body neutrality?  It seems so many girls\/women are PROUD of their bodies to the extent of revealing a lot of it in dress commonly considered \"sexy\".  I don't' think that's healthy either.  It's their right - obviously.  But really, what is there to be proud of?  (I'm not talking about healthy or athletic bodies of course - only those that display themselves in a way commonly considered \"sexy\" by both men AND women.)\n\nIf - for example - a woman displays a lot of their breasts and they are above average - might that send a message to OTHER women that \"bigger really IS better\"?  I read comments saying \"sexiness\" makes them feel confident and empowered.  Confident and empowered to do what?  Succeed in their career?    \n\nWill my grandgirls all need to feel proud of their bodies (and sexuality) to do well in life?  Of course not.  NOT feel bad - yes.  Not feel guilty about sexuality - yes.  \n\nFlaunt it?  I would think not, and yet, to hear some women talk, it IS an advantage to them.\n\nWhy do women do that to themselves?  Or am I really out of touch.\n\nPlease - I'm NOT a prude or religious zealot.  And I'm not trying to be critical.
