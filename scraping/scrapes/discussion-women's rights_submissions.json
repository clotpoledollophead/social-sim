One great jobs report after another. The stock market hitting new highs week after week after week. Scientists respected. Women's rights protected. Civil rights legislation enforced. No one was above the law. Nobody was afraid to fly on airlines. Nobody worried about being targeted by the federal government and being fired. We had a government that looked like the people. We had a president who consoled Americans when they grieved. People were proud to call themselves Americans.\n\nWhile Republicans screamed that President Biden used Executive Orders too often, in fact, Biden got more bi-partisan legislation passed than any president since LBJ. Republicans screamed that unknown people were really in charge - now we know exactly who is giving the orders and it's not the POTUS. Elon Musk is in charge and this administration is filled with billionaires. The constitution is being trampled on.\n\nI warned people on this subreddit for the last four years that \"these are the good old days.\" Now they are gone forever. Remember the shining city on the hill? The lights are out and nobody's home.","title":"Remember The Good Old Days When Joe Biden Was President?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1ignlrm\/remember_the_good_old_days_when_joe_biden_was\/","upvote_ratio":0.78,"over_18":false}
