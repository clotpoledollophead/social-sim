In December when I wrote my original post I was at my wits end.  My life was falling apart and I was having suicidal thoughts. At that time I had no one to talk to and felt completely alone. The outpouring of support lifted a massive weight from me. Many of you messaged me directly to express your concern, offer help, or share your similar stories. I honestly believe posting here on r\/mensrights may have saved my life. One user, in particular, was a massive help. He contacted me via DM and told me he had gone through something similar quite recently. He was kind enough to tell me his real name, and a simple google search brought his sexual assault case up immediately. He gave me his number and spoke with me on the phone for several hours, which eventually lead to me hiring the same attorney.  The attorney\u2019s name is Antoinette O\u2019neill, and if any of you find yourself, or someone you know in the situation I was in, I can\u2019t recommend her enough. [https:\/\/parlatorelawgroup.com\/content\/antoinette-quinn-oneill](https:\/\/parlatorelawgroup.com\/content\/antoinette-quinn-oneill).  \n\nThe amount of sexism and discrimination I felt through this whole process can\u2019t be properly related in a reddit post. The US Military has essentially given women a get out of jail free card when it comes to sexual assault allegations, however absurd those accusations may be. My accuser has been protected at all costs. The \u201cinvestigators\u201d tore apart my life. They interviewed co-workers, acquaintances, ex-girlfriends, friends, etc. Anyone who they felt would help them prove my guilt, they spoke to. When I was originally informed of the accusation, I was told it was the investigators job to find the truth, to collect facts, and allow JAG to take things from there. When I received the Results of Investigation Report, or ROI, what stuck out immediately is investigators never once interviewed any of the \u201cvictims\u201d friends, family, co workers, ex-boyfriends, etc. They never attempted to ascertain the validity of her claims. She told a minimum of a dozen people about the assault, including her chain of command, and not a single one of them was interviewed. They simply came at me from every conceivable angle. They interviewed people I had not seen or spoken to in YEARS. The sad truth is, if they had investigated her absurd claims, they would have discovered the truth in a short amount of time. Instead, the process took a full YEAR to complete because they never once attempted to confirm a single aspect of her story. As an example, she claimed that she could not accurately place where the sexual assault occurred. She simultaneously claimed to have used a ride share app to leave my residence and travel home. Those two statements together make zero sense. Yet they never once asked her to show the ride share app receipt, history, or contact the ride share app company for documentation of the travel. HOW IN THE FUCK DID THEY NOT ASK THAT SIMPLE OF A QUESTION!? That should have been extremely easy to produce if the statement was true. If they had, her entire story would have begun to fall apart. It was absolutely infuriating.   They interviewed anyone they could find I had contact with to see if I had \"confided\" in them about \"what I did\".  Their exact words when interviewing one of my friends.  Meanwhile, they didn't interview a single one of her friends to see if she had confided in them about the assault or any of the lies she told.  How the fuck is that not discriminatory?\n\nAfter a full year of no word and my administrative hold, I was informed that JAG felt they had enough probable cause to charge me with the sexual assault, among other more minor crimes associated with the assault, and we moved onto the Article 32 hearing. This is where my attorney embarrassed the prosecution and easily ripped their remarkably weak case apart. For those unfamiliar, the Article 32 is sort of a pre trial for military members, which a 3rd party official oversees the charges and decides on their validity before proceeding to court martial. Since I refused to speak with law enforcement without an attorney, it was my first opportunity to refute the charges, show any evidence I have in my defense if I so chose too. The officiating officers\u2019 job is to analyze both sides and decide what charges should be taken to court martial.   Due to COVID very few people were physically present in the room. It was mainly done through video teleconference. The prosecution attempted to explain and justify their bullshit charges, which included a lot of \u201cummm \u2026 \u201cand rifling through paperwork to answer questions from the officiate. It was obvious they were ill prepared and inexperienced. When it came time for Toni to speak, she ripped their case apart in a matter of minutes without once looking at notes, needing to look up or reference precedent etc. She flat out embarrassed them, and in that moment, I knew she was worth every single penny I had to pay for her representation. Afterwards, I realized how I must have looked on camera while Toni was ripping them apart, cause I was staring at her in awe of her abilities. I was being charged with a life ending crime and I had a giant shit eating grin on my face watching my attorney work. It\u2019s one thing to be told someone is good at their job, but seeing it happen in real time was impressive to say the least. A couple weeks after the Article 32 ended we received the report from the officiate. My favorite line was, which was written by a female officiate in a sexual assault case, \u201cThis case, borderline, meets the low legal standard for probable cause, but likely would not if there was the ability to cross examine the victim and witnesses\u201d. It was explained to me the only thing necessary for a sexual assault allegation to meet probable cause is a reputable accuser. That is it. If the court believes the girl that made an accusation is of sound mind and body, and the accusation sounds possible, they have probable cause to bring charges to court martial. For my case, they said it met the low legal standard, barely, but would not if my attorney had been able to cross examine the victim or witnesses during the article 32. AKA a good attorney would have easily been able to rip her story apart if given the opportunity to question her about her absurd claims.  Later on in the report, she literally expressed (in big legal terms) that she didn\u2019t believe the victims accusations, that multiple aspects of her story were contradictory, and most importantly, she directly benefited from the accusation which caste significant doubt on the validity of her statements. Furthermore, JAG and investigators never even proved that they had jurisdiction to investigate the claim or prosecute me. How\u2019s that for some shit. A year of hell and nobody even checked to see if they were in their legal right to do anything. Some real high IQ\u2019s in the legal office. After the report was published, it went up the chain. Nearly two months later I got a phone call from my attorney letting me know all charges were being dropped. No explanation on why they were, but it is not difficult to figure out. After more than a year of hell, I get a nice fancy letter signed by a general and get told to move on with my life. \n\nUnfortunately, in the time since then I know it is not over for me. I find that my fear and anxiety over being helpless and discriminated against has slowly turned to pure anger of the injustice of it all. She has suffered zero consequences, and more than likely won\u2019t. The common line I\u2019m getting from people who were informed of the situation is, \u201cjust move on.\u201d But I can\u2019t.  I used to lie awake at night in fear of going to prison for something I didn't do.  Having everything I've worked for my entire life gone at the word of a bitch trying to save herself.  Now, I lie awake at night knowing she got everything she wanted.  She and I still wear the same uniform.  She gets to walk around knowing she won. \n\nI\u2019m considering filing a defamation of character or libel civil suit against my accuser. Her actions cost me a great deal of money, damaged my career, and to say my mental health and personal relationships have suffered is an understatement. On top of all that, the military has no way of expunging charges. For the rest of my life, when an employer runs my background check, they will see a sexual assault arrest and charge on my record. That is never going to go away.  Part of me is disappointed this didn\u2019t go to court martial, and so was my attorney. We had so much evidence of my innocence, which is rare in sexual assault accusations, that she was looking forward to calling her out on all her lies on the witness stand. The charges may have been dropped, but since they were dropped without prejudice, the door remains open. It wasn\u2019t an admittance that I am innocent, it was an admittance that they knew they weren\u2019t going to get a conviction with the bullshit case they had presented. Proving she lied in court would have made me feel exonerated, instead, I just feel angry.  \n\nIf anyone has any legal resources, or a civil attorney I can have a consult with I \u2018d appreciate any suggestions. My accuser and I are both military, and we are now in different states then when this all began. I don\u2019t\u2019 even know what state I\u2019m supposed to file the law suit in. The state the accusation was made, the state I reside, or the state she resides? I don\u2019t want to let the cat out of the bag just yet, but I will say I can prove she lied, and actually committed a felony while doing so. She made sworn statements in court, in front of a judge, which were complete fabrications, and I can prove it. We had all this prepared for the court martial to confront her in person. I\u2019m hoping this leverage will aid the resolution of a civil suit, because if the military found out they would prosecute her, she would be discharged and possibly face jail time. I want justice, and you are all more than welcome to come along for the ride.  Again, Thank you all so much. You helped save me, and I am grateful.","title":"UPDATE: I've Been Falsely Accused of Sexual Assault , My Life Has Become A Living Hell and Nobody Cares","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/i9wxaa\/update_ive_been_falsely_accused_of_sexual_assault\/"}

He's my #1 sidekick and our bond is obvious to all but the densest of minds. \n\nSaturday afternoon (7\/31) he and I went to an outlet mall nearby because I needed some new jeans, and he's in need of some new clothes, himself.  \n\nWe stopped after about an hour to have a hot dog and then decided that some ice cream sounded good.  We made our way to an ice cream kiosk\/booth - bags in hand - and bought 2 cups of ice cream, then found a bench to sit down. \n\nNow, to set the scene, my grandson insists on copying everything I do, right down to the way I dress. If I'm wearing boots, he too must wear boots. Same goes with ball cap, t shirt, etc.  \n\nOn this day, we were both wearing college apparel from my Alma mater.  Hat and t-shirts were almost identical.  Jeans and converse chucks as well.  He was my mini-me. \n\nAs we're eating our ice cream and he's pointing at different objects, people, etc., I hear someone say \"Sir, do you have any ID?\"  I turn to look and its a male and female officer.  No \"how we doing?\" or anything.  Just ID.\n\nLong story short,  someone had called them because its suspicious for a 49 year old man to have such a young toddler with him, and I was suspected of possibly abducting him.  \n\nNevermind him screaming as soon as they picked him up and began turning him where he couldn't see me. Forget that we were eating ice cream together, dressed alike and he kept pointing and saying \"Pop. NO!\" while they put me in in cuffs for my own protection.  (I guess I shouldn't have been questioning them.)\n\nI complied with every request. I explained at least 10 times, who I was and why I had him - the whole history leading from his birth til now,  to what ended up being 6 different officers; all the while listening to my boy cry hysterically. \n\nIn the end, a sergeant decided that I was okay, and let us leave, but I'm afraid this scare is going to stick with the boy for awhile.   It was a nightmare, trying to drop him at daycare this morning.  \n\nI never had to deal with this with my two (no grown) children.  How does one go about getting some kind of official ID that matches a child to a specific adult?  I don't want to experience this again, just because I'm a man. \n\nAnyone else had to deal with this?","title":"Detained by police for \"Man with child\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/owkpe0\/detained_by_police_for_man_with_child\/"}

This is pure, unbridled, and unapologetic misandry from these subreddits. I'm going to name names.\n\n**TwoXChromosomes**\n\nMost recent post about Amber Heard was a year ago--well past the time when we knew her story wasn't holding up--about her reading a letter about abuse allegations at the Incredible Women (barf) Gala. There are previous posts made three years ago about her initial allegations against Depp.\n\nZero talk about how she was the abuser. Every post with exculpatory evidence for Depp is deleted either by automod or manually by moderators. They are sweeping it all under the rug because it does not suit their narrative. \n\n**Feminism**\n\nLast post about her domestic abuse case was three years ago. Highlight post:\n\n>The Internet\u2019s Reaction to Amber Heard\u2019s Domestic Violence Case is Proof of Why More Victims Don\u2019t Come Forward\n\nJust like TwoX, they are deleting everything about her abusive nature.\n\n**MensLib** (yes, this is a women's community)\n\nLast post was a couple of months ago, which is even more shameless than TwoX and Feminism: the moderator team asks the users there to give Amber Heard the benefit of the doubt. They pussyfoot around the fact that we have her, on tape, discussing at length exactly how she committed horrific abuse against Johnny Depp. The users jump on to claim there is no \"perfect victim\" of domestic violence. \n\n**GenderCritical**\n\nBizarrely, the most honest of the bunch. A post three days ago agrees that Amber Heard abused Depp, but then immediately jumps into apologetics with \"bUt WoMeN ArE KiLLed bY mEn eVeRY dAy.\"\n\n>But fucking hell what a hypocrisy is it to keep talking about Amber and Johnny while domestic violence is a problem that affects and KILLS women EVERY DAY, all around the world. Majority of victims are WOMEN. Majority of physical abusers are MALE.\n\nIf you CAPITALIZE random words, it MAKES your argument more CONVINCING.\n\n**Why is this related to men's rights?**\n\nWomen are not held accountable, and they are held accountable by other women the least. The largest feminist communities on reddit, and therefore the largest feminist communities on the Internet outside of Twitter, are either (1) censoring posts about Heard's violence or (2) justifying them. \n\nHold women accountable.\n\nEdit: as this post goes on, more and more people are getting confused. Nobody is saying that women's communities need to talk about every case of women abusing men. The case of Amber Heard abusing Johnny Depp, however, is one where they allowed posters to talk about how Depp abused her, but are now refusing the actual facts of the case to be posted. This is an active effort to **hide the facts of the case once they became too inconvenient.**","title":"If you search for \"Amber Heard\" on women's subreddits, what do you find?

Society has no problem endlessly abusing men, but now that feminists are trying to abuse little boys things may get sticky.   Most people aren't aware that schools have already been changed to privilege girls (See CH Sommers' \"War Against Boys\"); if they were aware of this we would undoubtedly see more pissed off mothers and fathers.   This time they're doing it right out in the open.   These disgusting harpies and their billionaire\/state backers actually have the gall to tell boys they are abusive privileged oppressors even as they're being drugged with Ritalin and systematically disadvantaged in the education system.   These boys are just learning how to ride a bike for Fuck's sake~!   \n\nFeminist indoctrination is not so terrible in highschool because the kids can just do a google search and easily debunk eg the wage gap.  But the Australian government is trying to teach this shit to boys (and girls) as young as **six*.**   Ironically these lessons were supposedly designed to reduce male on female domestic violence (apparently the reverse doesn't count), even though the Duluth model has long since been discredited.   So their brilliant plan is to engage in the mass mental abuse of boys at the age when they are most vulnerable and when boys are *already* disadvantaged in schools.   Could you imagine a male teacher bullying six year old girls like this?   How pathetic does a person have to be to bully children?   \n\nEdit: Since the particulars of the program itself are not mentioned in this article here is another one: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-australia-37640353\n\n>A guide for the Year 7 and 8 curriculum states: \"Being born a male, you have advantages - such as being overly represented in the public sphere - and this will be true whether you personally approve or think you are entitled to this privilege.\"  [Also over-represented in privileged spheres like workplace accidents and deaths -- about 95% if memory serves]\n\n>It describes privilege as \"automatic, unearned benefits bestowed upon dominant groups\" based on \"gender, sexuality, race or socio-economic class\" [interesting that socio-economic class is placed last on the privilege hierarchy, even though it is by far the most important indicator of actual \"privilege\" -- to the extent that we can even quantify such nebulous concepts; I wonder if that's because most feminists are middle and upper class?].   \n\n>Year 11 and 12 students are introduced to the concept of \"hegemonic masculinity\" which \"requires boys and men to be heterosexual, tough, athletic and emotionless, and encourages the control and dominance of men over women\".  [Excuse me, *requires* men to be heterosexual?   Have these idiots not watched a wild life video?  Are feminists suggesting that we pray the hetero away via feminism like religious fundamentalists demand that gays \"pray the gay away?\"   How in the fuck is this shit being taught in schools?  Nevermind creationism: feminism is the new \"Jesus rode a Dinosaur\"]\n\n>Pay inequality, anger management, sexual orientation and the dangers of pornography [porn is actually strongly correlated with a decrease in violence, sexual or otherwise, against women] will be among the topics explored by students in the programme, costing A$21.8m (\u00a313.5m; $16.5m).   [Gee that money was well spent.   I think it would have been better spent on programs for Australian Aboriginal peoples.   They have the highest rates of domestic violence in Australia -- not due to \"toxic masculinity\" -- but dispossession, poverty and despair.  I think I just blew an intersectional feminist's mind.]\n\nEdit two: Some people have pointed out that this is nothing new (though this takes it to the next level -- I would have assumed that Canadians, Brits or Swedes would have beaten you Aussie cunts to the feminist punch).   As most boys who went to school during the 90's and after can attest, degrading and humiliating little boys is par for the course in modern \"education\" systems.   \n\nIn this article (published in the Guardian no less), the novelist Dorris Lessing (herself a feminist!) condemns a \"female culture that revels in humiliating the other sex.\"   \n\n>\"I was in a class of nine- and 10-year-olds, girls and boys, and this young woman was telling these kids that the reason for wars was the innately violent nature of men.\n\n>\"You could see the little girls, fat with complacency and conceit while the little boys sat there crumpled, apologising for their existence, thinking this was going to be the pattern of their lives.\"\n\n>Lessing said the teacher tried to \"catch my eye, thinking I would approve of this rubbish\".\n\n>She added: \"This kind of thing is happening in schools all over the place and no one says a thing.\n\n>\"It has become a kind of religion that you can't criticise because then you become a traitor to the great cause, which I am not.\n\n>\"It is time we began to ask who are these women who continually rubbish men. The most stupid, ill-educated and nasty woman can rubbish the nicest, kindest and most intelligent man and no one protests.\n\n>**\"Men seem to be so cowed that they can't fight back, and it is time they did.\"**\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\/2001\/aug\/14\/edinburghfestival2001.edinburghbookfestival2001","title":"Signs of sanity: Australians outraged over abusive \"male privilege\" lessons to be taught at schools to little boys; teachers vowing not to teach the hateful feminist curriculum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/57re9u\/signs_of_sanity_australians_outraged_over_abusive\/"}

See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/UnpopularFacts\/comments\/ght5dj\/teachers\\_mark\\_girls\\_higher\\_for\\_identical\\_work\\_to\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/UnpopularFacts\/comments\/ght5dj\/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to\/)\n\nThis is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.\n\nNote; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....\n\n**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and \"male norms\" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is \"female norms\" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1\/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.\n\n[https:\/\/www.tes.com\/news\/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd](https:\/\/www.tes.com\/news\/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[https:\/\/www.lifesitenews.com\/news\/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds](https:\/\/www.lifesitenews.com\/news\/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds)\n\nCornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *\u201ccommensurately graded by their teachers\u201d* in any subject *\u201cas their test scores would predict.\u201d*\n\nThe answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.\n\nBoys are falling significantly behind in grades, *\u201cdespite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.\u201d*\n\nAfter fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *\u201ca teacher\u2019s subjective assessment of the student\u2019s performance\u201d*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *\u201csocio-emotional skills.\u201d*This has had a significant impact on boys\u2019 later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child\u2019s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.\n\nEliminating the factor of *\u201cnon-cognitive skills\u2026almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades\u201d*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *\u201csurprising\u201d* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.\n\nThe report also found that:\n\n* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.\n* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.\n\n**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1\/3 for 13 year old boys.

I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety \u2013 and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex\n\nBy the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media\/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender\u2019s triumph \u2013 never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/education\/11364130\/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn\u2019t dare.\n\nAlong with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century.

As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys.

Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.\n\nBoys are falling significantly behind in grades, *\u201cdespite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.\u201d*\n\nAfter fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *\u201ca teacher\u2019s subjective assessment of the student\u2019s performance\u201d*,   and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results.   Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *\u201csocio-emotional skills.\u201d*   This has had a significant impact on boys\u2019 later achievement because,   while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned  grades  that determine a child\u2019s future with class placement, high  school  graduation and college admissibility.\n\nEliminating the factor of *\u201cnon-cognitive skills\u2026almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades\u201d*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *\u201csurprising\u201d* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.\n\nThe report also found that:\n\n* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.\n* At  secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen  steadily at  first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in  2012.\n\n**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher.

Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships  and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single  degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for  example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting  girls but doing nothing for boys\n\n[https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2019\/11\/05\/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school\/](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2019\/11\/05\/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:\n\n[https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/men\/thinking-man\/11668169\/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/men\/thinking-man\/11668169\/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)\n\nI do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the  1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to  raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at  least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades  of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in  class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral  dubiety \u2013 and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class  treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for  those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never  seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex\n\nBy the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist  commentators in the media\/political establishment who celebrated the  rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that  females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook  boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education  system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender\u2019s triumph \u2013 never  acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at  the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in  the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/education\/11364130\/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn\u2019t dare.\n\nAlong with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this  feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has  characterised their outlook for the last half century. Have you ever met  a man who was fretting anxiously that his own son\/s were being unfairly  treated at school?","title":"Teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work to boys (OECD study).

What she had done was against more than a few rules and would have resulted in her getting kicked out of the military.  When I was first informed I was horrified, upset, and angry.  After speaking with counselors and a defense attorney I came to terms with it.  If law enforcement did their jobs they'll figure out pretty quickly she's lying to deflect from her own behavior and I can move on with my life.  Unfortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth.  \n\nFor those unfamiliar with military justice system, when a member is accused of wrong doing that particular branches law enforcement agency investigates.  Their job is not to prove or disprove the accusation, just collect the facts.  The results of investigation are handed to the JAG office, and from there it is decided if they want to pursue charges.  In the civilian world this is the equivalent of someone reporting a crime to the police, and the police investigating.  Unless there is overwhelming evidence a civilian is not usually immediately charged with the crime.  While law enforcement conducts the investigation the accused goes on with their daily life.  Not so in the military.\n\nI was placed on an administrative hold.  What does this mean?  It means my career is at an absolute standstill until the investigation is completed.  I was supposed to promote six months ago, but still haven't.  Having to explain to friends and family why I wasn't promoted was a real treat.  The admin hold also means no TDY's, no formal training schools, nothing to help or advance my career or my job proficiency.   This ordeal has cost me no less than 15k in pay.  To say that my mental state is an absolute fucking disaster is an  understatement.  Crippling depression, weight loss \/ weight gain, PTSD, anxiety and a whole host of other issues.  My girlfriend is a therapist and she gave me a list of her professional observations of what I've gone through and what will be needed in the future to help me get over this.  It's going to take a long time.  \n\nI have been put through hell over this.  The \"investigation\" has been going on for more than 8 months.  My life has been on hold for 8 months and NOBODY GIVES A SHIT.  Here are the following things I have heard:\n\nThe female will suffer ZERO repercussions for lying.  NONE!  I can literally prove she stated multiple lies in her initial statement.  As of right now they PCS'd her to a new duty station of her choice \"to protect her\".  We weren't even at the same fucking base and have different career fields!  There was zero chance of us ever interacting.  Before this accusation she was on the fast track to discharge.  Now, nobody cares what she did before.  Only that some evil man raped her and she needs to be protected.  Now that she's under a different chain of command they have decided she has a \"clean slate\" and all her previous issues are gone.  Her new command is not going to pursue charges against her, even though her former command requested they do so.  She got exactly what she wanted.  She was even promoted ... ya know ... the same thing I've been denied.  hy accuser has actually committed multiple crimes under the UCMJ which I could file charges against her for.  I've been told they wont pursue charges because anything I claim, regardless of how truthful it is or how much evidence I can show, will be seen as a retaliation and not taken seriously.  \n\nNobody is going to be held accountable for how I've been treated, the damage to my mental state, career, or financial well being.  I've already lost 15k in pay, and that number gets higher with every passing day.  I have suffered greatly and I haven't even been charged with a crime.  The best I can do is go after her in civil court for defamation of character, which would more than likely loose me money even if I won the case.  My attorney even stated I'd be paying thousands of dollars just to make a point on principle.  I have been told by multiple high ranking parties that when this is over that I am just supposed to BE GRATEFUL that its done with and move on with my life.  Apparently, people can lie and fuck up your life and I'm just supposed to smile and be thankful I'm not being sent to prison over a crime I didn't commit.  \n\nI held off for 6 months before finally admitting I had massive mental health concerns and started counseling.   I have been having suicidal thoughts and am smart enough to know I need to nip that shit in the bud now.  My Commander told me that JAG  and Law enforcement see this as me trying to garner sympathy, or that I have a guilty conscience.  They literally told my commander this when they spoke!  The US Military has a suicide epidemic right now and when a member seeks out help it seen negatively.  Unbelievable.  \n\nSeveral friends have been interviewed by law enforcement.  They are required to sign NDA's before leaving so they couldn't specifically discuss anything with me.  However, two of those members contacted my defense attorney to request to testify in my defense if this goes to court martial.  Not just because they know the truth, but more so because of how disgusted with law enforcement they were.  As stated, specifics couldn't be discussed, but they told my attorney that law enforcement was incredibly biased against me to a remarkable degree.  One friend even said the interviewer said my name \"with disgust in her voice\".  The questions they were asked were not open ended, or the kind you would ask if you wanted someones side of the story\/perspective.  They were all leading and an obvious attempt to say anything to incriminate me.  One even said when they attempted to tell what they knew about the situation, which was in my defense, investigators tried to cut her off and accused her of lying for me.   It was not collecting facts in the least.  My First Sergeant told me investigators got angry with him because he advised me of my rights and not to speak to them without my attorney present.  They actually cursed him out when they interviewed him simply because he told me what my rights were.  For context of how bad this must have been, one of the girls requesting to testify on my behalf is an ex, and before this she hated my guts.  I know she still dislikes me, but even she couldn't sit idly by while my life is torn to shreds.  I don't deserve that.\n\nI'm sorry for the rant, but I can't talk to anyone about this.  Anything I say to anyone can be used against me, regardless of what I say or the context.  Any time I reach out for help I'm told it looks bad.  More than anything I'm angry about the injustice of it all.  I haven't even been charged with a crime and I feel crippled.  I'm scared to death.  I just want this nightmare over.  What's sad is they've won.  When this is all over, I'll be so happy I can go back to my life that I won't care that this whole ordeal has been biased and left me with crippling anxiety and PTSD.  Its crushed my soul and I haven't felt any kind of happiness in months.  It's destroyed my career, friendship, and relationships.  I have no faith whatsoever in the US Military anymore after this, but can't leave or I'd forgo all retirement benefits.  This is the military \"Justice System\" that is totally, definitely not biased.","title":"I've Been Falsely Accused of Sexual Assault , My Life Has Become A Living Hell and Nobody Cares","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/elrg5k\/ive_been_falsely_accused_of_sexual_assault_my\/"}

I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors\/social workers\/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. \n\nShe took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be \"fixed\" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. \n\nFlash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I \"don't fit in\" and that my \"views are better suited elsewhere.\" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.\n\nI have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.\n\nEdit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.\n\nThe list:\n-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said \"I didn't see the point\" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; \"there are too many of you and only one of me\" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)\n-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me \"you can't say that!!\" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings. But of course that doesn't go both ways)","title":"Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/b04wtm\/lost_my_job_because_i_was_targeted_for_being_a\/"}

I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. \n\nTonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. \n\nAfter a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text\/posting like crazy. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. \n\nSo for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered \"creepy\" by doing my job. \n\nThe officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. \n\nUpdate #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me \"that is utter bullshit\" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!\n\nUpdate #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car. \n  \n\nUpdate #3, It has been over a month since I filed my complaint over be handcuffed, detained, questioned, and background checked. So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers. Well over 45 minutes being put on, on and off hold, I was told that there is no record of the report. I have the report number and they can't seem to find it. I guess this is my answer, it never happened.

I was denied bond 11 times and I developed major health concerns. \n\nAs to the girl who did this? Yeah, we hooked up, but, I didn\u2019t know she was married. When her husband found out, she didn\u2019t want to admit she was a whore so she said I \u201craped her\u201d. My DNA was never found, there was NO evidence even supporting something occurred, there were no \u201creproductive injuries\u201d no physical injuries, not even a bruise. \n\nAt trial, I was found not guilty of one of my charges, the others were a hung jury. My attorney asked the judge to dismiss the rest of the charges because the statements based on her accusation were \u201cinherently incredible and so manifestly false reasonable men ought not to believe it\u201d\u2026 the judge agreed 10000% and dismissed my charges, I was released 12 hours later.\n\nIf you experienced what I just did, what would you do?

And as it often happens in crowded places there was a line for the ladies room and almost none to the men's room. \n\nThe particular restroom was located at the World of Disney store.  The men's room was busy, all the urinals were occupied but two toilet stalls were open.  I went into a stall and was doing my business.  I heard the door open and someone announced: \"woman coming in\".  I have seen this happen before when a female custodian comes in to the men's room to clean.\n\nThis woman walks directly to an open stall.  She announces \"I am not waiting in that line.\"  Followed by \"Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before\".  \n\nAfter she finishes her business, she walks over to the sink again announcing \"Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before\", washes her hands and then walks out.  All the men in there kinda looked at each other like \"what just happened here\"?\n\nThis woman not only disrespected every man that was in the men's room at that time, she also disrespected every woman waiting in line.  Worst of all, she got away with it. \n\nImagine if a man did exactly what she did by going into a busy ladies room.","title":"A woman barges into a busy men's room at Disney World and uses the toilet because she did not want to wait in line to use the ladies room.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/pkaqhd\/a_woman_barges_into_a_busy_mens_room_at_disney\/"}

Divorce was amicable at first but their mom met a guy on Tinder and went off the deep end. She began accusing me of domestic abuse and calling the cops on me all in an effort to take full custody and move 400 miles away to be with her Tinder guy. It resulted in a settlement out of court giving me primary custody and her secondary custody with her paying very little to no child support.\n\nIn the intervening years she failed to utilize a large chunk of custody and ultimately the Tinder guy died under mysterious circumstances. Almost as soon as he died she began showing interest in the kids and we started to communicate and get along. Not a full month after Tinder guy died she was already shacking up with a new guy that supposedly had lots of money. He seemed like a decent guy if not a little immature. Anyways, she told the kids she was moving back locally and everything was groovy up until she got pregnant with his kid and decided she wanted custody of the kids.\n\nWe all met for lunch and she sprung the information she was pregnant and wasn't planning to move back to our home state and that she wanted primary custody of my son only. When I had a chance to get the kids in the car and speak to both my ex and her boyfriend in private I said in the most polite way possible that they can get fucked. This resulted in Rich Boy threatening me with his family's deep pockets. Once I got home with the kids I texted my ex wife to let her know I appreciated us getting along for a few months and would like to see it continue that way and that going to court would not end well for her and ultimately be a waste of money for the both of us. I got served court papers a month later stating I molested my daughter and that mom wanted primary custody and child support.\n\nFlash forward until today after almost 2 years of me being in constant anxiety and fear we had our final hearing. My ex attended via Zoom and was already turning on the water works. We had the hearing and the judge ruled in my favor 100%. He saw through her bullshit and didn't have time for it. He awarded me every single penny I spent on litigation (almost 10 grand) and child support of 900\/mo.\n\nHonestly I feel disoriented, I'm stunned. Best part is, she quit her job 2 weeks ago thinking if she wasn't working they wouldn't order her to pay child support. Judge wasn't having any of that bullshit either. First payment is due 10\/1 and she has to turn over court fees in 90 days. I guess hubby and his deep pockets will have to handle this one...","title":"After 2 years, I finally won my custody case after being accused of molesting my daughter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MensRights\/comments\/iyo1dx\/after_2_years_i_finally_won_my_custody_case_after\/"}

It is called the The program is called *The Female Offender Diversion Project pilot.* [Here's another article](https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-gb\/news\/uknews\/hundreds-of-female-criminals-including-thieves-and-drug-users-will-be-spared-jail-under-a-pilot-scheme-to-tackle-reoffending\/ar-AAHorN1) on it.\n\nIt's worth noting that the London Deputy of policing and crime, Sophie Linden, is former Hackney MP who tried passing a [1000 pound fine](https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/8gkne3\/criminalising-the-homeless-is-a-new-low-for-london-733) for being homeless.\n\nIn my opinion, this is very troubling and disingenuous. This is a blatant discrimination and indefensible inequality. It is creating a separate justice system for men and women where a man is automatically treated worse simply for being male. It is direct inequality under law- this is creating a two-tiered justice system where a male and female offender are automatically treated differently simply for their gender. The arguments given are very illogical and really don't hold up:\n\n>Research found women more likely to reoffend than men after a short sentence\n\nSo why is this a justification for *more*lenient treatment? This makes absolutely no sense as a reason,. If anything, if males were more likely to re-offend, it would be said that they deserve *harsher* punishment because of it.\n\nAnd couldn't it be likely  that female offenders offend more *because* they receive more lenient treatment *to begin with*. This has been the [standard legal practice](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/politics\/2018\/06\/26\/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent\/) in the UK for over a year...so wouldn't it make sense that the group that knows they face less consequences would be more likely to re-offend? [This article](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-45512468) is an example of that, a woman repeated arrested for shoplifting saying she does it over and over again because the consequences are so minor.\n\nI did some research, and found [this powerpoint from the Ministry of Justice](https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/759772\/women-cjs-2017-statistics-infographic.pdf). It disputes the argument that women are more likely to offend...on the bottom right, you'll see the rates for reoffending is *higher* for males (31%) than females (23%)\n\nSo that that argument is based on statistics that aren't even true. Either way, still a poor argument IMO.\n\n>The move to help 1,000 female criminals over the next two years has been launched by London Mayor Sadiq Khan after research found women are more likely than men to be sent to prison for a first-time offence.\n\nThis is extremely unlikely to be true, given the above...in fact, it's logically impossible...it's actually the law to exempt women from prison for minor offenses, and has been for a year...there is absolutely no way female offenders are more likely to be sent to prison for a first offense than male offenders. I would like to see that data publicly. Even so, it's not a justification for a separate and distinct legal system.\n\n>Shoplifters, drug users, thieves and low-level offenders will instead be referred to specialist services for help with mental health problems and substance abuse.\n\nBut if the issue is to address factors like mental health and substance abuse, why make it a gendered program? Why not make it a program that focuses on mental health and drug offenses? The argument that women are \"more likely\" to be affected by those things doesn't hold water, because under this program, a woman who *isnt* affected by one of these factors still benefits from the program, while a man who *is* affected wouldn't, simply for his gender. There's no sense in making it a law that treats gender as an absolute. In fact, doesn't so is blatantly discriminatory. To grant 50% of the population automatic immunity from prison for theft is absurd.\n\n>A lack of a women\u2019s prison in London means women are taken further away from their families and support networks, which makes the process of rehabilitation more difficult and women entering custody are at high risk of losing their accommodation and having significantly worse employment outcomes than men\n\nThis argument is absurd...the problem then would be the lack of women's prisons in London. This feels setup, for the past few years there have been [calls to close women's prisons](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2016\/jun\/01\/why-we-should-close-womens-prisons-and-treat-their-crimes-more-fairly). Now this has happened, it's being presented as a reason why women need to be treated *even more* leniently.\n\nSo now, a woman with no mental health issues or drug issues who steals will be automatically spared prison, whereas a homeless man who is starving who shoplifts will be sent to prison.  50% of the population of London now knows they can commit theft with impunity from prison. This seems like a very dangerous circumstance.","title":"London has a new program to automatically exempt women from jail for certain crimes.

Currently, I get every other weekend, and 1 day a week. In the summer, I got them overnight for that day. \n\nI had not received the order from the judge yet, but my ex did. Not only did I not receive full custody, or joint custody, but the court decided that my son's and I didn't need that overnight in the summer anymore. \n\nAfter she geelfully told me that had changed, I started thinking about my and many other fathers situation.\n\n I am a slave.\n\n I am forced to pay my ex wife, and the courts use the love I have for my children to keep me paying. I can't leave, because my kids need their Dad. I also cant leave because the state will do their best to get me back here. I cannot stop paying, because that is illegal.

This act is  gender quota for women on public boards. When you read the actual measures and provisions, it's completely one sided and allows for discrimination against men. Men have no protection under this measure.\n\nEssentially, the measure requires all public boards to have at least 50% women. [Having *more* then 50% women is also encouraged, however.](https:\/\/www.gov.scot\/publications\/gender-representation-public-boards-scotland-act-2018-statutory-guidance\/pages\/2\/).

The Act does not require board non-executive membership to be precisely 50:50 men and women and it does not prevent a board having more than 50% of non-executive members who are women. **A board with more than 50% of non-executive members who are women has met the objective.**\n\nAdded emphasis mine- this makes it clear that having more women than men, by any amount, is considered a success.\n\nThe measure requires a woman to be chosen over an equally qualified man if it brings the percentage of women closer to 50%. However, as was made clear above, this does not apply for men when they are under 50%. So even if men are only 40% of a board, it's still permissible to hire a woman over an equally qualified man.\n\n[Here's the section on the application process](https:\/\/www.gov.scot\/publications\/gender-representation-public-boards-scotland-act-2018-statutory-guidance\/pages\/3\/)\n\n[>However, in circumstances where there are two or more equally qualified candidates, at least one of whom is a woman, then section 4(2) of the Act requires the appointing person to give preference to a woman if doing so will result in the board achieving (or making progress towards achieving) the gender representation objective. This is, however, subject to section 4(4).](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/utrmptX)\n\n[>If there are at least 2 equally qualified candidates, one of whom is a woman, then the appointing person must appoint the woman if doing so would result in the board achieving (or making progress to achieving) the gender representation objective. This is subject to the provision at section 4(4) of the Act **which requires the appointing person to consider whether the appointment of an equally qualified candidate who is not a woman would be justified on the basis of a \"characteristic or situation\" particular to that candidate and allows appointment of that candidate**.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/KnO049M)\n\nAdded emphasis mine- it means that even if a man *is* equally qualified, he must specifically be able to prove why it is appropriate or necessary to add him. So in practice, it means a woman will almost always be considered more qualified than a man (as always works with these things.) So it'll be easy for boards to become 70-80% women, and men have absolutely zero legal protection.\n\nSo let's just take a look at [what this will actually look like](https:\/\/www.gov.scot\/publications\/gender-representation-public-boards-scotland-act-2018-statutory-guidance\/pages\/7\/). I think this paragraph sums it up well:\n\n[>If, at the time of recruitment, the gender representation objective has been achieved, the requirements at section 3 and 4 of the Act will not apply unless the appointment will result in the lapsing of the gender representation objective. For example, if a board has 6 female board members and 3 male members and is recruiting to replace one of the female board members there would be no obligation to appoint a woman in a tie break situation (i.e. where there are at least 2 equally qualified candidates, one of whom is a woman). However, if at the time of the appointment round the board has equal numbers of female and male non-executive members and the board is recruiting to replace one of the female members, then section 3 and 4 would apply with a view to achieving the gender representation objective after the replacement had been appointed.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/RreTEQh)\n\nSo, if there are 6 women and 3 men, that's not a violation, it's just that \"oh, well, a man is allowed to be hired now.\" But if it's 5 men and 4 woman, a woman *must* be hired over a man.\n\nMy guess is this law will stay on the books indefinitely. Feminists will say now \"oh, it's just temporary to achieve equality\", but come the time when most boards are vast majority female and men are significantly underrepresented, if anyone tries to point out how the law is very outdated and unfair, feminists will say \"you're just trying to undo progress by women!\"","title":"Scotland's new gender quota law directly discriminates against men.
