I just felt that ppl who Identify as they\/them tend to make everything about themselves and their struggles as if the LGBT wasn't outcasts enough. Seems like they try to outcast themselves from the outcast and then complain that everyone is outcasting them and that's why I feel it's exhausting talk and socialize with the they\/thems in my friend group. I've noticed this in other non binary people as well.  \n\nEdit#2: someone in the comments compared it to vegans. \"It's not the fact that they are vegans , it's the fact they make *I'm vegan* their whole personality. \" ","title":"What's the deal with the LGBT community.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18daq9b\/whats_the_deal_with_the_lgbt_community\/"}

Visiting the sub I saw that the content there is very dehumanizing and degrading towards people with BPD under the guise of being an \"abuse support group\".  IMO the subreddit is a hate-sub and should be banned.\n\n------------------\n\nSo, a friend of mine has been diagnosed with [Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Borderline_personality_disorder).  He's been having a really difficult time adjusting to the diagnosis because, naturally, therapy and self-reflection can be difficult to undergo - but also because he's now being exposed to a lot of the stigma associated with BPD.\n\nBPD can cause a person to be prone to problems with relationships and with emotional regulation.  They are also prone to volatile, impulsive, dangerous and\/or controlling behavior that can negatively affect people close to them.  Thus the stigma associates people with BPD with manipulative, controlling, inappropriate and abusive behavior.\n\nLike any mental illness, BPD does not define a person.  It can sometimes be difficult to treat, but people with BPD are not by any means irredeemable.  They are full people.  It's bizarre that this even has to be said, but if you say it over on \/r\/bpdlovedones, you're breaking [rule 4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BPDlovedones\/wiki\/rules#wiki_rule_.234.3A_acceptable_behavior_and_tone):\n\n>Your post\/comment sounds like, \"But not all BPDs are like that!\" or \"But what about the BPDs?\" or \"But BPD is curable!\" These types of statements belong in \/r\/BPDSOFFA.\n\nI found this sub the other day when my friend with BPD sent me a post from there.  I won't link it directly to try and avoid causing a raid (please do not participate in the referenced threads), but I will post the text:\n\n>I don't interact with people who have BPD, and I don't care how bad that sounds\n\n...\n\n>It's like if you took away half a person's ability to reason and understand the world and were left with this explosive, animal like person. I don't see these people as being like others, and I can now (after being burned by some very volatile individuals) finally see people like this clear as day and I stay far away from them.  \n>  \n>Does anyone else relate? I'm tired of acting like people with BPD deserve the same attention that someone with PTSD, or OCD, or dissociation (or no mental illness at all) and that we can all just pretend that having borderline as a mental illness doesn't immediately mean you should be avoided at all costs.\n\n...\n\n>I'm no longer towing the safe space line that I shouldn't stigmatize the mental disorder. There is a reason why there is stigma!\n\nThis thread has 233 upvotes.  The comments are filled with general assent.  The post has not been deleted or locked.  This kind of post does not represent some fringe post that snuck by the moderators - this sort of talk is all over the sub.\n\nBy the way, if you have BPD you are *forbidden* by [rule 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BPDlovedones\/wiki\/rules#wiki_rule_.231.3A_who_can_.28and_can.2019t.29_participate_here) to defend yourself from this sweeping generalization or to assert that you are in fact \"like others\" and not \"animal-like\".  In fact, you are forbidden from posting there at all, as is anyone else with any other personality disorder.\n\nThe subreddit justifies this by claiming that it's an \"abuse support forum\" for people who have suffered abuse at the hands of someone with BPD, and I do think this is what it's trying to be.  It's clear most of the posters there are trying to heal from experiences with people they at least *think* have BPD.  But instead of being centered around the abuse that's been suffered, the community instead revolves around a *mental illness* possessed - or suspected to be possessed - by the abuser.  So instead of being focused on sufferers and their healing, posts focus on dog-piling people with BPD, and users project behaviors of individuals - many of whom are \\*not diagnosed with BPD\\* - onto BPD people as a whole.\n\nResources on navigating relationships with people with BPD are important, but there are resources out there that don't rely on dehumanizing BPD people in the process.  At the same time, resources on dealing with BPD *for BPD people* is also important - but can tend to get mixed in with or even drowned out by more hostile posts.  Being diagnosed with BPD and looking for ways to cope, only to find hateful posts calling you an \"animal\" - as my friend did - is not exactly great for an already fragile sense of self and fear of abandonment.\n\n\/r\/bpdlovedones frankly ought to qualify as a hate-sub, and is identified as bannable by rule 1 of Reddit's [Content Policy](https:\/\/www.redditinc.com\/policies\/content-policy):\n\n>Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\n\nA \"vulnerability\" is [defined by Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddithelp.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360045715951) as follows:\n\n>Marginalized or vulnerable groups include, but are not limited to, groups based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability.\n\nBPD is a mental illness, officially categorized as a disability by the Social Security Administration, whose sufferers have been allowed to be called \"animal-like\" on a public forum.\n\nI'm curious what other people think about this.  To me it's very clearly hateful and against TOS and ought to be banned.  It promotes stigma against people with a mental illness and drowns out productive resources.  What are other peoples' feelings about this?","title":"\/r\/BPDLovedOnes is a hate-sub","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/igsn46\/rbpdlovedones_is_a_hatesub\/"}

I am referring to a person who harbors excessive body fat, lives a mostly static life, and consumes very high levels of calories that are superfluous to the individuals lifestyle i.e., they eat excessively without expending the extra calories. So I am not referring to athletes, and this post is mostly a representation of my opinion on western obesity.  \n\nI want to express that I do not condone the persecution of any plussed size people, nor am I claiming that just because a person is obese that they cannot be happy. I am also not talking about someone who is just slightly overweight. Who I am referring to is a person who would be classified as morbidly obese. My view is specifically that when an obese person claims they are happy with their weight, they are forming that view from a position of resignation and defeat. Thus, to cope with a seemingly personal defeat and a perceived insurmountable problem, an obese person will vehemently proclaim to be happy with the very thing that causes them anguish.\n\nThe body positivity movement isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing, and I do believe it is necessary for some people e.g., people with physical deformities, conspicuous skin conditions, hair loss or excessive hair growth, etc.; all of these are things one cannot control, and one should not be ostracized for such superficial differences. Obesity, on the other hand, is more of a controllable condition.\n\nI will start with the elephant in the room\u2026 genetics. Yes, there are undoubtedly genetic reasons why one may be more inclined to put on weight easier; however, this is not a sentence to a life of obesity, nor is it a good reason to not put forth effort to managing one\u2019s weight. Just because something is hard, it doesn\u2019t mean its not worth pursuing. Weight is determined by more than just genetics; it is mostly determined by diet and the quality of food consumed, physical activity, and the amount of food consumed versus how many calories are burned i.e., being in a caloric deficit. \\*Therefore, due to obesity being a physical trait that is very controllable and not impossible to change, trying to incorporate obesity into the body positivity movement is a misguided notion.\n\nTragedy, seeking comfort, and decadence are major contributors as to why people can find themselves on the heavier side of the scale\u2019s numbers; because of these reasons, I find obesity to be the result of some unchecked mental disorder. If one suffers a traumatic experience (especially as a child), they may seek comfort in food. Oher stressor could exist in one\u2019s life, or just simple loneliness, that could drive one to food. With how little physical effort day to day life requires, compounded with the fact most people who have excess will indulge (usually from boredom), could cause a decline in the appreciation of physical effort, and thus one can fall into excessive decadence. All the foregoing are not qualities of a person who is happy and of sound mind.\n\nThere are other reasons why one may struggle with their weight, such as mood, self-confidence, social setting, economic status, etc.; all of these are things that may be hard to overcome, but they are things people are able to control these things i.e., things that people can take actions to try and change them. I could go on and explain these things in more detail, but I would rather take them on in the comments to avoid prolixity\u2026 which I may be failing at currently. So, I will end with this: does anybody really believe it when they hear an obese person says they are content with their weight? Do obese people even believe it when they say they are content with their weight.\n\n\\*I also wish to point out people who are currently trying to lose weight, are losing weight, and are still in the process of attaining a lower weight, are not the type of people I am referring to in my post; these people are actively trying to lose weight and are not trying to act happy about being obese. Further, those people making changes to lose weight should view themselves  positively.\n\n\\*I\u2019ve read a few times that some people who are in the process of changing their weight state they are happy with their body, and I believe that to be partly true; rather what they are happy with is the progress and changes they are seeing in their","title":"Any obese person who claims to be happy about their weight is in deep denial.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/17o1ozf\/any_obese_person_who_claims_to_be_happy_about\/"}

It's also a massive red flag in itself that they demand access to female-only spaces that they know aren't really for them. And it's an imposition on women, to expect us even in the best case to accept our spaces being repurposed as therapeutic settings for dysphoric men.\n\nThe idea that it is \"anti-trans\" or \"transphobic\" to be opposed to this imposition is just a way of attempting to shut women up who object. I won't be guilt tripped. However, I would be interested in hearing your thoughts if you have a reasonable and civil disagreement with this.","title":"It is not \"anti-trans\" for women to want female-only spaces","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18rrhi7\/it_is_not_antitrans_for_women_to_want_femaleonly\/"}

The strikers accused me of trying to run them over and looked like they wanted to fight me. I initially just treated them like they were being ridiculous and moved on to do my job.\n\nAs I was leaving, a security guard told me I could pass a truck to leave. A striker blocked me and said, \u201cdo you fucking know how to wait in line.\u201d I told him the guard told me to pass and he said, \u201cI better not fucking see your face around here ever again.\u201d At this point I screamed \u201cfuck you\u201d at his face and drove off. I overheard screaming from all of them saying I would be dead if I ever came back. I immediately called the police after this and told them the strikers were giving death threats.\n\nAfter that, I called their union and spoke with their vice president. I explained that his people were being aggressive and giving threats to people that had nothing to do with anything. He told me I was lucky not to be killed for being a scab and I was a horrible person for crossing a picket line and I should have just turned around.\n\nI then was really mad and contacted the CEO of the company they were striking against and told his staff about this and I believe their union leader is encouraging potential violence. If people are going to behave this way, I don\u2019t want them to succeed. This is ironic because I absolutely would have supported them if they didn\u2019t act that way. I feel like a hypocrite helping a corporation out but violent people need to be dealt with. Threatening people that have nothing to do with anything is never ok. \n\nI anonymously asked some union members online about proper protocol with other unions strikes and apparently I\u2019m supposed to not work there if it\u2019s not my job striking. I understand this but I simply wasn\u2019t aware at the time. I thought scabbing only applies if it\u2019s your job and other jobs were irrelevant. About 75% of them treated me like I was a horrible person and I deserved to get beaten. It honestly felt like a cult. \n\nIf the strikers initially said, \u201cthis is a strike and we would appreciate it if you turned around and not went through to help us out\u201d when I asked what was going on, I would have called my office and explained I couldn\u2019t do that job. Instead, they chose to act like complete assholes from the beginning falsely accusing me of trying to run them over because I asked what was going on. This eventually escalated to death threats from them.\n\nI\u2019m posting this on a here because I want to see how everyone feels about this situation.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m tired of repeating this but my beliefs didn\u2019t change.

Our options are truly \"pick your plantation\" and we as a country deserve better than that. \n\nSo since reddit leans left let me point out some issues I notice (AKA miss me with the \"but but tHe rIgHt\"): \n\n1. The lesser of two evils nonstop fear mongering to keep people in their place is also bigoted asf. Like telling folks how if they vote for Trump, be ready for Jim Crow and concentration camps. Or how they're not *really* xyz minority if they're conservative. We should be advocating for freedom, not coercing people to fall in line. \n\n2. Poor to working class whites who vote red are NONSTOP told they're garbage voting against their interests - the sole narrative around them since forever is being overwhelmingly bigoted and stupid and voting against their interests lol. Maybe it's time to look deeper into it. \n\n3. It really makes me think deeply about this country's history\/present around voting. Like the subtle to violent oppression over it. Because both parties are basically open arms if someone wants to vote for their party and turn terrible *real* quick if they don't\/they even suspect they don't. There's clearly deep conditioning here. \n\n4. Trying to get people to see there's two distinct white supremacy strains in this country that both need to be pulled by the root is a whole ass job lol. Especially when they feed off the other's existence. The left \"moral high ground\" missionaries are the same exact picture as the right wing christian missionaries - it's time to accept that. \n\n5. Like I said, this is pick your plantation at the end of the day, so villianizing the opposing side is not only unproductive but ultimately unfair. We need to focus more on not only solidarity but actively listen and think about why people choose one plantation over another (psst anything that doesn't frame this on a *human* level is NOT the move).","title":"We need to get serious about a third party option","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18qp344\/we_need_to_get_serious_about_a_third_party_option\/"}

He has passed legislation, that he actively campaigned on, to do just that.

I've lived my whole life in rural PA, grew up fishing, done a little hunting. But fact of the matter is we live in a fossil fueled based world.  The US consumes approximately 19Million Barrels of crude oil a day. \n\n\nThere is no feasible way to change that overnight, the only thing we can do is lesson our need over time, and president Biden has passed legislation to get the ball rolling on doing that with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/house-bill\/3684\n\n\nThis is the most signicant investment in our nations infrastructure in decades. Some of things in this bill include \n\n\nDelivering clean water to more American families by eliminating the nation\u2019s lead service lines.\u00a0 \n\nGetting more Americans access to reliable high-speed internet. \n\nRepairing and rebuilding our roads and bridges \n\nImproving transportation options for millions of Americans and reducing greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history.\n\nUpgrading our nation\u2019s airports and ports to strengthen our supply chains. \n\nMaking the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak.\u00a0\n\n\nBuilding a national network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers\n\n\nInvestments to upgrade and modernize our power grid.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 2: Adressing claims of \"energy Independence\" under Trump.\n\n\nWe consume approx 20 Million barrels of crude oil a day. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.eia.gov\/tools\/faqs\/faq.php?id=33&t=6#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20United%20States,7.3%20billion%20barrels%20of%20petroleum.\n\nThe most we produced under Trump was 13Million in November 2019.

And the US did satisfy some of these definitions under Trump in 2020 \u2014 as it did again in the 11 months of 2021, mostly under Biden, for which we have complete data.\n\nFor example, in both periods, the US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It also produced more primary energy in total than it consumed.\n\nFrom the beginning of Trump's term to the end, the US very much relied on oil from abroad.\n\n","title":"We have reached Record Levels of both natural gas and crude oil production in 2023 under President Biden.

This is mainly about dating so if that's not of interest to you that's fine but just letting you know ahead of time. About me, I am 34-year-old male living in Chicago, 6'0\", fit, European and my dating history is pretty bad, with my relationships just turning to just using me. I would describe myself as average but I do put in a great deal into how I present myself. This is long so I provided a quick summary at the bottom.\r  \n\r  \nI have tried online dating, singles mixers and speed dating all of which amounted to nothing. I got no real matches, with the only ones interacting with me being scammers\/spammers or one response ghosters or women that just were verbally abusive. Singles mixers weren't any better, if I was lucky, I got to say my name before being told they weren't interested or I was outright ignored.  Speed dating was the worst since the interactions I got was pretty poor.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I spoke about this with other men their response was this was their experience as well. Singles mixers were effectively just like middle school dances with men on one side and women on the other and the few men that tried to approach got rejected.\r  \n\r  \nSo I tried to find a solution and I looked for it on Reddit through various dating subreddits, this was a mistake. My own mental health gotten worse with the responses I got, which either were suggestions to do things I have already done which caused a fight or that they had no idea but were certain I am at fault here.\r  \n\r  \nI also noticed a pattern, men who posted lamenting about their difficulties in finding women were often told that they need to make improvements to themselves, go to the gym, get better clothing, see a barber, etc and more often than not without any sort of additional details or photos of them or their profile. If a man made a generalization how they are no good women, they got skewered, their standards are too high, they aren't putting the effort needed, etc.\r  \n\r  \nWoman posting always got support, even if their post was generalizing such as there are no good men in NYC. There was no suggestions or critique at all. I would comment with questions to try and better understand a woman's perspective or view point as to answer my own dilemma and those were met with hostility. I was called names and some women who responded were oddly very defensive as well accusing me of wanting to change their standards when I just wanted to understand their standards. I never seen any assessment that they were doing something wrong even though there wasn't anything more concrete than that.\r  \n\r  \nAll in all my depression at this point was pretty bad. I have a problem that no one even has a hint as to what the root cause of it is nor any suggestions that I haven't already tried to resolve it.\r  \n\r  \nOne day I learned that certain opinions were considered to be highly problematic, akin to touching the third rail. This was in a post someone made advising users to go to offline events organized by dating apps such as Bumble. Users either thanked the poster for bringing these events to their attention and others posted their experience. A woman made a post was it wasn't a good event for her as she just ended up talking to other women as none of the men were \"below her league\" something that she also applied to all women not just herself, she called the men who did try and approach her and other women to be creeps for not \"reading the room\" and staying away from them. Me and two other men made 3 separate comments how these were essentially middle school dances with the women talking amongst each other, rejecting whatever man came up to them. I added into my comment that it seems like women nowadays are very picky and have set standards that are not just high but also unwilling to compromise on any.\r  \n\r  \nI was pretty quickly attacked for my comment, trying to defend myself I linked the earlier comment from the woman echoing the same experience just from the other side. This was then deleted by the mods for \"linking hateful material\" and so was my other comment referring with a warning not to bring it up. I never got a response from the mods how exactly is mentioning a live comment or referring to it was forbidden but the comment in the same post submission was permitted to stay up. After I made this question public that other comment was eventually taken down.\r  \n\r  \nI was told that the opinion that woman nowadays are very picky is problematic and wrong even though my opinion stems from my own experiences and sort of discussion about it was forbidden. It was maddening, imagine you having a problem, trying to self-reassess to no avail, asking others to provide their assessment but again to no avail and then expressing that perhaps the problem you face isn't something you can address yourself but is more dependent others to only be clapped back and told that it is in fact your fault.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I eventually done is go to my public library, hop on to EBSCO and other research sites and look up whatever if any professional research was made into this and found that it does appear that my experiences and opinions were valid.\r  \n\r  \n**Summary:** I have trouble dating, reached out for help but I was told I was at fault and doing things wrong even though no one knew what. I asked if perhaps women are just picky get told you are wrong, an idiot and at fault and dismissed only for my mental health to go down significantly as a result.\r  \n","title":"Men get told they suck, here is my experience.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18ns0ko\/men_get_told_they_suck_here_is_my_experience\/"}

I attribute this to the femification of men in today's society. Due to masculinity being attacked. I do think toxic masculinity is a thing and it should be fought against but I believe the fight against toxic masculinity has slowly became a fight against all masculinity. I feel as if this is why so many disinfranchised men are gravitating towards douche bags like Tate. He's a man who's condoned violence towards women and is an out and out liar when it comes to his life. He lied about being a chess champ, he lied about being a kickboxing world champ. He lied about how he made his money. He lied about how much money he has. He lied about abuse allegations, he lied about why he moved from the UK. His most recent lie is that he's a Muslim. Something he's only saying because he's cancelled in the west so he's trying to set up a fan base somewhere else.\n\n\nI think there's a middle ground when it comes to fighting toxic masculinity. We can teach men that it's okay to feel your emotions and even cry. We can teach men that it's okay to embrace traditionally feminine traits like being nurturing and emotive without teaching them that it's okay to wear make up or nail polish. We can fight against mysoginy but at the same time we can also let men know it's okay to be masculine and to embrace being the protector of the house and someone who's in good enough shape to offer some protection in the case of a worse case scenario. No one's saying dedicate yourself to martial arts but I believe a man should be in decent shape. There is a middle ground that should be reached. \n\nThe problem is the pseudo feminists and alt right are so vocal and close minded that they're isolating eachother into echo chambers. They should instead be meeting in the middle. I'm a feminist but not the modern type that cries over man spreading and women having the right to show their breasts in public. I believe in equality and believe there should be more done to tackle issues facing women such as gender based violence and discrimination as well as issues facing men such as stigma around mental health and toxic masculinity. \n\nDue to people on the far left being so quick to cancel people it's driving more and more men towards douchebags like Tate. The far left is inexplicably emboldening the far right. Imagine being a working class man and you finally get into college or uni and all you hear is that everything in the world is your fault and that you should be ashamed of being a man. Rather than trying to educate people are speaking to virtue signal and come off as being right.  \n\nWhile the far left are partly to blame for the isolation of men, men on the far right must realise that those social justice warriors aren't true liberals and that true liberalism isn't about shaming men but about equality and respect for all and that douchebags like Tate are fakes who exploit your feelings for personal gain. They aren't indicative of real men. Real men are kind but strong, real men protect those around them. Real men show their emotions and are a pillar of support for those around them. Real men can wear pink and they can even listen to harry styles and be feminists. What real men can't be are make up wearing, nail polish wearing guilt infused pathetic social justice warrior simps. \n\n\nAnyways my rants over... Ps I'm a liberal centrist 26 year old ex Muslim Asian living in the UK. I love philosophy especially stocisim and Buddhism. I'm not a alt righter nor am I a social justice warrior. I'm just a guy stuck in the middle expressing my thoughts so please don't come at me with attacks.","title":"Andrew Tate is a disingenuous narcissist.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18cjd7w\/andrew_tate_is_a_disingenuous_narcissist\/"}

I was born in a muslim country and continue to live in one.\n\nEver since I grew up, I have been hearing what is appropriate for women to wear in public and which parts of the body they can expose. I have seen great diversity in perspectives on modesty. \nThe amusing thing is, no matter where folks set their modesty bar, they always seem to think that whatever parts women choose to show must be for attention. It can be eyes, face, hair, hands, arms(some tolerate exposing half and oppose wearing sleeveless tops), neck, shoulders, midriff, back(depends on how much is exposed), legs(contingent upon length of skirt or short). The conception changes within families and cities. From one individual to the other. It is primarily set by family and then broader culture in addition to being heavily influenced by religiosity and social status. It even varies by events and places.\n\n\nLately, I've been coming across quite a bit of red-pilled and conservative content online regarding this issue. This content is exposed to a diverse audience, so I expected people to differ. However, contrary to my expectation, men from entirely different cultural backgrounds were endorsing the notion that women must dress according to their partner's preferences and show respect for them. What's insane is the fact that many of these men have their female relatives wearing clothes, which would be found immodest by the very same men consuming the same content.\n\n\nI have argued with a lot of them. It just seems that none of them are ready to comprehend the gravity of accepting that their understanding of modesty is subjective and culturally relevant, if they recognise that it is subjective and culturally relevant in the first place. Most of the time, I honestly feel like these morons are throwing punches in air or attacking some boogeyman named immodesty. \n\n\nWhy don't these men let women wear what they want. All women won't choose to dress similarly. They can then choose to marry a woman who they believe dresses per their expectation. Why don't these men work on their insecurity instead of demanding women to alter their apparel. Why don't they ask themselves why they hold certain beliefs and question their validity. \n\nModesty advocates are often trying to force their preferences on others. Be them be religious preachers or individual men.

Always downvoting everything that doesn't make their balls tingle. Always trash talking posters without giving any rebuttal or reason. Just insulting for little to no reason. In fact sure some redditors are gonna do the same for me in this post. The anonymity allows for anything to call me slurs or dumb motherfucker and nothing happens to them.\n\n2. Posting. There are usually SO MANY rules you have to keep in mind when posting. I.e. responding to your post like 10 times in order to actually post, or following every single one of those stupid rules, or having enough karma in the first place. It's difficult for people with no karma to do anything at all. And you know with how no life reddit mods are so they are going to find a way to ban you\/remove your post.\n\n3. I'll make a short point about this because everybody seems to disagree with me about this, but porn. NSFW results always come up even though I have not joined any NSFW subs.

Let\u2019s remember that Trump\u2019s 2016 win was a fluke due to voter apathy, rejection of Hillary, and of course, the electoral college doing its thing. 2020, Trump was defeated as the incumbent. That\u2019s especially notable because Trump performed better in 2020 than he did in 2016, and yet he still lost.\n\n\nIt can happen again, but we have to be resilient and most importantly, United. Trump continues to double down on extremist right wing policy and rhetoric. He\u2019s not earnestly trying to win over moderates and independents. That\u2019s a huge weakness for him. \n\nEven so, the race is more or less a dead heat in my eyes, but it\u2019s important to understand Trump is not invincible. His win is not inevitable; in fact very few presidents have ever won an election again after losing as an incumbent previously.

Who is the \"man under cover\", with \"a face of a lover\", \"with a fire in his heart\"? The protagonist addresses \"you\", the passionate man he fell in love with last year, who not only dropped his cover to be with him, but the very next day put up the cover again, to remain under cover, thus breaking our protagonists heart. \"I\" now knows that the Lover is a deceiver, ice cold, untrue to himself and his sexuality. So this year, or maybe next year, \"I\" won't make the same mistake and instead give his heart to a real love, someone special, someone who takes him as he is, openly gay.  \n___  \nDuh, I mean... but:  \nWe hear of four main characters in this story:  \n1. There is \"I\", the protagonist of the song and lyrical self, we can presume he is a he, because of the voice we hear referring to themselves as \"I\", George Michael.  \n2. Next there is \"you\", the mysterious other person the song is dedicated to; a gender is never mentioned. We can presume that many people who have heard the song would think that \"you\" is a woman, since that's what we see in the music video and due to heteronormativity. However, a song can always stand on its own during lyrical analysis without looking at the corresponding music video; we're handling this as a lyrical work. Therefore, we don't know the gender of \"you\", but let's look at the other characters in order to infer it.  \n3. \"But the very next day, you gave it away\", indicates a third person. \"I\" have his heart (metaphorically) to \"you\", which here should mean that \"I\" confessed his love to \"you\", but the love wasn't reciprocated and instead given away, the very next day to this third person, who we also don't know anything about.  \n4. \"This year [...] I'll give it to someone special\", finally indicated the fourth person. Because of the heartbreak \"I\" endured last year, in an effort to avoid such a thing this year, he says he will give his heart (love) to someone else, and not just anyone else, but someone special, \"a real love\".  \nWe know that \"I\" and \"you\" are seeing each other again this year and \"I\" clearly feels some animosity towards them, but is conflicted because he still has feelings for them. In an attempt to combat these feelings, he vows to give his love to someone special; meaning someone who won't break his heart, will reciprocate the love and will help him get over the feelings he still has for \"you\".  \n  \nOver the course of the song we get to hear of two more characters. One of these is actually an unspecified group of people: \"friends with tired eyes\". However, since the room is crowded, we can presume that there are a number of people, who allow the protagonist to avoid person \"you\" for the most part of the evening. The final person we hear of is the Lover.  \n  \nThe question thus becomes: who is the Lover? First of all, we know his gender to be male, since he is referred to as a he, furthermore, as a man under cover. There are three possible candidates for the Lover:  \n1. Number one is the protagonist: He has exhibited strong love in previous verses and is now talking about a \"lover with a fire in his heart\", indicating passion. Furthermore, \"you\" is the person that \"tore me apart\" as well as \"tore him apart\". He tried to stay out of \"you[r]\" way, remaining undercover, yet, \"you\" still managed to tear him apart, despite him having \"found a real love\" and not being able to be fooled again.  \n2. The second candidate is the mysterious person \"you\" ran away with last year, the very next day. In this case we would hear the protagonist talk about the man that has stolen his chance to be with \"you\". He sees him, a passionate man that tries to remain inconspicuous, under cover, but he is there now at \"you[r]\" side, mocking our protagonist with his presence, which \"tore me apart\". The protagonist knows, however, that their union isn't going to last, since before long \"you\" will have \"tor[n] him apart\" as well.\n3. I propose a different option, that I believe is plausible: The Lover is \"you\". Looking across the room, the protagonists now speaks about the only other important figure in the narrative, he describes \"you\". \"A face\", which he couldn't resist last year, thus \"on a [previous] lover, with a fire in his heart\", able to ignite the protagonists fire, yet unaware that the soul was made of ice, a metaphor for the lack of empathy with which \"you\" had treated \"I\", when they ran away with someone else last year.  \n\"You\" acted as \"a man under cover\", which has multiple meanings: Outwardly a passionate and personable man our protagonist connected with on a platonic level at first, turned out to be covertly interested in him romantically. This lead to him and the man, being literally \"under covers\" as in in bed together. For fear of ostracisation, however, the very next day he disappeared with someone else, perhaps a woman, therefore going back under cover and inadvertently tearing our protagonist apart.  \nFurther evidence for this interpretation is that the other main character of the same sentence is \"you\". \"You\", the Lover seduced \"me\", but broke his heart. \"Now I've found a real love, You'll never fool me again\".  \nThe second time around \"I\" reiterates: \"A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)\", describing the heart with the fire as \"you[r]\" heart and reminding him that he gave him his heart. This time, also, \"you\" tore apart \"him\", the Lover, meaning that \"you\", the true character of the second person, has shattered the illusion of the Lover with his behaviour last year.  \n  \nFinally, the protagonist, now aware that the Lover of last year, who he was so in love with, is the ice-cold deceiver \"you\", who has broken his heart, has to remind himself that he should give his heart away to someone special, someone deserving of his love, who takes him as he is, a real love, not just a fling with a closeted gay man. However, this year it is already too late, since he has given the Lover so much thought again, the real love he has supposedly already found was just a lie in hopes that he could make \"you\" jealous if asked about it, an imaginary figure true enough to take \"my\" mind off of \"you\", who \"I\" still has feelings for, but alas, he wrote an entire song about him; \"Maybe next year I'll give it to someone [...] special\".","title":"The Protagonist of the Song \"Last Christmas\", by Wham has always been gay.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/ztn8os\/the_protagonist_of_the_song_last_christmas_by\/"}

So I'll get the most obvious thing out the way... Yes social media is messed up. Ofcourse it has its good sides but the sheer desperation of individuals trying to be famous online is insane. What's just as insane is the legitimacy that WE the everyday person grants these fame hungry fakers. Shallow influencers aside what about these horrible horrible tik tok challenges that literally has women objectifying their own bodies.  I feel like I can rant on about social media but most people here are probably clued on enough to know about it's shortcomings so I'll leave it be.\n\nAnother example of society and its moral bankruptcy is it's view of relationships. So no I'm not religious nor am I from a conservative country but man seeing how cheap relationships are made to be these days blows my mind. Now it's just a norm that you'll go on an app and join the proverbial meat market. It's also a given now that both guys and girls are entertaining multiple partners these days as they scramble to fill some sort of void or insecurity within themselves whilst distracting themselves with the attention they get from other people.  It's such a cheap way of meeting someone. Dating apps aside, what's with people keeping friends with exes? Why stay with someone who you either broke up with or who broke up with you. Why be friends with someone who literally let you down or you let down when it mattered most? \n\nAnother thing which I feel is a sign of society's moral decay is it's obsession with trends and celebs. Why are we so godamn obsessed with people we don't even know whilst we blindly follow whatever is trending. Are our lives that empty that we have to live vicariously through people we don't even know?! \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is how the world by in large doesn't actually care about a whole lot. Take the BLM movement, remember it trending and remember seeing so many of our friends suddenly become race relations experts? Well what I ask is, where are they now? They obviously don't care anymore because it's not trendy or popular to be speaking about it. Even though much of the issues BLM argued for still exist. Even the Ukraine conflict, remember all the stand with Ukraine posts Initially when it was trendy? Where are they now? Because Ukraine is still being attacked, do we suddenly not care anymore? Most of us never cared we only did it to show off... How disgusting.  It's the same reason why people by in large don't care about the Israel Palestine stuff unless they're either Jewish or Muslim or have some sort of vested interest or sadly hate towards eachother. There's tragedies happening all over the world which require very urgent attention but for some reason people by and large only care about what's trendy to care about. \n\n\nOur society is so godamn fake, not just on a superficial level but on a deeper level. We say we're open minded and value free speech yet cancel opinions we don't agree with and label them using some sort of buzz word to cancel debate. We claim to be understanding and we claim to value personality and intellect over looks yet ask any average or below average guy or girl how much success they have on tinder.  We say we value indvidiualsim and how we should all be ourselves yet base life of off what we see others doing. In this in age almost every view is just a regurgitated talking point rather than a view we actually did research on and came to based on our thoughts and experiences.\n\n\nWe are a fake society who's seemingly only obsessed with looking the part rather than being the part. No one seems to actually care about eachother but so long as they can look like they care then they're happy. No one seems to actually value indvidiualsim because everything they do is based of off what they see online, what their friends are doing or what their so called clique should typically be doing. It's a dog eat dog world? Nah it's a dog pretend to be cat world. No one seems to actually believe in what they stand for. \n\nThe world is cheap and morally bankrupt.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT- To everyone calling me old or saying i don't go outside or that I'm hateful or even racist.... As I've stated on this posts comments. I'm 26 university educated and Asian  living in the UK.  It's very rich those attacking this post by attacking me are accusing me of being on the internet but you are the ones acting like entitled and rude individuals by hurling personal attacks something which people usually only do online. It's you that needs to go out and spend less time on the internet so you can perhaps learn some manners. \n\nI posted this as a discussion point. I didn't post to attack anyone, if I'm wrong then politely state your case and let's have a rational discussion because it I'm wrong then I'd love to be corrected. I'm not here to be right and force people to agree with me, I'm here to learn and have a discussion with individuals all over the world. The internet has bad and good uses, I thought I'd try to make a good use of it because my friends say I often get carried away with politics, social issues and religion so I've made this account to just rant about stuff and see different perspectives to mines.

I wanted to cling to the belief that the United States was a \"work in progress\" nation: Flawed, but always striving to be a better version of itself. I wanted to believe that its loud contradictions masked a deeper yearning for justice, inclusion, and progress. I wanted to believe that Trump 1.0 was a one-off misstep. But for me, the re-election of Donald Trump, despite all the damage he did to the country and the world, has forced a reckoning: This country is not on the verge of being a better version of itself. This *is* what it is, and the rest of the world is taking note of that.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s return to power, and even having won the popular vote this time around (Making it a cultural declaration), the illusion that the US is merely undergoing growing pains is now broken. A nation that once claimed to lead the free world has, instead, affirmed values that other countries can no longer dismiss as outliers or extremes: Hatred, greed, selfishness, violence, and division. They are not aberrations, but rather the blueprint. Donald Trump (And far too many Americans themselves) is the reflection of that. It tells me that these values are not only tolerated but celebrated.\n\nAnd so, I have written off the idea that the US will ever become the nation many of us once hoped for. It will never adopt strong gun laws, no matter how many lives are lost in schools, supermarkets, or churches. It will never embrace universal healthcare, even as medical debt drowns families. It will never modernize its centuries-old Constitution to reflect on the workings of the present day, nor will it update its labor laws, democratic and voting systems, or protections for the vulnerable. These are not mere policy failures. They are repeated choices that Americans made, and they'll be poorer for it in more ways than one.\n\nMeanwhile, so many other countries (Both older and younger) have managed to do what the US will never do: They have built healthcare systems that don\u2019t bankrupt citizens. They\u2019ve reformed labor laws to reflect modern realities. They\u2019ve disarmed their societies, reimagined governance, and faced their darkest histories head-on, making them the \\*actually\\* great nations they are today.\n\nThere was a time when I believed America\u2019s vast resources, cultural influence, and innovative spirit could eventually be harnessed for good. But now, that era is gone for good. What remains is a country trapped in a feedback loop of its own dysfunction: One where the cruelty is not incidental, but central to its identity. More similar to Russia than an actual Democratic and free country. Let's face it: America will never change, because it does not want to. And that, more than any one leader or election, is the hardest truth I think we have to accept. Anyone who wishes not to live like this would be better off seeking life elsewhere.\n\nSigned, a permanently-disgraced American.","title":"What the re-election of Donald Trump says to me about America.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1kthqta\/what_the_reelection_of_donald_trump_says_to_me\/"}

I am 45% Naitve, but grew up around people from the \"rez\". I got into an argument with my history teacher over this topic, he thinks we should \"move forward and become more modern\" when approaching this topic. So here we are. \n\nHere is all of the treaties broken by the US Government: Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851), Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), Indian Removal Act (1830), and Trail of Tears Treaty of New Echota (1835), Fort Atkinson Treaty (1853), Treaty of Medicine Lodge (1867), Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768), Dawes Act (1887), Black Hills Conflict (1877), Nez Perce War (1877), Treaty of 1863 (Navajo), Treaty of Fort Hill (1794), Sand Creek Massacre (1864), Wounded Knee Massacre (1890). According to NPR, the United States has broken more than 370 ratified treaties with Native American nations. If we count all the \"promises\" that many signed to save their people, I am sure there are more that have been hushed away.\n\nI am a grandkid to a wonderful woman who had to face the atrocities that the US Government put in place when it came to boarding schools. My great great great great uncle fought in the battle of wounded knee and was killed. He was only a young man. I have seen the reservations that ee have been tied down to, which we could leave but that costs so much more than we are given. Many of my relatives are \"stuck\" because that is what they know as home. Families have grown there. You can't just pick up and leave.\n\nWhere I am located, we face harsh criticism and racism. I'm just saying, why don't we all look around once in a while and see what you took from us. When will we have justice? When will we be given back what was ours? How many treated has the US broke? Oh yeah, all of them.\n\nIt's a personal thing for many of us. I remember glossing over many of those treaties in my elementary-middle school, primarily highlighting the drug, alcohol, and obesity issues with Native Americans today. I felt ashamed. I still do. It wasn't until I was a freshman in highschool and I had to CHOOSE to take a class over my history to learn the real story. All of it. Personally, I am amazed that my teacher could fit in as much as she did in a single semester. She even said that this should be REQUIRED for Americans to learn of that side of history just like how you had to learn about the founding fathers.\n\nIt really hits me hard when I see other kids and even adults choose not to embrace nor even tell others they are Native American out of shame. We need to fix this. Let's start where we should've almost 250 years ago. Lets make a change.","title":"Native Americans have every right to be pissed off.

More knowledge of the self is not a bad thing. And even when knowledge can be destructive in the wrong hands, eventually someone is going to figure it out and it's probably better that those people be genuine seekers of deeper truth, rather than people who only want to exploit what they've learned.  \nHowever, 99% of the time in the US social discourse, questions like \"What is a woman?\" and \"Why do some people identify as non-binary?\" are not posed in the pursuit of enlightenment, but to be wielded as a hammer against a vulnerable community.   \nIn Florida, if I got stabbed a doctor could choose to let me bleed out on the table because they're allowed to deny me medical care.* I can get fired for being trans. I have to forcibly out myself in dangerous situations by using the bathroom for my sex assigned at birth. I can lose my apartment for being trans. The attorney general of Texas has literally been putting together a list of names of trans people. Books that just say \"hey, some people are trans and that's okay\" are being ripped off the shelves of libraries.  \nBut when those concerns are raised, people spend time just questioning whether we exist at all, or wondering why people would want pronouns listed in their bio. The real oppression our community faces is being swept under the rug with whataboutism and fear mongering.  \nI sincerely hope that one day we will be developed enough as a society to explore the causes of gender dysphoria and the way we perceive ourselves. But right now, we're not there yet.\n\n*Edit: Some commenters have noted that that's not technically what the current law in Florida means, but I have heard multiple interpretations at this point and will need to do more research to clarify. That said, there is a law on the books in Florida allowing doctors to refuse medically necessary treatment for trans people on the basis of their personal beliefs.","title":"The noble pursuit of the etiology of trans identity has been weaponized against people who mostly want to be in public and hold down jobs.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/18pvu30\/the_noble_pursuit_of_the_etiology_of_trans\/"}

I have never seen someone on that sub get downvoted to hell for defending Trump, but it's happening. I don\u2019t know how much will change from this in the base, but there is already a clear split between those who aren't concerned if Trump was knowing and involved in child trafficking, and those who are holding on to their strong values and demanding transparency, like he promised.\n\nIt's really refreshing to not see the most extreme views packed into one post, but instead people genuinely asking what the hell is going on.\n\nMe, myself, I am trapped in my own liberal bubble on the internet, because that's just what social media does.\nThe people at the top are relying on us thinking that the people on the other side are unreasonable and morally corrupt.

In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon.\u201d\n\nWhat ideas? Like Vance, Roberts is obsessed with the idea that the left controls major American institutions \u2014 he lists Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education and even the Boy Scouts of America. The book argues that \u201cconservatives need to burn down\u201d these institutions if \u201cwe\u2019re to preserve the American way of life.\u201d (Vox has requested a copy of the book, but has not yet received one at the time of this writing.)\n\nObviously, this poses a problem for Trump\u2019s attempts to distance himself from the virally unpopular Project 2025 and its lengthy agenda for what he should do if he wins, which includes proposals to restrict abortion access and centralize executive power in the presidency.\"\n\nTime to face it: Project 2025 is Trump's plan.

Skepticism aside, this is a very important event that can drastically change the political situation in the largest country in the world.\n\nAt first glance, it seems that the choice of parties is huge - there are 14, but even the Russians themselves don't know much about most of them. The largest parties like the Liberal Democratic Party and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation have been almost completely controlled by Putin for a long time. It seems that the largest real opposition force in Russia is the democratic party Yabloko. [Experts](https:\/\/euobserver.com\/opinion\/152752) also note the party's ability to change the situation in the country. \n\nA few years ago, Navalny proposed his solution on how to defeat Putin and the United Russia party in the elections. He and his team have created the Smart Voting service - a special system that aims to coordinate people, offering them to vote for the opposition candidates. The purpose of this system is to prevent the Putin's party from obtaining the majority of votes by joining efforts (here is a recent post about it - \u0441\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430).\n\nThe system works as follows: you visit the website, indicate your address, and get a recommended candidate or a party for you to vote for (by the way, these candidates are being selected by Navalny's team). The paradox is that in former elections, most of the recommended candidates belonged to the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Liberal Democratic Party. These parties pretend to form the opposition, although for many years, they have sided with Putin and his associates. Meanwhile, the service almost never recommends the Yabloko party. That\u2019s weird as Yabloko was the only party that has officially opposed Navalny's arrest and always supported him.\n\nThe fact is that the opposition, Putin's opponents, and Russians who are simply eager for changes have only two options \u2013 completely ignore the elections to the State Duma,or vote for Yabloko that seems to be the only truly democratic party.\n\nIs there anyone from Russia? Share in comments, please, whom are you going to vote for?\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not from Russia, how would you act in this political situation?","title":"Whom Russians will elect to the State Duma","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/pjx5ua\/whom_russians_will_elect_to_the_state_duma\/"}

Why can he do this? Because he passed an executive order saying he can. Literally Ron Swanson tier writing a note that says \"I can ignore the constitution\" and the US supreme court is now saying, we go with the note he's holding over the constitution until they get around to ruling on it.

I know this is long. Please Read it anyway. You need to. Because what\u2019s coming? It\u2019s not good.**\n\nI literally timed myself reading this Because I care so much. I have ADHD and am a poor reader. It took 7 Minutes. I honestly bet you could do better.\n\nWithout sounding like a commercial, these 7 minutes could potentially save you a lot of pain in the near future.\n\n---\n\nBefore we start, let me explain my credentials and my limits. I earned a Bachelor's in Economics, focusing on heterodox theory, Neoclassical Economics, and Asian-Economics. Multiple of my Macro-Economic classes covered different economic crisis scenarios including stagflation. In total across my different classes id estimate I spent about a full year studying these scenarios and the mathematics behind them. I also have taken several courses in Human behavior, History, Psychology, and Business Management to supplement my degree. I'm by no means a PHD, but I'm a lot more familiar with this than some rando.\n\nEven so, *I never studied for what\u2019s happening now.* Not because I missed something, but because no one thought anyone would actually be stupid enough to try this. In class, we\u2019d throw out \u201cfun\u201d hypotheticals like: \u201cWhat if we had high inflation *and* a deep recession? How do you fix that?\u201d and professors would laugh \u2014 because that\u2019s game over. That\u2019s like asking a doctor how to treat a skeleton. \u201cIdk, ask a necromancer.\u201d\n\nThis was always supposed to be a theoretical edge-case. But I know enough to see the warning signs. And they\u2019re bad.\n\n---\n\nLet me establish a couple things to help you understand the situation if you're unfamiliar with macro-economics.\n\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. If you\u2019re a company importing corn at $1,000 per ton, and there\u2019s a 35% tariff slapped on it, you now pay $1,350 per ton. That\u2019s just how tariffs work.\n\nNow here\u2019s the thing: companies are legally obligated to prioritize shareholder profits. That means if costs go up, *they have to* pass them to consumers \u2014 or risk getting sued. So:\n\n- Tariffs \u2192 Higher costs \u2192 Higher prices \u2192 Inflation.\n\nThe U.S. was already seeing moderate inflation due to COVID-related supply chain shocks. The rest of the world? Already worse off. But that\u2019s about to change.\n\nWe are now introducing tariffs across the board, on top of an already weakened and fragile system. At the same time, we're showing multiple quarters of economic contraction \u2014 strong signs of a looming recession.\n\nNormally, high inflation + stagnant growth = stagflation. That alone is catastrophic.\n\nBut what we\u2019re doing now is different. We\u2019re heading into *high inflation plus active, deep recession.* That\u2019s not stagflation. That\u2019s... I don\u2019t even have a word for it. And that\u2019s the point.\n\nThis situation is so extreme that it wasn\u2019t considered worth covering in much detail. It would render most of what you learn in an economics degree pointless. There's no clean playbook for this. Just like there\u2019s no emergency protocol in case of full-scale nuclear exchange \u2014 once you're there, the protocol is \u201cgood luck.\u201d\n\n---\n\nSo how bad could this get?\n\nHere are a few historical parallels, keeping in mind that *none* of them involved an economy anywhere near the size or complexity of the U.S.:\n\n- **Zimbabwe (2000s):** GDP dropped more than 50%. Hyperinflation hit 89.7 *sextillion* percent. They had to abandon their own currency and adopt the U.S. dollar. They\u2019re still struggling today and may be heading for round two.\n  \n- **Venezuela (2014\u2013present):** GDP collapse of 75%+. Inflation peaked at over 1,000,000%. No end in sight.\n  \n- **Weimar Germany (1921\u20131923):** Hyperinflation so bad people bought bread with wheelbarrows of cash. The government collapsed, and within a decade, Hitler was in power. The economy didn\u2019t truly stabilize until *massive* U.S. intervention \u2014 and no one is big enough to \u201cbail out\u201d the U.S.\n\nNow, the U.S. is not Zimbabwe. We have a much larger, more diversified economy. But that doesn\u2019t make us immune \u2014 it makes us *slower to adapt*. When a big economy goes down, it goes down harder. It\u2019s like a cargo ship \u2014 takes a long time to turn, and if you hit the reef, it tears the whole thing open.\n\nMost economic downturns unfold over 2\u20134 years. Companies adjust, restructure, plan around it. What we\u2019re seeing now is *weeks* of volatility that would normally be spread across years. That\u2019s terrifying.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a red flag. It\u2019s the entire Mongol horde cresting the hill, waving crimson banners.\n\n---\n\nHere\u2019s the other problem: even if Trump walks this back in a few months, the damage may already be locked in. The world has no reason to return to pre-tariff trade terms. Trust has been shattered.\n\nTrump is pulling a \u201cI\u2019ve altered the deal \u2014 pray I don\u2019t alter it further.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world is saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve moved on.\u201d\n\nI grew up in China. It\u2019s surreal seeing China, Korea, and Japan collaborating right now. These are countries with centuries of tension, distrust, and sometimes outright hatred. And now they\u2019re working together. Because forging a new future *without* the U.S. is starting to look better than dealing with us at all.\n\nThat\u2019s what should terrify you.\n\nThe U.S. spent 80 years making sure *this* exact outcome wouldn\u2019t happen \u2014 that the Pacific powers wouldn\u2019t unite without us. But here we are.\n\n---\n\nAnd nothing so far indicates Trump plans to back down. The longer this goes on, the closer we get to stagflation \u2014 or worse. Think of stagflation like a bomb. Once you light the fuse, you don\u2019t get to \u201cpause\u201d it. You either defuse it *fast* or it goes off, and your only option becomes rebuilding from rubble.\n\nIn most \u201cworst-case\u201d textbook scenarios, you deal with:\n\n- High inflation  \n- Stagnant or mildly contracting economy\n\nWhat we\u2019re facing now is:\n\n- High inflation  \n- Severe contraction  \n- Mass unemployment\n\nAnd what do you do in that scenario?\n\nHere\u2019s the brutal catch-22:\n\n- You can\u2019t stimulate the economy (monetary or fiscal) without worsening inflation.  \n- You can\u2019t raise interest rates to fight inflation without deepening the recession.  \n- You can\u2019t implement effective supply-side reform fast enough to relieve pressure \u2014 those take years or decades.\n\nIt\u2019s an economic death spiral. We don\u2019t have the usual tools anymore. We\u2019d need perfect cooperation, stability, and long-term planning \u2014 and we don\u2019t have any of that.\n\n---\n\n**TLDR: It\u2019s very fucking bad.** We barely covered this in school because it was considered too ridiculous to ever happen. But it\u2019s happening.\n\nStart preparing.\n\n- Stock up on non-perishables.  \n- Freeze what you can.  \n- Plant a garden.  \n- Talk to your family \u2014 especially if they have land.  \n- If you\u2019re in a city, start container gardening or build community plans.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just \u201ctighten your belt\u201d bad. This is \u201c$200 for eggs while your income flatlines\u201d bad.\n\nAnd yeah, America has farms \u2014 but unless you think Cargill, ADM, and Bunge are handing out food for free, I wouldn\u2019t count on them. And that\u2019s *if* they can get the fertilizer and parts they need. Much of our ag supply chain is *also* global.\n\nIf you want tomatoes next year that don\u2019t cost $50 each, *plant them now*.\n\n---\n*Rays of Sunshine: Some hope*\n\nAs far as I can surmise our only hope to avoid a very very bad outcome is that Trump reverses the tariffs immediately \u2014 Before stagflation is fully triggered \u2014 and hope global response is forgiving.\n\nBut as we've\nAs we\u2019ve spent years under Trump telling the rest of the world:  \n\ud83d\udd95(-_-)\ud83d\udd95 \u201cGo fuck yourselves.\u201d\nWe will likely have some begging and expensive heavy apologizing to do. But we can survive that.\n\nAnd if we're very lucky and we only have a moderate recession and the tariffs don't set off a full trade war and instead only cause a moderate increase to our existing moderate inflation. Then we'll only have a baby economic crisis and maybe a case of Stagflation-lite (on the precipice of the real deal). And maybe in that scenario under very competent leadership and economic management (though I dont really know of anyone truly qualified to navigate such uncharted waters) we could be steered away from the cliff and back to economic stability.\n\n\n_____\n\np.s.: Sry for the edits.

Instead, \"all of the news organizations in this case took a deep breath and paused, and thought about who was likely to be leaking the documents, what the motives of the hacker might have been, and whether this was truly newsworthy or not.\"\n\nThe media also falls over themselves to sanitize the MAGA weirdos rhetoric into something less harmful - the media barely touches the fat that conservatives wave \"Mass deportations now\" signs at rallies, lie constantly about Democrats' positions on abortion, promise to monitor children's periods\/fertility, and Trump himself can barely remember what day it is anymore. \n\nMeanwhile, the same media can't stop screaming that Democrats have to appeal to a \"center\" that does not exist and try to convince anyone that incredibly moderate democrat Tim Walz is an extremist (https:\/\/www.the-reframe.com\/what-center-is-that-exactly\/)\n\nSo, how do people pretend that the media is biased against conservatives when it gives them every benefit of the doubt and frequently takes their obvious lies at face value? \n\nIf American conservatives were intellectually honest, wouldn't this undermine their claims that The Elite are against them?\n\nIsn't it farcical to believe that a billionaire who inherited everything and his ivy league vice president whose Senate seat was purchased for $15 million by a DIFFERENT billionaire are \"fighting the elites\" to begin with?","title":"How do people pretend the media is biased AGAINST conservatives?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1erhd0i\/how_do_people_pretend_the_media_is_biased_against\/"}

All week I\u2019ve been struggling with taking care of myself again. I was doing so well for so long. I literally hadn\u2019t had any suicidal ideations for over a year and then the night Trump was elected I couldn\u2019t stop crying and had to take off of work for a week, because I was so distraught and terrified about what that meant for me as a trans person. Now, not even a week into it, and he\u2019s taken away my rights and is aiming for my chances of ever getting out of poverty or getting healthy. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening right now is so beyond terrifying and triggering to a maximum and I can\u2019t understand why people are acting like everything is fine. I relapsed and can\u2019t stop drinking. I spend most of my day in bed when I\u2019m not at work or dissociating or both. It feels like when I was trapped in my mother\u2019s house. No way out. No hope for anyone coming to save me. I was a prisoner to her abuse. I feel like a prisoner to Trump\u2019s abuse. I feel like a prisoner inside the country I was born in, because I happened to not be born white or cisgender. \n\nI spent the past ten years of my life rebuilding my mental state after my childhood. I finally reach a good point where I\u2019m on medication that works well for me, I can finally work again, I can talk to people and not be in a constant emotional flashback. Now it\u2019s all gone down the drain. I don\u2019t have the energy to do this. I don\u2019t think I can survive another Trump presidency. At least the last time I hadn\u2019t realized anything about myself and was still presenting as my agab. Now I pass as my chosen gender but what happens when they try to ban my medication? What happens when they don\u2019t just want to get rid of migrants and they want to get rid of us too? What happens when a cop takes one look at me,  sees that I look hispanic even though I\u2019m not, profiles me and deports me to a country I\u2019ve never belonged to? \n\nI\u2019m terrified and the amount of gaslighting coming from bots and magas has been the most triggering of all.  I am diagnosed with ptsd and major depression and have been told by a long term trauma therapist that I have complex ptsd. I experienced a horrific childhood growing up to a single, schizoaffective mother in the projects in the US. How I was treated when I tried to speak up and advocate for myself feels terrifyingly similar to when I speak out against what\u2019s happening in the country right now with the Trump admin. Just like being told that my mother was a good mother and didn\u2019t mean to hurt me and I should forgive her because she did it because she cared. Just like being told to suck it up and I\u2019m a crybaby and a snowflake and too soft and mocking me by saying awww boohoo and shit, because I dared to express my authentic feelings about *literal abuse* and a lot of them were fear and sadness. Just being viciously and baselessly invalidated and gaslit for daring to speak up against the regime. \n\nI don\u2019t want to belong to a country where asking for accountability is met with mocking. I don\u2019t want to live in a country where victims are metaphorically pummeled from all sides until they\u2019re dead. But I can\u2019t leave, I looked into it. I have friends in both the UK and Canada who would take me in, but now the executive order about the federal gov not recognizing legal gender changes means I can\u2019t get a passport that reflects my new legal gender, and if I try I will be drawing attention to myself as a trans person, because I have a very masculine legal name that does not in anyway read female, while looking straight up like a man. I would be found out immediately. \n\nAnd even if I could get my passport, I would still need the money to move, and to obtain a visa in a different country, which is extremely difficult to do. For all the people who love to scream \u201cjust leave if you don\u2019t like it\u201d - yeah I would LOVE to, but most countries don\u2019t want random ass immigrants in their country without that person having a lot to offer them. \n\nI just feel at a maximum anxiety every single day and haven\u2019t been able to get out of a cycle of smoking and drinking just so I don\u2019t have to feel so devastated and angry and scared every second. I am still trying to force myself to exercise and eat and drink water but I\u2019ve only managed to exercise once this week, and I still have schoolwork I have to get done and now I don\u2019t even know if my federal loans and grants that I depend heavily on are going on the chopping block, and I didn\u2019t get paid enough to be able to pay my health insurance for the 2nd month in a row and I\u2019m fucking trying so fucking hard. What\u2019s even the fucking point? I might as well just put myself out of my own misery.

The Confederacy was an extreme right wing take on governing and here we are today dealing with their inability to do much more than suck off the wealth of the Union. \n\nTo the Confederates out there swearing the South will rise again, the South has had over a hundred years to turn the southern states into a group of states who are successful but can't seem to do so without slavery even with automation the way it is. That's pathetic. Over a hundred years and y'all still can't govern.\n\n\n\n**In Congress, July 4, 1776**\n\n**The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,**\u00a0When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.","title":"The Founding Fathers of the US would have gone to war against Trump and the current Republican party.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1k07m4o\/the_founding_fathers_of_the_us_would_have_gone_to\/"}

I know you're all dying to hear what somebody like me has to say, for a change. \n\nI consider myself lucky. I'm not rich by any means, but I have enough money to live my life very comfortably. I haven't had to worry about money in probably 10 years. I've got a good job at a great company that's growing at a rate of $5 billion a year. I have a vintage Porsche in the garage. I feel good about who I am and who I'm becoming in middle age. I'm  proud of what I've accomplished on my own, and I'm also grateful to the people who gave me a boost along the way. I didn't start at the bottom of the mountain, I get that. I'm lucky. \n\nHaving said that, I'm raising two kids and two dogs and a parrot and six tropical fish, and I got two elderly moms with health problems who I have to look after, and my job, and a lazy fat wife who lays around criticizing but never does shit herself, and sometimes it feels like I'm holding the whole fucking world together, and honestly, I'm just getting a little tired of everybody else's drama and bullshit.\n\nSo here's what I want from the world. You can call this political or whatever, I guess that's what it is but these are a few very simple things that would help my life and the people I love.\n\n1. Legal weed. I figure I don't have to explain this, but just in case you haven't been living on planet Earth, people have been using weed safely for literally thousands of years. It improves your mood. It makes you feel better. It takes all your little aches and pains away and it helps you forget your stresses for a couple hours so you can relax and watch a movie or something. It's a fucking plant, just like coffee. Get over it.\n\n2. Just be nice to each other. People my age and a little bit younger (Millennials, I guess) are truly as a rule very nice to each other. We don't get caught up so much in politics or anybody else's drama, because we simply have too much shit to do. \n\nThe olds, on the other hand, are always getting in some drama-fueled shit fit over some supposed deeply held moral value that they themselves don't even hold to but still parade it around, because these motherfuckers love to make a scene. Why are old people such drama queens? It's wearing me out bro. Seriously yall gotta chill. \n\nThe 20s kids are neurotic and pissy as 20 year olds have been known to be, but gotdamn, yall are especially weird right now. Me not putting my pronouns on my email is not a microaggression, dude I am trying to get your friend. I bought you Skittles in the canteen last week, we are good, don't make a thing about this.\n\nI was trying to make a point about being nice and I guess it came off as ageist and I didn't really mean for that to happen, I'm just talking about what I see and it just seems like the nicer people I'm around on a daily basis all tend to be in their 30s-40s-50s and everybody else seems on the verge of having a conniption fit at all times.\n\nSo I guess just try to be nice.\n\n3.

He noted that the former president has \u201cbeen at our organization, he\u2019s raised money for our organization, he\u2019s blessed it \u2026 he\u2019s very supportive of what we do.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t just bluster to try to land a big check, according to others in the MAGA movement. Trump and Vought have spoken at various times since leaving office, and the former president has adopted some of Vought\u2019s ideas, two sources familiar with their relationship told CNN.\n\n...\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got about 350 different documents that are regulations and things of that nature that are, we\u2019re planning for the next administration,\u201d he said.\n\nFor example, \u201cyou may say, \u2018OK, all right, DHS, we want to have the largest deportation,\u2019\u201d Vought said. \u201cWhat are your actual memos that a secretary sends out to do it?

He praised the Heritage Foundation's efforts to craft the plan, he personally chose a Heritage Foundation candidate as his vice president nominee - a person who signed off on and wrote the forward to a book that promotes Project 2025, also - and the majority of the authors of the plan were administrative staff who reported directly to Trump when he was president. \n\nIndeed, Trump *already obediently carried out* nearly all of the last Mandate for Leadership the Heritage Foundation prepared for him. The question isn't *whether* it is his plan, it is rather why would anyone who claims to be interested in liberty, egalitarianism, freedom and other enlightenment ideals continue to defend or support this Christian nationalist nonsense?","title":"Project 2025 cofounder admits Trump endorses plan in secret recording, and more.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1eszm3t\/project_2025_cofounder_admits_trump_endorses_plan\/"}

At the moment I am working on getting back to a healthy weight which for my height would be around 70kg. I've lost 3kg in the past month and am really happy about my progress.\n\nI've seen it all over the Internet a lot and it's always bugged me but I've just gone through a thread of youtube comments that made me want to bang my head into the wall until I erase my memory as its primary focus was about how \"fatphobia\" is just as bad as homophobia or racism and that he word obese should be flagged a slur just like the F and N words.\n\nI fully blame this recent wave of \"body empowerment\" for this way of thinking. Body empowerment\/positivity refers to physical defects or anomalies or being thicker whilst also healthy at the same time, or being skinny but a healthy weight. It's supposed to help marginalised people feel like they're not freaks and accept their anomalies as something positive. What it's *not* for is lazy manbabies who weigh 200kg yelling at everything about how they're being equally discriminated against as black people.\n\nObesity in 100% of cases is a result of the obese person's decisions. This is often accompanied by enabling behaviour from those close to them but when it boils down to it, it is all in the hands of the obese person. Whether or not there's underlying trauma is completely irrelevant because it's still your choice and at some point you have to choose between life and death, not between taking accountability for your actions and blaming science for deeming your weight unhealthy.\n\nThe word obese isn't just a second word for ugly or stupid, it's a word to describe someone who's very overweight and has passed the healthy limit for their age\/height and needs to start looking for ways to lower these numbers. It is not a slur, it is an adjective, an adjective that should make you think about yourself and your choices and realise that you're unhealthy - it should not be your scapegoat for feeling self conscious.\n\nMore often than not people who tell you that are obese are trying to get you to realise that you'll die young unless you change something. They're not here to hurt you or make you feel less than, they're here to snap you out of your daydream where you're a baby who can't take responsibility for their actions.\n\nStop equating obesity to slavery they literally have no correlation to each other save for the fact that the n word and obese are both words. Either make a change or die by 30, I really couldn't give a shit, but quit blaming others and quit trying to victimise yourself when the only victim here is your poor heart trying to keep your lazy ass alive.","title":"From an obese person, fatphobia isn't a thing and \"obese\" isn't a slur - get over yourself.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/hyz675\/from_an_obese_person_fatphobia_isnt_a_thing_and\/"}

I expected to see shady funds that went to Democrats because we constantly see nothing but bashing against Democrats by Elon, Trump and Republicans while defending Republicans at every single issue. \n\nAt worst, we've seen funds go to projects that was bipartisan passed through government systems with what might be some human error. The social security claim is hard to accept as honest due to Elon's history but with what he's presented, it looks less like ghost recipients and more like some kind of either error checking codes or SS income designators for businesses. \n\nWe then see Elon and Trump basically complain about Democracy, checks and balances which is by design to prevent a dictator from doing whatever they want and throw a fit about not having absolute power and control over everything. Elon walking in and calling everything criminal and stopping funds without any kind of error checking is corrupt behavior. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love fact checking, clean regulations and error checking, but Republicans are the ones firing and nulling those organizations.

But I always equate OF to twitch streaming, for every super famous multi-millionaire there are 10s of thousands of people whose only viewers are their friends and families. For every super sexy 20 something making 300k a month there are thousands of young women who made an OF out of financial desperation or in search of a short cut to pay their bills.\n\nMany young women are drawn to the marketing popularity in the same way that young men are drawn to Twitch's marketing. It's a seemingly easy way to make a lot of money doing something you already do on your spare time. But just like twitch, most people see minimal if any success before moving on to a regular job and hoping the subject doesn't come up. The only difference is that twitch streamers may be embarrassed of cringe video content while OF girls have their most intimate interactions and body parts plastered for any creepy family member or snooping coworker to find reverse image search. It does serious harm to young women who may have had a lapse of judgement in a moment of desperation.\n\nOnlyFans knows this, they have a target demographic for both models and consumers. They want to attract a plethora of young women to the platform. They want the average woman to publish content that pulls the coworker, acquittance, or classmate to the platform. People who want to see that woman naked but don't have a chance at them in real life.\n\nAs for its consumer base, my opinion remains the same as any porn in the US. Its target demographic is mostly young men ages 12-28 who have no self control of their consumption rate. There's a reason its so easy to access these websites but that's another discussion entirely.\n\nFinally, its harmful to society as a whole because it took the rather small scale harm porn had on women who produced it and marketed it to every young woman who had a phone. It normalized the production of pornographic content. Where porn previously targeted nearly all men and women indirectly, it now reached out to every woman of voting age.\n\nI know this is going to be a very unpopular opinion on Reddit specifically and the common argument is \"Well that's a society problem\" but the harm it does to these women is severe and can't be understated. You can't change that by screaming about how employers and men need to be accepting and women shouldn't feel ashamed. But you can change it by acknowledging that OF directly markets to desperate young women and destroys many lives and relationships to make its financial goals. It's digital prostitution.","title":"OnlyFans is a predatory business which is objectively harmful to society","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1arlt1x\/onlyfans_is_a_predatory_business_which_is\/"}

Before each presidential elections in the USA, there is something called midterms. And when are the next midterms you say? In 2026. If you want to stop Trump from doing more egregious things before the 2028 elections, you need to vote blue in the 2026 midterms. Sure, the majority the GOP has in Congress is too small to allow some things to pass (like ending birthright citizenship, which also requires the approval of 38 states), but a red victory in the 2026 midterms will make that majority bigger. If you really want to stop Trump, you need to make that majority smaller or even eliminate it entirely. And to do this, you need to vote blue in 2026.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about Democrat or Republican.

My views are solidly moderate and I live in a western state that, while increasingly liberalized, is still solidly red due to severe gerrymandering. I apologize in advance that the post is long and rambling at times. \n\nEspecially over the past handful of weeks I have been developing a deep seated sense of intense dread that I cannot shake. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not still trying to live my best life and make daily progress, but this feeling is unlike any other I\u2019ve ever experienced. What\u2019s even more concerning, to me, is the fact that my gut feelings are rarely ever wrong. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m looking at a storm on the horizon. The darkest, most ominous storm I have ever seen. Clouds so thick they blacken the sky and the only light that escapes are from the jagged bolts of lighting that rip the clouds asunder with world shattering booms. I'm watching them, feeling the wind blowing but can\u2019t quite tell the direction. The wind is too wild and the clouds too obscuring to tell if it will all just blow harmlessly by, graze us, or hit head on. \n\nHistory is cyclical. Things go from bad to good, then good to bad, so on and so on. There\u2019s always bad stuff going on somewhere in the world. And there\u2019s always been stressors to every generation the same way people have always said, \u201cthis election is the worst I\u2019m just voting for the lesser of two evils\u201d.\n\nThings are hitting differently to me right now though. It seems like sometime around the beginning of Covid, this coaster completely jumped the tracks straight onto the pages of one of the bleakest dystopian future novels. \n\nI remember reading popular science as a kid with cover photos imagining the future looking something like Back to the Future 2 and feeling that sometimes as a civilization we may take a step back but overall it\u2019s persistent forward progress. The last four years have completely obliterated that optimism. Here we are in 2024 dealing with the same old problems of racism, prejudice, religious fanaticism, and inequality along with a whole host of new problems people a hundred years ago could never have imagined.\n\nThe existential threats have multiplied exponentially over the last century. It seems ever more likely that the answer to Fermi\u2019s Paradox is the Great Filter. But aside from the standard possibilities like asteroids and super volcanos which have always felt benign, now we have nuclear technology, global warming, AI, renewed religious fanaticism, inequality\/societal collapse, etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think humanity as a species is likely of going anywhere anytime soon. Given most of the scenarios listed above, we would persist as a species, but as an individual it feels like we're standing on the shore feeling the outgoing surf erode and pull the sand out from under our feet. \n\nNuclear Technology - this isn\u2019t a new problem, but its proliferation is. We are also dealing with major religious sects whose extremists may soon get their hands on it. People that don\u2019t have the same traditional fear of death, but rather celebrate it in the service of their god. Those are the last kind of people I\u2019d ever feel comfortable having their hands on this technology. Added in increasing population and dwindling resources, and the literal powder keg grows.\n\nGlobal warming - the signs are everywhere. And it\u2019s more than just the warming itself, it\u2019s the general systematic erosion of environmental integrity. Coral bleaching, microplastics in every nook and cranny we look, pollution, deforestation and mining. Yet somehow we have folks in denial saying things like, \u201cbut the skiing this year was the best in my whole life!\u201d. As if all the scientists, people who have dedicated their lives and careers to the pursuit of knowledge, somehow are all in on some global conspiracy. It's evident everywhere, higher global temperatures, intensified and more frequent hazardous weather events, decreasing glacial packs, rising sea levels. On personal, first hand observations alone we can vouch for the declines in our lifetimes of insects and birds. It\u2019s ludicrous to me to think that on the micro level we could make a damn, or cut down a forest completely altering those ecosystems but that at the macro level 8 billion of us somehow are incapable of effecting the planet at large. This is only escalated by unchecked capitalism, where the prime directive is to always increase profits and lower the bottom line, people and environment be damned. It's a race to the bottom for our species.\n\nAI - it\u2019s everywhere, half the internet content I\u2019m seeing from comments, to photos to articles are all AI generated. A lot of people can\u2019t even tell the difference. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell the difference, that alone is one problem. Worse yet and similar to nuclear technology, if an AI ever goes rogue, all it takes is one bad actor plugging it into the internet and we\u2019re toast. It ultimately doesn\u2019t really matter if the AI is truly sentient or not. Its not hard to fathom that an AI might have either a logical or sentient emotional response with a species like ourselves that despite our many strengths, are so ingrained with the weaknesses and inefficiencies listed here. \n\nReligious fanaticism - the year is 2024 but despite mountains of evidence and data, we still have folks that are more inclined to believe the fanciful tales in the Bible than the fact the earth is older than 6,000 years or that evolution exists (just look at different domestic dog breeds we\u2019ve created in the last 100 years!). I frequently find myself attempting (emphasis on attempting) to have philosophical debates on subjects like abortion with religious fanatics who regularly display they are incapable of telling the difference between an early stage fetus and a late stage baby\/human. They scream at you over and over about how you\u2019re a murderer while turning a blind eye to rapes or deaths from miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies, and an even blinder eye to the hundreds of thousands of unwanted children already in the foster system. That just sits wrong with me. So wrong. They try to defend life while requiring so much human suffering to bring it into being. I cannot rationalize that or see that as Christlike. And that\u2019s just touching on western Christianity which is the predominant religions in the US. Families are torn apart and people even killed in the name of religion and various belief systems. Time and time again we find our civilization as a whole, pressed down by this weight of religion.\n\nInequality and societal collapse - In the context of what I\u2019ll touch on here, this is more of an American concern, however any of the issues above could cause collapse at the global scale. America has been worn down from the inside with the age old divide and conquer strategy. Foreign players have openly been dividing us -  embarrassingly obviously. Left vs right, young vs old, and anywhere they can get a foothold. People even acknowledge this yet you can hop on pretty much any article and the comment section will be filled with childish left VS right insults and jokes. People write off or disown friends or even family members for their political beliefs. Meanwhile our national government has long since fallen asleep at the wheel. Corporate lobbyists are ingrained in the system. People in government shamelessly profiting off insider trading. Lots of them are so old they\u2019re completely out of touch with the needs of regular folks (assuming they'd gave a rat's ass anyway). All we hear about is how big and scary the other party is while most of these people really don\u2019t care either way and it shows. They're just out to get their piece until they kick the bucket while working joes are bent over and robbed blind in every way from taxes, to medical costs, general cost of living, inflated housing costs and on and on. The government sits by and does next to nothing which leaves it as no surprise as to why the election went the way it did. Now we have a guy who nudged a run on the capitol calling for a rout of the government. Only time will tell if it\u2019s genuine concern (unlikely), characteristic disruptive behavior, or something much, much worse. We are queued to be governed by a posse of business men with severe conflicts of interests, who have repeatedly proven they're more concerned about their businesses than their employees (or even their families). Talking about slashing the system based on socials with department names like Doge. This is as dystopian as it gets, you couldn't make this stuff up. Half the headlines look like they're from The Onion. Not that the founders of the US were flawless either but I'm very confident they wouldn't like these people. In a few generations our descendants may look back on the picture that's been going around the web of Trump and friends eating McDonalds on their jet and see it as the robber barons of today (or worse, but time will tell). In the mean time, instead of trying to make real change, it seems the same greed that drove these people and other billionaires to this level of riches now has them doubling down. Locking in a death grip their hold on all that they can and literally building bunkers instead of trying to solve the problems as if they can sense the storm that is coming as well.\n\nIt used to be a satirical joke to say I feel sorry for kids nowadays but now I really mean it. If it's bad for us, I think about the world the babies of today will inherit. It's hard for me to think about willingly  putting kids into that situation. That optimistic drive to learn, to grow, and make a good life for ourselves not just as an individual but also as a species seems to be getting extinguished before our very eyes. People are getting tired and discouraged of toiling for a future that instead of getting better, is getting bleaker with every passing day. And instead of trying to change it, the futility and hopelessness has many turned to escapism on their phones, games, etc. I'm starting to see the future as something like the Alien films, or countless other movies where the megacorps like Weyland Yutani are running the show and exploiting humans as much as legally (or illegally but not enforceable) possible because people are just seen as replaceable and expendable assets. We're already seeing the beginnings of this on a large scale as companies like Amazon replace workforce with the very robots and automation futurists used to predict would make our lives so \"easy\" so we could pursue our passions and interests. This is not the future I would hope for. Its as if every fantastical and futuristic idea to better our species has been corrupted into something malignant and self serving, sucking the life force from everyone who touches it. Medicine, social media, and online dating are just a few examples of modern solutions intended to solve problems that have been corrupted to extract as much profit as possible often aggravating the very problems they set out to resolve. It's depressing and we could be doing so much better. The solutions are so close, yet so far. We have all the tools to solve virtually all of our problems but people starve while others throw truckloads of waste out behind the grocery store to satiate the drive to consume on demand. People die while others sit in their comfortable yachts eating caviar purchased with ill gotten warmongering money. \n\nI hope this changes. But as a realist I don't expect it to. The oligarchs and those with the power to make serious change prove every day they're willing to let the world burn before they give it up. The change that is always promised is \"right over this hill\". This is the source of my growing dread. And it's only getting worse. I fear the storm is almost upon us. \n\nTL;DR we are frogs in the pot and the world's burner is on high.

In particular, it's interesting to me how people have these 'concerns' about where trans people go to pee.\n\nI am trans. I find these conversations entertaining because of how strong the opinions of anti-trans people are, yet on the other hand, this is an 'issue' which their opinion has no real bearing on anything at all regardless of how they feel about it. It's a guilty pleasure of mine to get stoned, read these anti-trans dipshit's comments, and laugh at how stupid they are.\n\n> **\"bathrooms are and have always been single sex spaces\"**\n\nIt's weird people assume these things. Trans people have been using the bathroom of their gender for decades. That hasn't really changed since the recent panic fabricated as a wedge issue by the Republican party. The way things are is the way things have been. Conveniently I think this rephrasing of the past is either based on ignorance or to frame trans people as some kind of invaders in spaces they've always been in.\n\n> **\"well, if we let trans people into the bathroom of their gender, they might assault someone\"**\n\nWe should also get rid of guns since people might shoot someone. We should operate on presumption of guilt for people and assume guilty until innocent. If we do this, maybe we can start by assuming all cis men are guilty of assault until proven innocent since that demographic seems to assault women the most... any issues with this?\n\nAssault is illegal.\n\n> **\"this allows people to pretend they are trans and go into the bathroom and assault someone\"**\n\nIf someone is going to rape or assault someone, a sign on the door won't change that. We don't have to strip someone's access to public facilities due to concerns about some unrelated bad actor possibly performing acts of evil. If someone wants to pretend to be trans and go assault a bunch of people, that's not great... but what the fuck does that have to do with people like me though. I'm just tryina pee.\n\n> **\"but what if there's a penis\"**\n\nThis one always makes me laugh because of how juvenile the concern is. Yeah... what if there *was* a penis? Is this covid related? And if so, *what do we do about it?*\n\nI donno about you people, but I've never seen a penis in the bathroom. Even in the men's room, when men use the urinal, seeing someone's junk means someone is doing something wrong. Indecent exposure last I checked is already a crime. A dick isn't required (except the person being one); a cis woman can go out in public and riff off her vag like she's playing a guitar and people are gonna have a problem with it (I would fucking hope). When you act unhinged and like a psycho, I don't think genitals or having a penis has much to do with it. Can we stop worrying about what's in someone's pants? You don't need to know what's in mine. I don't want to know what's in yours. You could be hiding a subway sandwich in there for later and I don't need to know about it because you'll be using a bathroom stall.\n\n> **\"why cant they just use the men's room. they make me uncomfortable\"**\n\nYes, I agree. As a trans woman, cis women make me uncomfortable and I think they should just use the men's room. Society does not need to cater towards the comfort of cis women. There isn't any safety concern with men using the men's room, so why can't cis women also use the men's room? If people don't want cis women using the men's room, why should I use the men's room? I know who and what I am. I don't need other people's help taking a shit.\n\nWe could go over these stupid talking points all day but at the end of the day, the funny thing is, these are talking points.\n\n**This leads to my final point**, that these anti trans bathroom talking points are incredibly stupid, but *they also don't fucking matter*. People can carry their opinions about where people like myself pee to the grave. Their opinions are irrelevant. We can have a 3 hour discussion about the nuance about where people like myself choose to take a shit and I'll continue to not give one, but at the end of the day, these discussions won't change a damn thing. At best, an anti trans reactionary becomes marginally more afraid to go out in public (a good thing lmao), and at worst, collectively, society decides to implement more unenforceable laws that primarily affect and hurt gender nonconforming (and often cis, butch) women.\n\nI look like a woman, am a woman. I've used the women's restroom. I've never had a problem.\n\nPeople can have these discussions about where people should pee all day but I already know which bathroom to use. Please, spend hours debating over what bathroom you think trans people should use. It's entertaining to me, and at the end of the day, it won't change a damn thing.\n\nOr maybe we can find a better discussion topic.\n\nPS: Can't wait for the next \/u\/lilqueerkid post here.

( https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/321143\/americans-stand-abortion.aspx ) Abortion was a fantastic issue for the right for decades, because it was always low-hanging fruit to get voters to the polls. When the Republican party married itself to Evangelical Christianity in the late 70s and early 80s, they made restricting abortion a political, moral, and spiritual cornerstone of their party. Save babies - vote Republican!\n\nBut ever since Roe was repealed, it's been a double-whammy against the GOP. First, now their voters aren't as motivated to vote. Why would they be? The one issue that single-issue voters cared about has now been \"solved.\" And since the Supreme Court made it so that it's up to states to decide what restrictions should be on abortion access, once a red state enacts a huge restriction or ban on abortion, there's no risk of it being overturned unless a Constitutional amendment passes - which won't happen at a federal level.\n\nThe shoe is now on the other foot - now voters who DO care about abortion are especially motivated to vote. And why would they vote for the GOP politicians who overturned their right to an abortion in the first place? Since Roe was repealed, the GOP has seen massive backlashes in several states that once leaned red or were deep purple. ( https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/us\/how-abortion-could-impact-2024-us-elections-2023-12-14\/ ) The 2022 election, which had been expected to deliver a large amount of seats to Republicans, fell flat for them instead. Conservative states like Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky have had election results turn in favor of pro-reproductive right initiatives (and thus Democrats over Republicans). And horror stories about the \"unintended\" consequences of banning abortion - which were screamed from the rooftops by liberals and widely ignored or mocked as being unrealistic by conservatives - are constantly popping up in the news, keeping the issue fresh in the minds of voters. People are horrified when reading about women forced to keep miscarried fetuses, or birth children who die within days in horrible pain, or forcing underage rape victims to give birth. Doctors - especially those involved in OB-GYN capacities, are fleeing from the states with the worst restrictions, impacting everyone seeking healthcare.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/news\/roe-gop-abortion-restrictions\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/09\/06\/us\/politics\/abortion-obstetricians-maternity-care.html\n\nArizona in particular is a good example because the state is very narrowly blue and Trump lost there last election. It was expected to be a key battleground state for the 2024 election, but with the AZ Supreme Court ruling, AZ voters are extremely riled up. Riled up people tend to turn out to vote, making the GOP campaigns both locally and nationally much more difficult.\n\nSo yes, any republican you hear saying that there is going to be a \u201cred wave\u201d or some such nonsense this November is coping on levels never seen before. They are going to need a miracle to win the election. \n\n","title":"More and more it\u2019s looking like Republicans will need a miracle to win the election this year","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1c33h40\/more_and_more_its_looking_like_republicans_will\/"}

They probably won't forget about the endless articles from NBC, CNN, Politico et al about how Biden is only functional from 10 AM to 4 PM or that unnamed Democratic members of Congress want him to drop out. It's no secret that the media (and not just Fox News) wants Trump back in the White House - his presidency was the best thing that ever happened to their ratings.\n\nI can only speak to my family and immediate friends, but we were all very alarmed by Biden's debate performance. But it just made us want to volunteer more, and I did a phone bank session in Virginia the day after the debate. Additionally, Biden's best fundraising hour was between 11 PM and 12 AM the night of the debate, so it could be that those most disturbed by his debate performance were always going to vote for any Democrat against Trump. I think that's what we have to hope for.\n\nYes, I wish Biden had taken questions after his 5-minute speech about the immunity ruling. But if you think that most of these questions would not have been some variation of \"Are you going to drop out?\", you're kidding yourself. Hopefully he'll have other chances to demonstrate that he is up to the task.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Biden isn't going to drop out, and we (not necessarily us, but Democrats at large) do him (and by extension, this country) a disservice by fostering the narrative that he might drop out.

To summarize, a girl, who is white, was invited on stage to sing along with the rapper, who is black, a song that contains the word \"nigga\" throughout. Whilst singing the song she used the word nigga, as the lyrics state which prompted Kendrick to stop the song and boot her of the stage for saying the word and that she should have *bleeped* it. \n\nI have a few topics for discussion to hopefully gain better understanding of the issues surrounding the word. \n\nTo my knowledge, it is the only word in english language that is rarely spoken or written fully and almost always abbreviated due to its negative meaning. The word, that is in the [dictionary.com](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/nigger), [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nigger), [Oxford Dictionary](https:\/\/www.oed.com\/viewdictionaryentry\/Entry\/126934) etc., is often written as \"N-word\". I am fully aware of the history of the word, how it originated, how it was used and how, even today, it is still used with derogatory connotations. What I don't understand why isn't the word spoken or written instead of the alternative \"N-word\". Are they doing it out of respect? Are they afraid of being [canceled](https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/words-at-play\/cancel-culture-words-were-watching)*?*  Everybody knows what the word is when using the term \"N-word\", so why not just say it? If the word that everybody knows but must not be said directly, is so insulting by mere saying or writing, why is it ever used anywhere ever? *(queue next paragraph)*\n\nIf one were to call someone a nigger, by default it would be considered an insult. But, if the person saying the word is black, the word would mean a man or a person. I always thought that a word has a set meaning in a context that you use it, not the color of the skin of the person saying it. I can make the word pancake have a derogatory meaning, depending in which context I'm using the word. So, why can a person who is black use the word in what ever context they see fit, yet other races cannot, even with positive intentions (like the girl who was singing a song)?\n\nI've heard arguments that \"they are taking the word back\" so they are *allowed*. Taking the word back from whom? The racist people? They are gonna say what ever they want. Maybe taking back the word means that it does not mean something negative and but something positive, like [some words have in the past](https:\/\/www.mentalfloss.com\/article\/65987\/13-words-changed-negative-positive-or-vice-versa)? In that case people should be encouraged to use the word in a positive manner.\n\nSingers have used the word in their songs for a while now. Their songs are listened by all races, now more than ever. Because they are using those words in their song, they are, in my opinion, *normalizing* the word to have a meaning, in most cases, a man or a person. I honestly don't know when and if the word and its meaning is taught in school, but I know that the first time I've heard it, it was in a rap song and it seemed to me like a perfectly normal word at the time - a slang word for a person. \n\nWhat about the so called \"N-word pass\"? If the word is so insulting by mere saying or writing it publicly causes such distress, how can one black person allow a non-black person to say it? Does that one person represent all black people so that he can make that decision? (I may be nit-picking with this paragraph, but the point still stands)\n\nWhat is your opinion? Should we, as humans, reduce the use of the word \"nigger\", regardless of the person saying it? Should we normalize a different meaning to the word (a man or a person)? Do you think it is ok for a black person to say, but not for other races? If so why?","title":"Why is there a lot of stigma regarding the use of a word \"nigger\"?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/kit2iq\/why_is_there_a_lot_of_stigma_regarding_the_use_of\/"}

Because of this I believe there is a gross double standard between the ways the actions between democrats and republicans have been treated this election. For me, I think this is the most unhinged Donald Trump has been on either of his 3 campaigns. Here are a few things that he\u2019s said\/done this campaign that would be utterly disqualifying for any other candidate: \n1. Said illegal immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country. (Literal Nazi line and comes straight from mein kempf.)\n2. Has called democrats the \u201cenemy from within\u201d\n3. Purported false and debunked stories of haitians immigrants (who are there legally btw) of them eating cats and dogs. Haitians in springfield reported getting death threats after that. \n4. Admitted to the whole country on national tv he has no healthcare plan after vowing for 9 straight years he would get rid of obamacare. \n5. Still lies about January 6th and recently called it a day of love. (4 people died)\n6. Has called Kamala Harris a communist\n7. Implied she is mentally impaired \n8. Implying he would use the military against citizen protesting\n9. Instead of actually caring about the victims of the hurricane he purports false claims about FEMA allocating money to illegal immigrants and not having enough for the hurricane aid. \n10. Called Victor Orban, who is known to be a dictator, a good leader on national tv\n\n These are just off the top of my head and don\u2019t really care to list them all out but trust me there is more. The reason I bring it up is because whenever these things happen the media will just be like \u201cYeah, but you know trump is trump, we know what he is \u201d. And like\u2026why?\nWhy is that the standard? Why is the standard for trump to act and speak like an authoritarian fascist and for us to expect that of him?

Just discussion with no will to impose any of my views on anyone.\n\nI took a psychology class in high school once and found out in that class alone just how much information people are missing in terms of, oh, I don't know... literally everything! The takeaway I got from this class shaped the thought that many parents have no clue how to raise a child and are causing more harm than good with their complacency in ignorance of childhood development.\n\nUnderstanding general psychology can help with so much from learning about what to prepare for as they hit certain age ranges, to readily being there for them when changes arrive (and being able to communicate to them how to handle those changes), to knowing how to look out for mental illnesses\/disorders that aren't just a result of their age behavior. Not only that, but it helps with learning how to discipline them effectively without causing trauma to the kid.\n\nEven more so, I feel this understanding is necessary as we have millions of children without a parent or guardian to care for them. As a large population, I find it extremely irresponsible to have children without having the proper knowledge and ability to take care of them from 0-18 years. The same way we're told to be financially ready, we should be emotionally ready and mentally ready, and knowledgeable. It's important to know that you're caring for a child during the years that build a person's whole foundation. Those years shape their morals, their behavior, their habits, and so much more. Childhood development will directly affect their future. \n\nI also hold these views towards common household pets or other animals that people decide to care for. Humans are animals, too, and these other animal species' lives deserve just as much understanding as human ones if you plan on caring for them.","title":"People should have an understanding of child development and psychology before having children.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/hqew4w\/people_should_have_an_understanding_of_child\/"}

The constitution and laws in general no longer apply to republicans and their friends. The DOJ is being weaponized to serve the corrupt political interests of the GOP elites (namely Trump himself). Unsurprisingly they are ignoring all the blatant law breaking by Trump's administration. All this signal shit was in no way legal, especially all the lying to congress under oath about it. This should result in criminal prosecutions, but no one was even so much as fired let alone indicted. They're openly defying court orders to rob people of due process and deport them to countries they're not even from with no evidence they ever committed a crime. They're snatching up people on the streets just for having the wrong political opinions and throwing them in concentration camps. \n\nThe situation is like a bully who has decided to start picking on another kid. He's started slapping him and spitting him and being all like, what are you gonna do about it? The only restitution for this law breaking by the chief executive our legal system gives us is to have the members of congress impeach and remove the president and appoint a new one. They do this as many times as it takes to get to someone who will respect the rule of law. Republicans have shown in Trump's first administration that they will not do this. Even despite his way worse and more flagrant lawbreaking in his second term, they still back him wholeheartedly. \n\nThe republicans are now operating outside the legal system in effect while maintaining a thin veneer of legality simply by being in power through the legal electoral process. The one question remains, to what extent have they already or will they start rigging the elections. Obviously there's no moral impediment for them anymore considering they're literally a gang of lawbreaking thugs who treat the constitution as toilet paper. They don't care if rigging the election isn't legal. They'll do it if they can so they can continue this farce. They don't care that we can see them breaking all these laws either, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's something obvious. All they need is the excuse to seize power by saying \"we won\". It doesn't matter if people know it's a lie. Think about all the other things they've lied about despite all of us clearly knowing it's a lie. If they've done it before, why wouldn't they do it again?\n\nEventually the kid who is getting bullied and slapped around has two options. One, live life being constantly picked on by this bully, or two, fight back. If the republicans have already started operating outside the law, I fear that will force their opposition to also operate outside the law. The only thing that has the potential to stop this from happening would be the republicans for some reason deciding not to go through with rigging\/stealing the election (despite Trump already LITERALLY having tried to do this in 2020), and the elections resulting in a strong democratic majority which can reinstate the rule of law. \n\nThis is some heavy shit when you think about the implications of what is happening right now so I wanted to open this up to see what other people think about it. Do you think the electoral process will save us? If it doesn't, do you think we can come out of this period of lawlessness and corruption without violence?","title":"Trump and the republicans are en masse doing away with the rule of law in this country.

In Europe, even outside the city centers, suburbs are far more walkable and connected. Public transportation is widely available, and while homes and backyards may be smaller and more compact, this trade-off creates communities where people can easily walk to shops, schools, and parks. In contrast, American suburbs prioritize larger houses and bigger backyards, but everything is far more spread out and isolated. Walkable neighborhoods are rare, especially outside major cities, because zoning laws in the U.S. don\u2019t allow mixed-use spaces where residential, commercial, and recreational areas coexist.\n\nThis car-centric design creates significant barriers to social interaction. In Europe, a 16-year-old can bike to a friend\u2019s house or take public transportation to the movies independently. This encourages young people to socialize, develop independence, and explore their communities. In America, teenagers often rely on their parents to drive them everywhere because biking or walking is not a safe or realistic option. Whether you\u2019re driving five minutes to the grocery store or 40 minutes across town, you\u2019re stuck using a car because there are no alternatives like sidewalks, bike lanes, or reliable public transportation. This not only creates congestion but also isolates individuals, especially those who don\u2019t drive or simply can't afford a car.\n\nEven neighborhoods that appear to be pedestrian-friendly with walking trails often feel empty and isolated. The problem is there\u2019s nowhere meaningful to walk to that is within walking distance\u2014no local stores, public spaces, or \"third places\" like caf\u00e9s or community centers where people naturally gather and build relationships. When you walk around American suburbs, you rarely see neighbors interacting. This is partly because the environment isn\u2019t designed to encourage it. For example, when I lived in the U.S., there was a movie theater and a trampoline park less than half a mile away, but my parents still had to drive us there because there were no sidewalks, and the roads were unsafe to cross on foot. Similarly, I\u2019ve seen neighborhoods where schools, houses, and parks sit close to each other on the same street, yet there are no sidewalks, forcing people to walk in the road, which is dangerous. In apartment complexes, restaurants or stores might be across the street, but high-speed traffic and poorly designed intersections make even a short walk feel unsafe and inaccessible.\n\nIn countries like Switzerland, kids bike to school and move around freely, learning independence and socializing with ease because the infrastructure supports it. In America, however, the reliance on cars limits opportunities for young people and adults alike to spontaneously interact or explore their communities. Walkable neighborhoods allow people to leave their homes more often and connect with others naturally. If you live in a walkable place where you can get to a coffee shop, park, or store on foot, you\u2019re far more likely to go out and engage and natrually meet people from your local area   instead of spending the day indoors.\n\nUltimately, America\u2019s car-centric urban design plays a major role in the loneliness epidemic. To address this, we need to rethink how we build our neighborhoods. Investing in sidewalks, safe bike lanes, and public transportation is essential to make communities more connected. Zoning laws should encourage mixed-use development, integrating homes with shops, parks, and public spaces to foster vibrant, walkable environments. By designing neighborhoods that prioritize people over cars, we can create healthier, more social communities where people naturally connect and feel less isolated.\n\n","title":"The Main Cause Of America Loneliness Epidemic.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1hg3fqe\/the_main_cause_of_america_loneliness_epidemic\/"}

I'm a 19 year old girl born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. My mom is 59 and was born and raised in Miami, Florida until she was 18. (Not sure if this is necessary to note, but my mom is a Christian who was Baptized at 16, I think. I'm a former Christian who recently became an agnostic atheist, though I haven't directly told anyone this.)\n\nMy mom is very pro-black, for lack of a better term. She watches a lot of politics and news reports surrounding black people and cares about what society is doing to black people. She also occasionally watches Dr. Umar Johnson and supports what he says. (I don't watch him and I'm not the biggest fan of him, but I digress.) It's understandable and agreeable to care about marginalized groups, which naturally would include black people. However, sometimes my mom says things that go a little too far.\n\nTake this discussion's example; My mom believes that good white people don\u2019t exist. She believes only decent white people exist and her reasoning for this is because if good white people existed, then we wouldn't still have this racist white system in society. They would be trying to abolish it instead of upholding it.\n\nTrue, racist white people do exist and are solely responsible for this racist system. (Remember what happened to the Native Americans, anyone?) However, it's kinda foolish to believe that ALL white people agree with the system or willingly support it. In fact, there are white people who are actively trying to fight against it and who've been fighting it for years.\n\nIt's not modern white people's fault that they also live in the same racist system as everybody else. None of them asked to be white, just like how I didn't ask to be black. However, that doesn't mean white people can't learn about the world we live in and overcome the racist mentality that's so heavily ingrained into society.\n\nThere's way more stuff my mom has said that's kinda outta pocket. I'm not gonna get fully into it, but my mom cares about black people a little bit too much, kinda to the point where she sort of puts black people's problems above other marginalized groups of people.\n\n* (She believes the problems the LGBTQ community faces should remain separate from the problems black people face.\n* She thinks white people are the scourge of the Earth.\n* I remember her telling me that I should be able to date a man of any race, but she would prefer if I date a black man.)\n* She hates Kamala Harris because she believes she's not gonna do anything\/hasn't done anything to support black people. (Whether or not this is true is NOT the main point of this discussion. Keep political talk to a minimum, PLEASE! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n* She criticizes black people (mainly black men) for dating outside their race because whatever money their non-black partner has will be passed down to their mixed race kids instead of black kids)\n\nBut, today I overheard her talking to my older sister and my mom said that. She\u2019s said it before in the past, but I forgot about it until today.\n\nAnyways, vent over.","title":"My mom doesn\u2019t believe good white people exist.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1g26tk5\/my_mom_doesnt_believe_good_white_people_exist\/"}

However, I was surprised to see that there are actually conservatives that agree with this line of thinking and are voting for trump for this specific reason and this couldn\u2019t be more funny to me.

So, again, the idea that Trump doesn't know about or endorse project 2025 is bullshit. \n\nVance has famously stated that he is against abortion in 100% of potential cases, and responded to a question about rape exceptions that pregnancy shouldn't be seen as an \"inconvenience\", which: damn, what a psychotic thing to say.\n\nOn no-fault divorce, Vance states: \"This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is the idea that like, 'well, okay, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy - and so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that's going to make people happier in the long term,\" Vance told the moderator in the video published by VICE.\"\n\nVance has also stated he would follow Trump's command if Trump demanded he overturn another election (https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/politics\/2024\/07\/16\/jd-vance-questioned-2020-election-results\/74294067007\/). His senate seat was essentially purchased outright by Peter Thiel and Marc Andreesen ( https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/peter-thiel-jd-vance-veep-trump-election-kingmaker-2024-7). Thiel is a black-eyed demon who openly wants to end democracy (https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2023\/11\/peter-thiel-2024-election-politics-investing-life-views\/675946\/), and by choosing Vance as a running mate, the Trump campaign has traded Mike Pence's Christian nationalism for reactionary capitalism. Historically, that *has* been how you get fascism.\n\nAnyway: It really has to suck to have to pretend that these people don't know about or endorse project 2025 when Trump already carried out nearly all of the last Heritage foundation plan during his first administration. It's ludicrous to pretend that the heritage foundation\/project 2025 are anything other than mainstream American conservatism.","title":"Trump knows so little about the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025 that he picked their candidate for vice president.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1e4r4tl\/trump_knows_so_little_about_the_heritage\/"}

They secretly did their votes when the  official, duly appointed electors signed off on  by the Governor did there's to try and pass off themsleves as real as possible. They, at times without the knowledge of the Fake electors themsleves, then sent their fraudulent votes to Congress. \n\n\n\nTheir setting up and plotting of all of this is well documented.\n\n\u201cWe would just be sending in \u2018fake\u2019 electoral votes to Pence so that \u2018someone\u2019 in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes, and start arguing that the \u2018fake\u2019 votes should be counted,\u201d Jack Wilenchik, a Phoenix-based lawyer who helped organize the pro-Trump electors in Arizona, wrote in a Dec. 8, 2020, email to Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign.\n\n\n\u201cHis idea is basically that all of us (GA, WI, AZ, PA, etc.) have our electors send in their votes (even though the votes aren\u2019t legal under federal law \u2014 because they\u2019re not signed by the Governor); so that members of Congress can fight about whether they should be counted on January 6th,\u201d Mr. Wilenchik wrote in the email on Dec. 8, 2020, one week before the official duly appointed electors met to cast their votes, to Mr. Epshteyn and half a dozen other people.\n\nTrump himself preassured state legislators to overturn the election. Most notably goergias SOS, whom he told there would be nothing wrong with saying they've recalculated based on the unsubstantiated claims Trump was making. Telling him he knew what they did and if he didn't do something that would be criminal and bad for him and his lawyer. That the courts are a game and that phone call ultimately ends in Trump wins. He even held the guys upcoming election over his head as a reason he should do it fast and favor him..\n\n\n\nYou can read and listen to the full Goergia call here: https:\/\/www.americanoversight.org\/document\/georgia-secretary-of-state-recording-of-trump-phone-call-to-election-investigator\n\n\nNotable moments from the Goergia Call\n\n\n\n\nPart 1------\n\n\nBrad Raffensburger \"Mr. [unintelligible] you have people that submit information as we have our people that submit information. And then it comes before the court. And the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: \"why do you say that? I don\u2019t know. I mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say?\"\n\n\n\"Your numbers are right. But your numbers aren\u2019t right. They\u2019re really wrong, and they\u2019re really wrong Brad. And I know this phone call\u2019s going nowhere other than other than ultimately, you know, look, ultimately I win.\"\n\nPart 2-----------\n\nRAFFENSPERGER: We believe that we do have an accurate election.\n\n\n\nTRUMP: No, no, you don\u2019t. No, no, you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have, you don\u2019t have. Not\neven close. You\u2019re off by hundreds of thousands of votes.\"\n\n\n\"In Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting.\"\n\n\n\n\"We won every state, we won every statehouse in the country. We held the Senate, which is shocking to people, although we\u2019ll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the house, but we won every single statehouse and we won Congress\"\n\nPart 3------------\n\n\n\nTrump: \"We have we have we have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with with saying that Brad\"\n\n\n\"You know, I mean, having having a correct \u2014 the people of Georgia are angry and these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night along with others that we\u2019re going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even, and the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you\u2019ve recalculated\"\n\n\nPart 4-------------\n\n\"you know what they did and you\u2019re not reporting it. That\u2019s a criminal \u2014 that\u2019s a criminal offense. And you can\u2019t let that happen. That\u2019s a big risk to\nyou and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that\u2019s a big risk.\"\n\n\nPart 5---------\n\nTrump:  \"Honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election, election coming up and because of what you\u2019ve done to the president, you know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam.\n\n\nAnd because of what you\u2019ve done to the president, a lot of people aren\u2019t going out to vote and a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. OK. They hate him. And they\u2019re going to vote. And you would be respected if really respected if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And therefore, I think that it really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers, because I know, Brad, that if if you think we\u2019re right, I think you\u2019re going to say and I\u2019m not looking to blame anybody. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just saying that that, you know, you know, under new counts and under new views of the election results, we won the election.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s very simple. We won the election, as the governor of major states in the surrounding states said there is no way you lost Georgia. As the Georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost Georgia. Nobody, everyone knows I won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don\u2019t get this thing straightened out fast.\"\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Trump Is still a threat, the shooting changes nothing regarding him and his cohorts documented actions.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1e3xdku\/trump_is_still_a_threat_the_shooting_changes\/"}

His one-page bill deems that the CFPB rule limiting junk fees \"shall have no force or effect.\"  \nLawful and contractually agreed upon payment incentives promote financial discipline and responsibility, and this rule shows that the CFPB is more focused on scoring political talking points than policies that protect consumers,\" Scott said in a statement posted to his website.  \nScott's push to overhaul the Biden administration's limit on junk fees has the full support of the banking industry's top lobbyists and trade associations. Scott's statement noted that his bill was supported by the \"Consumer Bankers Association, America\u2019s Credit Unions, Independent Community Bankers of America, Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Americans for Tax Reform, Competitive Enterprise Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce.\"  \nAdam Green, a progressive activist who helped Biden organize events in the swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania to highlight his opposition to junk fees, told Dayen that the GOP openly railing against junk fees is a gift to Democrats ahead of the November election.  \nWe\u2019ve seen Democratic unity on fighting surprise junk fees and naming corporate villains like credit card companies, banks, and airlines,\" Green said. \"What\u2019s been missing is opponents smoking themselves out and raising the volume of this fight so the public knows who is on their side.\"  \nDayen further explained that because the US Senate is controlled by Democrats, Scott's bill is virtually guaranteed to fail passage. According to Dayen, all the \"doomed vote\" on the bill would accomplish is putting Republicans officially on the record in favor of jacking up excessive fees on Americans. He added that even 72% of self-identifying Republicans polled in December of 2023 were in favor of banning junk fees.  \n\"If you can believe it, Senate Republicans are actually trying to increase credit card fees for Americans. Democrats will not allow this bill to become law,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) tweeted.  \nhttps:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/news\/politics\/doomed-republicans-smoking-themselves-out-in-upcoming-vote-to-raise-credit-card-fees\/ar-BB1lz5CA?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=HCTS&cvid=b7b0452222a743fa8aaeb9c558de030d&ei=12","title":"Republicans continuing war against American consumers.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1c3sryn\/republicans_continuing_war_against_american\/"}

Basically, if you\u2019ve ever argued with a MAGA person on social media, they\u2019ll eventually accuse you of having \u201cTDS\u201d. In their twisted minds, you can\u2019t disagree with their infallible, supreme leader, and if you do, you must be mentally ill. This is cult like behavior. \n  \nHell, recently Minnesota republicans tried to pass a bill classifying TDS as a medical condition. This is beyond absurd. If you thought TDS was already projection, then this is a million lightyears outside of our galaxy level projection. \n  \nThe impetus for this post: I made the wonderful decision of arguing with a MAGA boomer on my FB. (Literal boomer, not slang.) I was arguing that Elon Musk is a Nazi sympathizer. The quickest examples I could think of was him sharing \/ liking Nazi posts on Twitter, literally sieg heil-ing at the inauguration, and he\u2019s not so subtly hinted that he\u2019s a holocaust denier. Hell, he was a keynote speaker at a recent far right German AfD party event! \n  \nSo, the MAGA guy responds by basically saying \u201cTV news melted your brain\u201d (I don\u2019t watch TV news) and \u201cyou sound deranged, you should seek professional help. I will pray for you.\u201d\n  \nThe \u201cI will pray for you\u201d almost made me pinch a hole through my fucking phone.

Elon had to hype up, inflate and lie about funding programs that helped people and smear Democrats like they were somehow pocketing funds. Absolutely nothing was or will be released by Elon that even slights the reputation of Republicans.

I do have a legitimate fear of white ppl and im not trying to karma farm or race bait. \n\nOk so to paint a picture. I'm mid 20s, mixed race, and aesthetically black AF. My skin color is light like caramel but my hair is very nappy. I'm a U.S resident and native. \n\nAnyway. Ive had this fear my whole life and I didn't even realize what I was experiencing was an actual fear until recently. I have experienced several traumatic events featuring white people. I had a cop hold me at gun point when I was 13, I've been discriminated against at pool parties, at school, and into my adult life I still experience dirty looks and discrimination. \n\nI have also experienced wholesome and positive interactions with white people, but these do not come as often in my opinion. Anyway, to the meat of the issue, I feel VERY uncomfortable around white people. It affects my life. One time, I was on vacation in Tennessee, and I stopped at a grocery store in a small town. I was the only black person in the vicinity and I was REALLY uncomfortable. I had to leave the store and send my friend in their to get the things I wanted. I couldn't cope with it. I get really antsy and heat flashes. Which I'm sure makes ppl look at me even more crazy. \n\nI'll avoid activities, events, or whatever, if there is not a diverse setting. I'll feel a lot more comfortable if I see a mix of Latinos and black people wherever I'm at. I have a hard time looking at white people in the eyes when I talk to them. I won't visit a white person's home unless I REALLY know them and even still, I'm always uncomfortable. If I get an Airbnb, I won't go for a walk around the neighborhood or use the neighborhood amenities available to me. \n\nRecently this fear has been significantly exasturbated in today's political climate. I see white ppl on tv chanting things about trump, flying confederate flags and trump flags, comments about DEI, and general intolerance displayed in the media and on social media has turned my fear damn near into a phobia. \n\nI have missed out on opportunities and good times, simply because I'm legitimately scared of being around white people. After years of having this fear, I'm tired of it. I live in Florida. My city is diverse. But even thinking about driving into the suburbs gives me heat flashes. Road trips give me serious anxiety, Especially at night. I can't afford a therapist to help me unpack some of the trauma I have experienced, so I'm opening up myself to everyone in the community to advice on how to cope with this issue. \n\nIn general, I can be around white people, work with white people, and befriend white people. But when there are too many of them, or if I'm the only black person around, I start experiencing panic attacks. \n\nHow can I get over my fear of white people? \n\n","title":"How do I get over my fear of white people?

To cap it all off, Trump casually tossed out an insidious conspiracy theory. He implies we don\u2019t know who shot him, when of course we do. Trump has been embedded in the public consciousness as a rule-breaker for so long that it can be easily to forget how far he is from fulfilling the basic requirement of a politician to speak clearly.\" (https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/opinion\/msnbc-opinion\/trump-age-harris-ramble-rcna168979)\n\nVeteran Boston Globe reporter Mike Barnicle recently said:\n \n\"\u201cWe have a damaged, delusional, old man who again might get reelected to the presidency of the United States,\u201d Mike Barnicle, who served as a longtime columnist for The Boston Globe and other newspapers, said on Morning Joe early Wednesday. Barnicle continued that Trump frequently says \u201cderanged\u201d things in public that \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t repeat\u201d on \u201cAmerican television\u201d or \u201cin front of your children.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Barnicle asked. Then he pointed a finger at his media colleagues. \u201cDonald Trump can say whatever crazy things he wants to say, about submarines, and sharks, and electric batteries,\u201d Barnicle said. He noted that such things are \u201cnot really covered\u201d as a window into \u201cwho the man is\u201d or a sign that he\u2019s \u201cout of his mind.\u201d (https:\/\/newrepublic.com\/article\/185622\/finally-top-journo-erupts-media-ignoring-trumps-mental-state)\n\nWill the media begin seriously reporting on Trump's mental decline now that it is negatively affecting his support?\n\n\"Trump\u2019s supporters are noticing. A Guardian reporter pointed out that during a recent rally in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, many audience members left as Trump rambled for nearly two hours. \u201cI voted for him in 2016 and had a Trump flag in the front yard,\u201d a member of that audience told The Guardian. \u201cBut after listening to that, I\u2019m actually afraid of Trump being president again. I don\u2019t know what he was talking about half the time. Perhaps he was always like that but he seems worse, more unstable.\u201d That tracks with reports from earlier in the campaign season of large numbers of audience members exiting Trump\u2019s speeches and supporter complaints about him \u201cbabbling.\u201d \n\nHow can Trump supporters continue to allow a clearly unwell, unfit old man to be forced in front of crowds like this? Is this *truly* the best the American conservative movement has to offer?","title":"Will the media start accurately reporting on Donald Trump's senility?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1f9qwip\/will_the_media_start_accurately_reporting_on\/"}

From what I understand, it's pretty bad and difficult to describe how bad. That was his life growing up. Surrounded by anti white racism. \n\nHe moves to Canada, builds up a few companies and does a pretty good job getting rich off other people's work and motivating people towards a goal. Which is great. All this time however, the people he's using were raised in a country that takes care of its people with a pretty good level of education and healthcare. \n\nHis move into the US probably sees a similar deal where he secures funding from the Government which, again, takes care of its people generally well and he's able to hire talent but fire whoever he wants. Giving him the perspective of basically dealing with educated, wealthy enough people to get by without a whole lot of health or other issues. \n\nSo his whole life has been basically trying to run people into the ground to get things done and he's never seen the consequences of burning people out because he's always had the money and ability to just fire and replace as he sees fit. While he's always able to take however much time he wants off and minimal health issues with plenty of resources to deal with it. \n\nSo now he's in a tall seat of power and he simply does not understand or appreciate the work and effort people have done to hold society together that made it so he had access to those well educated people and the funding he's had in his career. \n\nHe's had a few rough patches in his life, but they never really impacted him to get him to reflect on his situation or safety nets that kept him from just starving to death on the side of the road. \n\nAnd this is where we see the crossroads between a country and a company. \n\nA country has to raise people and take care of them. A company relies on a country's security and social structures to run and sees itself as better than the country. \n\nWhen he's been in USAID, he's been ripping apart and calling programs that help people as criminal and fraud, while ignoring Trumps daughter getting plenty of funding from USAID or the Trumpcoin rugpull, or really anything that's actual corruption. \n\nPeople are getting angry, that tax dollars are used to stabilize and help people. Literally angry at that, and ignoring the fraud that happened from Trumps covid stimulus or other issues. \n\nSo now he's talking about basically cutting America to the bone and bragging about it because, that's all he knows when it comes to business. You have to be selfish and greedy. That's how businesses work. The opposite of governing where you want families to grow up and be multi generational. \n\nI don't know, it's a thought, I needed to get it out there somewhere and see what others think. I want to give Elon some benefit of doubt here. We're watching a bunch of people with what could be considered a retirement income that never have to work for money ever again in their lives, seem to want to do nothing but make people as miserable and poor as possible and it's just, weird.","title":"I don't think Elon understands how running a country like a company is so bad for everyone.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1im11hs\/i_dont_think_elon_understands_how_running_a\/"}

For 48 percent of the 174 about whom we have some information, we have no information about their method of crossing into the United States.

About 100 relatives also signed a letter to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, but it contains no case-specific information.\n\nThe government calls them all \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d But of the 90 cases where the method of crossing is known, 50 men report that they came legally to the United States, with advanced US government permission, at an official border crossing point. A Reuters survey of 50 men also placed the proportion of those who entered legally at about half. This isn\u2019t surprising because about half of all the Venezuelans who have immigrated over the past two years came legally as well\u2014either as refugees, parolees, or visa holders. The proportion isn\u2019t what matters the most: the astounding absolute numbers are.

I said that when we use phrases like \u201cit\u2019s all men,\u201d we run the risk of alienating people who might actually be open to learning\u2014but aren\u2019t fully informed yet. That kind of broad messaging, while emotionally charged and understandable, often pushes people away who otherwise might have listened.\n\nI said that when people feel lumped in or talked down to, it creates resentment, and that resentment is exactly the kind of thing people like Andrew Tate feed on. He positions himself as the guy who \u201cgets\u201d them when everyone else calls them trash. And sadly, that works.\n\nWhat happened next?\nI got told to shut the fuck up.\nI got lectured on patriarchy like I hadn\u2019t already acknowledged it.\nI got dismissed as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d just for suggesting that strategy and communication matter.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the part that really pisses me off: I\u2019ve been hurt by women, too. Manipulated. Lied to. Emotionally torn apart. But I\u2019ve never walked away saying \u201cit\u2019s all women.\u201d I didn\u2019t become bitter. I didn\u2019t stop caring. I stuck around. I tried to be better. And when I finally speak up\u2014calmly, mind you\u2014just to say, \u201cHey, maybe there\u2019s a more effective way to reach people,\u201d I get shut down like I\u2019m the damn enemy.\n\nApparently, trying to critique the language means I\u2019m tone policing.\nApparently, giving a damn about how the message is received means I\u2019m fragile.\nApparently, caring about the cause but wanting it to actually work means I\u2019m just another guy in denial.\n\nI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just tired.\n\nTired of trying to be thoughtful and getting talked over.\nTired of making space for everyone else\u2019s experience while being told mine doesn\u2019t matter.\nTired of being treated like a punching bag just because I had the nerve to speak from the heart.\n\nCritique is not opposition.\nAsking if the message is effective is not tone policing.\nTrying to reach people who aren\u2019t already in the choir isn\u2019t betrayal\u2014it\u2019s strategy.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing a lot of people don\u2019t want to hear: this exact dynamic is part of why so many young men are being pushed into right-wing spaces and even voted for Trump.\nNot because they\u2019re inherently evil or hate women\u2014but because they feel unheard, dismissed, and villainized no matter what they say. When the only people who will \u201clisten\u201d to them are the loudest extremists, it creates a pipeline no one wants to admit exists.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there.\nThis isn\u2019t just about Tate. It\u2019s not just about Trump.\nThis kind of messaging\u2014and the way criticism of it is shut down\u2014is feeding a broader feedback loop on social media that is actively worsening the gender divide. You can see it everywhere: men and women talking past each other, mocking each other, retreating into increasingly hostile echo chambers.\nAnd it\u2019s not just digital noise. It\u2019s having real-world consequences. Loneliness. Extremism. Distrust. Broken relationships. Polarization. And if we keep pretending that pushing away nuance is the right path forward, things are only going to get worse.\n\nI care about this. I care about people. I care about real change.\n\nBut sometimes, it feels like caring just makes you a target.\n\nThanks for letting me get this off my chest.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nI tried to respectfully critique the phrase \u201cit\u2019s all men\u201d and got shut down, insulted, and labeled part of the problem. I wasn\u2019t denying patriarchy\u2014I was pointing out that this kind of language can alienate potential allies, fuel resentment, and feed toxic figures like Andrew Tate. It\u2019s not tone policing to ask if the message is actually working. This kind of one-sided messaging is worsening the gender divide on social media and in real life, and it\u2019s already having serious consequences.

They have had 50 years to prove it works and we're still watching gofundme programs for life saving procedures, victims of mass shootings and similar events paying for it, covid victims racking up million dollar bills... Americans are getting charged at rates that, with insurance, is still more expensive than other countries. \n\nOne CEO gets taken out, out of his providers service by the way so expect his family to get hit with the medical bills of a useless ambulance ride, whatever treatment they gave him out of network then a double slap with funeral bills. Something millions of Americans have had to deal with while fighting the systems this man put up. \n\nThis system, doesn't work. \n\nFire Departments and Police work.

We see other countries seem to have a pretty good grip on how to make single payer work. The United States Military has a great healthcare system set up for its troops, again, when Republicans stop trying to cut funding for service members and vets so they can shove a bunch of middle men in the system. \n\nRepublicans are also the only ones telling us we can't do anything about our kids getting shot. They throw a fit about transgender people or really anything that doesn't fit their sexual fantasies, but they seem to just celebrate school shootings with gun sales and gun pins on their suits. \n\nI don't even know what kind of good discussion that can come from this. I'm just so frustrated with this being the year after year bs. \n\nJust for added measure Republicans are also the only reason we have to go through middlemen to pay taxes so they can collect your data and sell it. Same with everything else they privatize and \"oops!\" got hacked but paid. All your info is out there now. Good thing Republicans keep lobbyists to pay Republicans to keep all this crap going. \n\nHere's a list of just how fucked up Republicans are and it's stupid. And no, I'm not a boot licking Democrat, I have my issues with them, but they are so overshadowed by the problems Republicans don't just bring to the table but go to war over it's stupid. \n\nClimate change? Too hard, can't stop it.\n\nCovid? Too hard, can't do anything about it, Obama's fault.\n\nPaying our national debt? Class war, can't do it, gut funding for the poor. \n\nStop school shootings? Womp womp.\n\nStreamline voting? Nope nope nope. We'll purge your voter rolls if you're a democrat. \n\nFact checking? Too biased towards liberals. \n\nStop terrorism? Nah let's give the Taliban a country and release their prisoners. \n\nHelp our vets? Too expensive. Cut funding, let them die. \n\nA priest molests kids? He's a good man. \n\nPutin invades a peaceful country that had an agreement of peace if they got rid of nuclear weapons? Can't stop him. Let's just give Putin whatever he wants for peace. \n\nSanction Russia for Putin's behavior? Too hard, lift the sanctions.\n\nTrump is a felon and committed fraud multiple times?

All you have to do to realize just how stupid it is is to ask \"why, really?\" Who wrote the dictionary definitions (plural) of \"gender\"? Why is it disrespectful to call someone a nickname they don't want to be called, but not disrespectful to call someone a name they don't want to be called? Why is it harmful for a child to see a man in woman's clothing but not to see a man in an easter buddy costume or in the lion king on broadway? If a transgender person walks into the men's room and no one knows he was assigned female at birth, does he make a sound?\n\nThese people who cannot ask themselves \"why, really\" do not know the difference between justified and arbitrary. That's why education looks like indoctrination: they've only ever known indoctrination. That's why they and we as a country need to be building education up.

If all that has taught me anything, it\u2019s that human beings are reliably terrible at innately comprehending and gauging risk. We are at the same time prone to grossly overestimate the actual risk of certain threats, while vastly underestimating other threats. Take vocal opposition to nuclear energy, for instance. A lot of people are terrified of the prospect of being near or downwind of a nuclear meltdown. Fair enough, however, in the 70 years since the first full scale civilian nuclear power plant went active, nuclear energy has proven to be far and away the safest source of electricity we have, with fewer attributable deaths per megawatt hour produced than any other electricity source, including wind and power. The problem is, people mistake \u201chazard\u201d for \u201crisk.\u201d What would happen to you if you were exposed to radiation from a nuclear meltdown is the hazard, but risk is more than just hazard. Risk is the intersection of hazard and exposure; it factors in the severity of the hazard something presents along with the likelihood of being exposed to that hazard.\n\nThe \u201dman or bear\u201d so-called \u201cthought experiment\u201d attempts to exploit humans\u2019 misunderstanding of hazard vs risk, especially a common overestimation of the risk of wild animal attacks, but gets hazard\/risk wrong in every way possible. This isn\u2019t just a matter of semantics, or an academic nitpick; the confusion the \u201cthought experiment\u201d creates is actually counterproductive to the important end goal of women being able to be safer in society.\n\nThe conclusion behind this viral meme is that most women would feel safer encountering a bear in the woods than a man because of the low number of bear attacks and the high number of cases of violence against women. This is the first major mistake this meme makes, and it\u2019s all about exposure. The reason there are so few bear attacks is because there are only about \\~300,000 bears in all of North America to begin with, and those bears a dispersed throughout rural and wilderness areas where human population is low, while the vast majority of people spend most or all of their time in urbanized areas where there are no bears to be exposed to. Conversely, there are \\~165 million men in the US alone, and a woman is likely to cross paths with multiple men every day, that\u2019s a level of exposure many orders of magnitude higher than exposure to a bear, so of course risk is going to be higher across a population even in hazard is much lower, that\u2019s just how the math works.\n\nBut once a woman is out in the woods, and actually encounters a bear, or a man, \u00a0the relative exposure factor of the risk equation is out the window, you\u2019re already exposed, and now it\u2019s all about raw hazard. And this is where the meme makes its second major, and arguably more serious blunder \u2013 its misunderstanding of hazard. The hazard bears (or any other large animal you might encounter in the wild) present to humans they encounter is pretty evenly distributed across all bears. Sure, a mother bear, or a bear that has been habituated to human presence may present a somewhat elevated hazard, but by and large, any individual bear you come across has a relatively high hazard quotient by virtue of being several times larger and stronger than us, with big sharp pointy teeth and claws, and being wild animals and thus their behavior not being very predictable (even those not on cocaine) by the average hiker. The average individual human male, on the other hand, has a much lower hazard quotient \u2013 not only are we much closer to human females in size and lacking in teeth and claws, but we also have culture, social mores, and laws that the vast majority of human males abide by, and on top of that, because men and women are of the same species women innately understand human behavior better than they do bear behavior and can better judge whether a man might be a high hazard man or not. That\u2019s the key thing, while bears are high hazard animals across the board, and present that hazard equally to any human who encounters them, hazard is not evenly distributed in men at all, nor is vulnerability to high-hazard men evenly distributed among all women. Unprovoked assault of strangers is heavily concentrated among men from low socioeconomic groups, vulnerability to violence, especially sexual violence, is heavily concentrated among women, and \u2013 here is the big one \u2013 a woman is FAR more likely to be victimized by a man she knows than by a stranger.\n\nThe fact that a woman is far more likely to be sexually victimized by someone she knows, far more likely to be assaulted or killed by an intimate partner than a stranger, is particularly damning of the \u201cbear or man\u201d so-called \u201cthought experiment.\u201d I was a little kid in the early 1980s when cases like the murder of Adam Walsh (son of John Walsh of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d) helped ignite the \u201cStranger Danger\u201d moral panic. \u00a0Cases of children being kidnapped by strangers were and still are extremely rare, but that didn\u2019t stop parents from focusing on that hazard, while the country neglected the fact that most child sexual abuse and kidnapping is committed by a member of the family or a close friend of the family, just as the \u201cman or bear\u201d meme perpetuates an idea about men being potential rapists of any women they come across, while neglecting to focus on the real problems of acquaintance rape and intimate partner abuse\/murder. That\u2019s the problem with simplistic, sensationalistic, and poorly conceived talking points like the \u201cman or bear\u201d meme.\n\nIdeas like these aren\u2019t just unhelpful, they are harmful and counterproductive. The focus on \u201cstranger danger\u201d didn\u2019t just set back awareness of family\/friend\/teacher sexual abuse, it led to more punitive criminal justice and mass incarceration across the board for all infractions, not just sexual crimes. It also fundamentally changed the way parents raised their children, more fearfully, more supervision, less independence, more structure. And those children now are raising children \u2013 many of whom are already college age or older, a generation that reports through the roof levels of anxiety and depression. We are just coming up on four years since the beginning of the MeToo movement, we need to be mindful of the potential long term consequences of focusing on the wrong things, the wrong men in some cases. Some might argue that this viral meme is about \u201cawareness\u201d and would lead men to reconsider their beliefs, but all spreading memes like this accomplishes is se;f-congratulatory preaching to the choir. Men who rape or assault women have something broken in them; hearing other men make mildly misogynistic jokes didn\u2019t make them rapists any more than playing violent video games \u201ccreates\u201d mass shooters, and hearing some guy respond \u201cthat\u2019s not cool, bro\u201d to a misogynistic comment isn\u2019t going to fix what\u2019s wrong with them. And contrary to the pastiches of male culture some people have constructed in their heads, normal, decent guys don\u2019t sit around in groups letting misogynistic comments pass. I wouldn\u2019t stick around a group of guys where that was norm long enough to try to \u201cchange\u201d the men there, I just pick better friend groups than that. And any guy who is in a friend group that is bad enough that happens, if it\u2019s that pervasive, that friend group is already toxic, \u00a0all him calling it out will do it make him a target. The only men who both need to be convinced and also are capable of being convinced are men who aren\u2019t necessarily misogynistic, but don\u2019t give a lot of thought to the issue, and frankly, this hamfisted simplistic meme that paints all men with a broad brush is just going to turn those guys off. You can say \u201cthey should look past that and understand the intent\u201d or something like that, and maybe in an ideal world they should do that, but if they aren\u2019t doing that, you need to change your tactics. Do you want to be \u201cright\u201d, or do you want to successfully persuade people?","title":"A Risk Expert on why the \u201cMan or Bear\u201d \u201cthought experiment\u201d is worse than unhelpful","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1cjgxqn\/a_risk_expert_on_why_the_man_or_bear_thought\/"}

I thought maybe - being rather \"old\" - I was way out of touch.  But no - every article I looked up regarding that very early on referred to the \"sexiness\" of the suit.  Just what I thought - more so than a regular two piece (even one that exposes a lot of hip, breast, and below the navel but above the pubic area.  In my (maybe ignorant) view - it's the subliminal suggestion of the string (tied in a bow that can easily be undone) that creates the extra \"sexiness\".\n\nOne article had a comment from a mom \"I tell my daughter to double knot it so it can't be untied easily.  Whoah - obviously anyone who would do that ought to be arrested - but still, it acknowledges the subliminal suggestion.\n\nNow I won't say that many young girls make that choice but it IS available to them.  But that's only the most vivid case.  There are also \"cheeky\" suits (the actual term), and others that on a girl much older would definitely be considered \"sexy\".\n\nOK - what's the dilemma?  Telling her \"no\" to a two piece is body shaming IMO.  But at her age, she simply doesn't know what \"sexy\" even is.  So how do you steer her away from the \"sexy\" ones?

Preventing her from wearing what she wants \"just because\" is worse than giving in (imo).\n\nBut those can't be the only two choices.\n\nIt's a shame (no pun intended) that we talk about \"body positivity\" so much.  I FULLY agree no one should feel NEGATIVE about their body.  But why is one or the other?  Why not \"body neutrality?

It's their right - obviously.  But really, what is there to be proud of?  (I'm not talking about healthy or athletic bodies of course - only those that display themselves in a way commonly considered \"sexy\" by both men AND women.)\n\nIf - for example - a woman displays a lot of their breasts and they are above average - might that send a message to OTHER women that \"bigger really IS better\"?  I read comments saying \"sexiness\" makes them feel confident and empowered.  Confident and empowered to do what?  Succeed in their career?    \n\nWill my grandgirls all need to feel proud of their bodies (and sexuality) to do well in life?  Of course not.  NOT feel bad - yes.  Not feel guilty about sexuality - yes.  \n\nFlaunt it?  I would think not, and yet, to hear some women talk, it IS an advantage to them.\n\nWhy do women do that to themselves?  Or am I really out of touch.\n\nPlease - I'm NOT a prude or religious zealot.  And I'm not trying to be critical.

They have invested heavily into their people as manufacturing rose up to give them massive amounts of income and wealth to build up off of. \n\nWhen Republicans took office and control in 2000, China was handed a massive win for being the base manufacturing for tech and renewable energy research, development and construction. Giving them a booming economic lead to have a hands on control of the R&D of energy tech, letting them experiment with building construction, finance education and human development. \n\nWith Trump currently in office, a second time, we are watching him do the same thing as he did before. Create lots of chaos for allies, turn friends into enemies, isolate and alienate America to being hostile towards everyone including Canada of all places and sending constant shocks of rug pulling in American markets. America's wealthy are bringing in more money while the value of the dollar plumets, not really balancing out. \n\nAll this while Republicans are again disrupting and destroying the future of Americans. Americans have to pay retirement levels of wealth into healthcare and education instead of using that wealth to invest and build a family. The Trump administration is now going after students who can't pay their loans while forgiving businesses for committing fraud with the PPP loans during Covid. Countries are putting up Trump buildings and basically bribing Trump through his crypto to win favors and make deals with the States. \n\nThese bribes have shown the world that the Republican party is here to stay and will bully and harass everyone including Americans. They won't abide by any regulation or law if they can get away with it and will bend and change deals after they are made if they can get away with it. \n\nThis leaves China, who has been building global infrastructure for trade, working on manufacturing networks, improving it's R&D, making stable, reliable deals with countries including Canada and there's a very real possibility that China will be part of a Pacific NATO like organization with Japan, Koreas and so on. \n\nThe only thing China has to do is be stable, reliable, stoic and offer fair deals with everyone to further isolate the States as global business looks for a place to do business and they will win. Compared to what the Heritage Foundation has done so far in turning the States into Afghanistan with their similar policies of the Taliban and unstable dealings, using Republicans and Trump to disrupt and dismantle all of the effort and organizations that made the United States a stable, reliable ally, China is winning. \n\nTrump has been the best thing to happen for China. By letting the war in Ukraine continue, Russia isn't an issue. China basically owns Russia at this point. The only nation that's really threatening China is India who relies on the United States for stability. But with the States being in such chaos, India may actually start working with China as China continues it's effort to rise and take care of its people. \n\nPeople want to live in a stable, wealthy place. They want to make agreements and deals with a stable, reliable organization. They want to know agreements wont be ripped up out of nowhere or renegotiated in bad faith. All China has to do is be a better option than the Republican party and at this point, they are. \n\nI'm not rooting for this. I want my country to succeed. Trumps success is the success of the United States.  But in less than 90 days the Republican party has shredded in record time everything that made America great while screaming and claiming that somehow, with a population that can't afford healthcare or an education or the ability to raise a family, who are all under constant attack by businesses and Republicans calling workers lazy and entitled who said Covid was a bio weapon from China and that you should catch it and die for the economy...\n\nWe're cooked. \n\nWe have the best military in the world while Republicans install cyber back doors for Russia and China to hack into, steal everything and dismantle our information, intelligence and ability. \n\nI don't know what kind of sci-fi capabilities we have but that's not going to matter if we can't maintain, replace or build our cool military hardware and use them wisely.\n\nIf our people are rioting because they are dealing with debt, medical issues and problems due to the systems put in place to keep workers too exhausted to live life, too poor to invest, too tired to raise a family, too misinformed to make good choices, we got nothing. \n\nI know China isn't perfect.

If anything, they have proven just how much America helps people around the world even if the financial return isn't favorable. The States seems capable of affording it as well, but I'll get to that. \n\nIt's no secrete that republicans push Russian talking points and their narrative of suffering, attacking others, bullying and antagonizing everyone at the drop of a feather. Within a month Trump has turned the world against the States. Trump has ruined alliances, ruined the States Reputation in upholding agreements and is now leveraging some extremely one sided deals with Ukraine, [going so far as to call their leader a dictator and it's their fault, somehow, they got invaded by Russia. ](https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/administration\/5151545-trump-ukraine-zelensky-war-russia\/)\n\nThe goalpost for fraud has been moved from the deep state taking everyone's money to being upset that the States is sending money to help others, [similar to how the GDP of the United States seems to be trying to help Red States from total collapse.](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/trump-again-won-counties-representing-a-minority-share-of-national-gdp-but-with-notable-gains\/) \n\nMetaphorically, this is as if a bum was the neighbor of a rich, hard working person and started throwing a fit and getting angry that the rich person was feeding poor people in another city cand calling it fraud. At the very worst, it's wasteful spending. As seen, it's stabilizing the world, bringing people out of poverty, creating alliances and fostering fair trade. \n\nNow I see myself as conservative, generally speaking in terms of policies. But that involved charity, helping others, donations, security, safety, independence, helping others get on their feet, staying on your feet so you can help others. \n\nConservatism in the States have gone so far right, they are calling Trump a King, treating the Constitution like it's some liberal problem and trying to run a country like a private business which fails every time we see it in the real world. \n\nAs for spending, Democrats seem to know what they are doing. Though todays Democrats are yesterdays Republicans, they seem to have all the right moves of lowering deficit spending, raising taxes on those profiting from the system the most and luxuries to the point of being the only party in the last 60 years to be good for the economy. \n\nPer above, blue counties contribute more to the economy than red ones. Perhaps we should stop believing the people who cant run a clean county can properly govern the country. \n\nIf there's anything Trump has really shown me is that the path to presidency should be a progression from governing a city, county, state, then into the federal system.

Back then Facebook was mainstream social media. I was preteen at the time. I remember playing those facebook games and meeting strangers. People were so nice back then and it was so much fun. The downside is that I got addicted to social media at a young age. But I was happy. I vividly remember even 2017. Back then i made so many online friends and i still have 2 of them left to this day. I really loved how easy it was to make friends on social media. Everyone was nicer. Up until 2020 or i guess 2021-2022 because i noticed how meaner people were online around 2021(back then instagram was mainstream social media and instagram reels were introduced, i think, and people in the comments were so mean, they still are). But it\u2019s getting worse every year. After Instagram TikTok became mainstream social media platform and i am using it more than i should but lately I\u2019ve been thinking about deleting it. This used to be the nicest social media but i don\u2019t know what happened. People became too judgmental and rude. And even stupid if you ask me. The video will say something like \u201cTrying curly hair routine on my straight hair\u201d and people will point out that she is delusional for thinking she has curly hair. This is just an example but i see it a lot. It feels like people don\u2019t read the caption or they just don\u2019t watch the video before judging. People are just so judgmental now. They will only hype you up if you\u2019re pretty and skinny. What happened to body positivity? Why are they normalising the usage of Ozempic when they don\u2019t have diabetes? \n\nI was interdicted to reddit by tiktok. You know those text to speech and minecraft videos in the background? I thought reddit would be cool but damn you guys are so mean on here as well but i love how you can anonymously share your thoughts and no one will know who you are. The last thing i want is that former classmate i had in high school or anyone i know finding my reddit account(he is the first person who i learned about reddit from but knowing the type of person he is i assumed this app was full of cp, racism, sexism, homophobia and so on - not that i am wrong though). But that\u2019s why people on here are assholes. It\u2019s anonymous. \n\nBut just because you can\u2019t get beaten up through the screen doesn\u2019t mean that you can be an asshole online. Unfortunately most of the people are so miserable and mean online. I am trying so hard to be positive because i can feel myself slipping into that version of me that lacks empathy because \u201cWhy did you even get yourself in this situation?\u201d(yeah the good old victim blaming) instead of being like \u201cI am so sorry this happened to you. It\u2019s not your fault because you had no idea it would happen.\u201d and i hate it. I often catch myself thinking like an asshole without any empathy because people around me(both online and in real life) are like that and \u201cYou become what you surround yourself with.\u201d or whatever was the saying. \n\nYeah people in real life also got so much meaner. I am still scared of talking to people because i fear i will be judged because people are more judgmental than ever now. I have no idea why. Was it the COVID pandemic? Is it because people work a job they hate for tons of hours overtime and barely afford to live? Is it because they are jealous of people who have their life together? What is it?\n\n\nTL;DR for the people with damaged attention span: People online and in real life are meaner than they used to be. Most of them lack empathy and sometimes i can feel myself acting like an asshole and i am trying so hard to stay empathetic and positive. I think the pandemic is particularly the reason why but it could be because people spend most of their life working jobs that they hate and don\u2019t pay them enough.

There is no American Dream. I say it\u2019s not like that anymore alluding that in the past you could live off much smaller incomes because it really was true. My grandma worked part time at a sandwich shop during college and had no issue paying her tuition. There were families in the late 70s that had 10 kids and were able to buy a shore house. People were able to live off a single income that came from basic careers, nothing crazy or anything! I know people will say people didn\u2019t have all of these phone bills or tv bills we have now but those expenses shouldn\u2019t add up to families barely being able to afford groceries. I\u2019m currently in the process of figuring out what I want to do for the rest of my life but in the back of my head I have this voice telling me to make sure I have a livable income rather than doing something I love and it\u2019s sad. There have been times where I have found interest in a field but learned that I wouldn\u2019t have a comfortable living as I would be worrying about money all the time. It\u2019s not even that I want to be making bank it\u2019s all about just being comfortable and even that is getting harder to achieve. I grew up too hearing all about my families financial situation and that sucked and has stuck with me, I don\u2019t want to have that level of stress all the time. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s sad how many people light up when you ask them \u201cIf money wasn\u2019t an issue what career would you pursue?\u201d. Also I see myself holding so much resentment against people who do decide to follow what the actually want to do and, this is going to sound so bad, but I\u2019ll be like \u201cSomeone had a wealthy upbringing.\u201d Now I KNOW following what you love and disregarding the money doesn\u2019t  mean you grew up rich, hell I\u2019m so so privileged, but just from many people I had encounters with many of them don\u2019t seem to be thinking about the logistics of living off of a 45k a year salary, they are living in fairy land. I think people who grew up in similar situations as me will understand almost knowing too much for your own good, seeing stuff so clearly and how they are that it sucks sometimes, because that\u2019s at least how it is for me. I\u2019m grateful I know that I can\u2019t pursue certain careers since I literally wouldn\u2019t be able to live but still it\u2019s really sad. Anyways, I\u2019m very passionate about this topic and if anyone has any thoughts I would love to hear them.","title":"It\u2019s sad how many people aren\u2019t able to pursue the career they genuinely want to because of the pay.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1hd2jme\/its_sad_how_many_people_arent_able_to_pursue_the\/"}

In a perfect world (or at least one better than it is today), Israel would not have been created in 1948 and displaced the people of Palestine.\n\nThat being said, tens of thousands of pro-Palestine protestors are going to demonstrate outside the DNC next week, and I can't help but think this is counterproductive. Kamala Harris is by no means pro-Palestine, but if she loses, that means Donald Trump will become President. *Donald Trump*, who is not only so dangerous on so many other issues, but who has also pledged to nuke Gaza and deport all the pro-Palestine protestors. I think it's very telling that they aren't protesting the Republicans too, only the Democrats. \n\nMoreover, let's say that they \"succeed\" and Harris loses to Trump. There is every reason to believe that in such a scenario, many in the Democratic Party would blame these protestors for their loss (much as they blamed Bernie Sanders for Trump's 2016 victory, and for the record, I voted for Bernie in the 2020 primary). Assuming that the 2028 election is free and fair, it seems logical to me that the pro-Palestine movement would get less of a say in the DNC's platform that election, not more. And if their goal is to elect Trump for accelerationist purposes, has that *ever* worked in history?\n\nAgain, I do not support the genocide of the Palestinian people (even if my government does). If I could snap my fingers and move to Canada right now with the clothes on my back and my laptop (and no longer be responsible for genocide), I'd like to think I would do it. \nBut it boggles my mind that the people protesting this are only attacking the Democrats, not the even more pro-Israel Republicans.\n\nDiscuss.","title":"What do the DNC protestors think they'll accomplish?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1eswzvj\/what_do_the_dnc_protestors_think_theyll_accomplish\/"}

It's true. If you're different and not like other southerners or you don't conform to their arbitrary, stupid cultural norms, then they'll act stupid, disrespectful and aggressive.\n\nI'm from the south; I was born and raised here. It's true. If you're not like other southerners or you don't conform to their arbitrary, stupid cultural norms or their lame and toxic cultural conservatism, then they'll act stupid, disrespectful and aggressive. They become outright bullies then, in many instances.\n\nI was raised in a smallish southern town of over 20,000 people. I hate small towns and I especially hate southern small towns. I moved away from that horrible small town, wherein I was raised, and I moved to a large city that is still in the southern U.S.\n\nThe only gems in the southern U.S. are the amazing cities or some smaller towns or rural areas such as Asheville, NC, Boone, NC, Byson City, NC, Chimney Rock, NC, Blowing Rock, NC, Charleston, SC, Atlanta, GA or New Orleans, Louisiana and maybe Charlotte, NC and some its surrounding areas such as Huntersville, Matthews or Concord.\n\nMany southerners have a lack of empathy, hostility, aggression, narrow mindedness and intolerance toward people anybody who is different or not like them.\n\nIf you conform to their stupid and toxic southern redneck small town cultural norms, then they're respectful. If you don't fit into their mold, then they're disrespectful, awful people.\n\nI totally agree with that statement about performing masculinity. If you don't perform their stupid, toxic, hyper masculine stereotypical nonsense just the way they prefer it, then they'll be southern idiots attacking you for being different or not being masculine in the ways they want.\n\nIn many southern areas, if a man isn't interested in football, basketball, or baseball he's considered \"gay\", effeminate, or otherwise not masculine enough.\n\nIf you're happily single and child free, then many southerners will be disrespectful, aggressive or hostile. In the southern U.S., many southerners strongly believe in following the traditional social norms or traditional social expectation of marriage and kids.\n\nThere seems to be a strong emphasis upon conformity and collectivism. Many southerners act like it's not ok to be different in any way if it doesn't fit in with their social group.\n\nThese people care more about fitting in with a social group and maintaining a certain status quo, even if that status quo is negative.\n\nBut I will say that they think it's ok if they think that everyone else is doing it. Or they think a certain behavior is ok or they will at least accept it if they think their friend, their grandma or their peers do it.\n\nWhat we all need to remember is that these characteristics of fake niceness, conformity, collectivism, bullying and intolerance are not uniquely southern U.S. cultural characteristics.\n\nEach part of the United States has the exact same negative characteristics that you'll find in the southern U.S. Everything negative about the southern U.S. exists in other parts of the country to lesser or more degrees.\n\nAgain, the southern U.S. is about conformity, narrow mindedness, insularity, hypocrisy and unfairness.\n\nI'm a black woman. I also really hate most things about southern U.S. culture and I hate most things about southeastern U.S. culture.\n\nIt just seems like, especially when you live in the south (and frankly even when you live anywhere), if you're different or unconventional or just think for yourself and do your own thing you will be stigmatized or even bullied or harassed or seen as a problem or a threat that must be ostracized or picked on or attacked. That's my personal experience and it has been my experience throughout my life.\n\nI'm a black woman and I was born and raised in the southern U.S. I'll speak the truth and say this:\n\nMany black people, especially in the south, seem very narrow minded and they seem like they want to fit into stereotypes. Most black people, in the south or anywhere else in the U.S., only listen to rap or RnB. They don't appreciate any other genres of music and it makes them seem boring, closed minded, insular and stereotypical.\n\nThere's this mindset amongst the above-mentioned types of black people that any black person who thinks or acts in a way that is not stereotypically black is \"acting white\" or \"talking white\". That's a mentality that's common amongst many black American adults as well as many black American youth.\n\nMany black people in America, especially within many areas of the southeast, deep south, or within the northeast, seem like they want to be one-dimensional stereotypes of what it means to be \"black\" and they want to conform to one-dimensional and stereotypical aspects of \"black culture\" which only include rap music and rap culture.\n\nMany black people, in America or within the southern U.S. and elsewhere, believe in conformity, group think and echo chambers concerning their political opinions, musical genre preferences, hobbies, interests, and just about any other aspect of life. They encourage the toxic and horrible values of conformity, group think and collectivism.\n\nTo be considered \"black enough\" and to fit in with the black racial group, you have to look like every other black person, talk like every other black person, act like every other black person or listen to the same music as every other black person around you or you'll be considered weird for being different and you'll be perceived as someone who is being disloyal to the black racial group.\n\nBlack people bullying, ignoring, isolating, ostracizing or belittling other black people who are perceived as being different and not fitting i","title":"As a 31 year old lifelong southerner, bullying and disrespect of anyone different or non-conforming to conservative, traditionalist values is tolerated and encouraged in the Southern U.S., especially within Southern U.S. small towns.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Discussion\/comments\/1efcd8z\/as_a_31_year_old_lifelong_southerner_bullying_and\/"}
